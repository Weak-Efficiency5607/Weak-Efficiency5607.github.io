				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Symptoms-fever.jpg/800px-Symptoms-fever.jpg"></img></li>
					<li>Anti-infection defense mechanism that appears with body temperature exceeding the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point in the hypothalamus.</li>
					<li>The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.</li>
					<li>May rarely trigger a febrile seizure. This is more common in young children.</li>
					<li>Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (106 to 108 °F).</li>
					<li>A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening. This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections—such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa fever, COVID-19, and malaria.</li>
					<li>Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer.</li>
					<li>Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, may be useful and help a person rest.</li>
					<li>Medications (e.g. ibuprofen or paracetamol) may help with this as well as lower temperature.</li>
					<li>Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms.</li>
					<li>One of the most common medical signs.</li>
					<li>It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.</li>
					<li>A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, dehydration,and the inability to concentrate.</li>
					<li>Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called "fever dreams".</li>
					<li>Mild to severe delirium (which can also cause hallucinations) may also present itself during high fevers.</li>
					<li>Clinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes.</li>
					<li><h2>Behavior</h2></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Various patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous fever, where temperature remains above normal and does not fluctuate more than 1 °C in 24 hours (e.g. in bacterial pneumonia, typhoid fever, infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, or typhus).</li>
							<li>Intermittent fever is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal (e.g., in malaria, leishmaniasis, pyemia, sepsis, or African trypanosomiasis).</li>
							<li>Remittent fever, where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 °C in 24 hours (e.g., in infective endocarditis or brucellosis).</li>
							<li>Pel–Ebstein fever is a cyclic fever that is rarely seen in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.</li>
							<li>Undulant fever, seen in brucellosis.</li>
							<li>Typhoid fever is a continuous fever showing a characteristic step-ladder pattern, a step-wise increase in temperature with a high plateau.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Among the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Quotidian fever, with a 24-hour periodicity, typical of malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi);</li>
							<li>Tertian fever, with a 48-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. falciparum, P. vivax, or P. ovale;</li>
							<li>Quartan fever, with a 72-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. malariae.</li>
						</ul>

						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Adult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.</li>
					<li>In addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.</li>
					<li>Assist the healing process in ways, including:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Increased mobility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell">leukocytes</a>;</li>
						<li>Increased proliferation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell">T cells</a>.</li>
						<li>Enhanced leukocyte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte">phagocytosis</a>;</li>
						<li>Decreased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide">endotoxin</a> effects;</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Temperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response. When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate.</li>
					<li>If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Increased heat production by increased muscle tone, shivering (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like epinephrine; and</li>
						<li>Prevention of heat loss, e.g., through vasoconstriction.</li>

					<li>Can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine</li>
					<li>found in many high-protein food products such as</li>
					<ul>
						<li>meat</li>
						<li>fish</li>
						<li>cheese</li>
						<li>cottage cheese</li>

					<li>In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).</li>

					<li>Functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase.</li>
						<li>Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes.</li>
						<li>Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.</li>
						<li>Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids.</li>
						<li>Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).</li>
					<li>Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs.</li>

					<li>Phytochemical components of turmeric include diarylheptanoids, a class including numerous curcuminoids, such as curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin.</li>
					<li>Curcumin constitutes up to 3.14% of assayed commercial samples of turmeric powder (the average was 1.51%); curry powder contains much less (an average of 0.29%). Some 34 essential oils are present in turmeric, among which turmerone, germacrone, atlantone, and zingiberene are major constituents.</li>
					<li>Curcuma, or turmeric, induces CYP1A2, potentially decreasing levels of antidepressants and antipsychotics, and increases sulfasalazine levels.</li>

					<li>Cow milk contains components like antibodies and lactoferrin, which may bolster the immune system, especially in young children. It also has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, potentially aiding in fighting infections. However, its hormonal content, like IGF-1, may influence growth, though this is still being researched.</li>
					<li>Beyond nutrition, cow milk has bioactive compounds like transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), used in treating conditions like Crohn’s disease, showing its potential beyond just food.</li>
					<li>Cow milk is primarily composed of water (about 87%), with the remainder consisting of proteins, fats, lactose, vitamins, and minerals. The average composition, as outlined in "Milk composition and microbiology - Milk composition", includes 4.9% lactose, 3.4% fat, 3.3% protein, and 0.7% minerals.</li>
					<li>Cow milk, particularly colostrum, contains high levels of antibodies and immune factors, which can modulate the immune system. Lactoferrin, a key protein found in cow milk at concentrations of 2–3 g/L.</li>
					<li>Cow milk contains casein, which can be broken down into casomorphins, peptides with opioid-like activity. These compounds have been detected in blood after milk consumption, potentially influencing gastrointestinal function or appetite, though their physiological significance in humans is not fully established.</li>
					<li>Lactose, the primary carbohydrate in cow milk, provides energy but can cause digestive issues in individuals with lactose intolerance, leading to symptoms like diarrhea and bloating ("Milk: Health benefits and nutrition"). Additionally, milk contains oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics, supporting gut health by promoting beneficial bacteria, as discussed in "Frontiers | Composition, Structure, and Digestive Dynamics of Milk From Different Species—A Review". These gastrointestinal effects are significant pharmacological actions, particularly for those with sensitivities.</li>
					<li>A milk cytokine, has been shown to promote remission in pediatric Crohn’s disease when supplemented in enteric nutrition formulas.</li>
					<li>Milk glycans, including oligosaccharides, show promise as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents in preclinical studies.</li>

				<li id="alone-same">SAMe</li>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/S-adenosyl_methionine.png"></img></li>
					<li>Also known as: S-adenosyl-L-methionine and AdoMet</li>
					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Depression: SAMe is implicated in enhancing neurotransmitter activity, particularly dopamine and serotonin turnover, which may improve mood regulation. Research indicates it increases levels of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, lowers serum prolactin, and impacts the noradrenergic system by modifying adrenergic receptor activity. It enhances methylation of catecholamines, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, and may boost gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), potentially supporting neurogenesis. Clinical effects often take weeks to manifest, with studies suggesting improvements noticeable after 4-12 weeks at doses of 200-1600 mg/day, though individual response times vary.</li>
						<li>Osteoarthritis: SAMe appears to support joint health by stimulating the production of collagen and proteoglycans, key components of cartilage. It also exhibits painkilling and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially reducing joint pain and stiffness. Mechanisms may include reducing inflammatory mediators, increasing glutathione levels, and signaling cartilage synthesis or survival, though exact pathways are not fully elucidated. Studies suggest benefits may be seen after several weeks, with doses of 600-1200 mg/day used for up to 84 days, showing gradual improvements in functional limitations and pain.</li>
						<li>Liver Disease: SAMe plays a critical role in liver health, acting as a precursor for glutathione, which enhances antioxidant defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS). It attenuates pro-inflammatory TNFα-mediated liver injury, induces anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, and protects hepatocytes from apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial cytochrome-c release and caspase-3 activation. It also influences membrane fluidity and bile salt export, aiding in conditions like intra-hepatic cholestasis. Clinical trials, such as a multi-center study with 220 patients at 1600 mg/day, showed symptom improvement within weeks, with effects on cholestasis indices noted early in treatment.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pharmacokinetic Properties</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Half-life: The half-life for intravenous administration is approximately 80-100 minutes, based on studies with doses like 100 mg, 500 mg, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight. For oral administration, the apparent half-life may be longer due to absorption dynamics, with some studies reporting values around 7.77-16.01 hours for novel formulations, suggesting variability based on formulation and absorption rate. This discrepancy highlights the need for further research into oral pharmacokinetics.</li>
						<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, estimated at 1-3% for standard formulations, attributed to poor intestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism in the liver. Novel formulations, such as enteric-coated tablets (e.g., MSI-195), can increase bioavailability to around 9%, as seen in pharmacokinetic studies comparing AUC ratios. Intramuscular bioavailability is higher, at 80-90%, offering a more efficient route for systemic exposure. The presence of food can reduce absorption, with studies showing a 55% reduction in AUC when taken with food compared to fasted states.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Dosage and Safety Considerations</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dosage Ranges:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Safe Range: Clinical studies commonly use doses up to 1600 mg/day, with evidence suggesting safety for periods up to two years in conditions like alcohol-related liver disease. Doses are typically divided, taken with or without food, though absorption may be better on an empty stomach.</li>
							<li>Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition. For depression, studies start at 200 mg/day, escalating to 1600 mg/day for non-responders. For osteoarthritis, effective doses range from 600-1200 mg/day, and for liver disease, 800-1200 mg/day is common, based on trial data.</li>
							<li>Maximum Safe Dose: While 1600 mg/day is well-tolerated, higher doses lack extensive safety data. Given mild side effects at higher doses, caution is advised beyond this, especially without medical supervision.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Toxicity and LD50:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Animal studies provide insight into acute toxicity, with an oral LD50 in rats greater than 4650 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity. Human data on LD50 is unavailable due to ethical constraints, but studies at 1600 mg/day show no significant toxic methylated metabolites or homocysteine elevation, suggesting a wide safety margin.</li>
							<li>Chronic toxicity is less studied, but long-term use at therapeutic doses shows mild side effects like gastrointestinal upset, headache, and insomnia, particularly at higher doses.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Onset of Danger: Determining when SAMe becomes dangerous is complex. High doses may exacerbate side effects, and in vulnerable populations, such as those with bipolar disorder, even therapeutic doses (e.g., 200-1600 mg/day) can trigger mania, as noted in case reports. The risk increases with pre-existing conditions, and individual sensitivity varies, necessitating medical oversight for high-dose regimens.</li>

					<li>Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia by chemically reducing the ferric iron in hemoglobin to ferrous iron.</li>
					<li>Methylene blue, when injected intravenously as an antidote, is itself first reduced to leucomethylene blue, which then reduces the heme group from methemoglobin to hemoglobin.</li>
					<li>At high doses, however, methylene blue actually induces methemoglobinemia, reversing this pathway.</li>
					<li>Since its reduction potential is similar to that of oxygen and can be reduced by components of the electron transport chain, large doses of methylene blue are sometimes used as an antidote to potassium cyanide poisoning, a method first successfully tested in 1933 by Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks in San Francisco, although first demonstrated by Bo Sahlin of Lund University, in 1926.</li>

					<li>Another use of methylene blue is to treat ifosfamide neurotoxicity.</li>
					<li>Methylene blue increases blood pressure in people with vasoplegic syndrome (redistributive shock), but does not improve delivery of oxygen to tissues or decrease mortality.</li>
					<li>Methylene blue has been used in calcium channel blocker toxicity as a possible rescue therapy for distributive shock unresponsive to first line agents.</li>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Inositol.svg"></img></li>
					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Cellular Signaling: Inositol is a critical component of the phosphoinositide cycle, serving as a second messenger in intracellular signal transduction pathways. It facilitates communication within cells, influencing processes like hormone response and growth factor signaling (<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13178">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Insulin Sensitization: It enhances insulin sensitivity, which is particularly beneficial for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and metabolic syndrome. Studies suggest it improves insulin action, potentially reducing blood glucose levels and aiding in conditions associated with insulin resistance (<a href="https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Neurotransmitter Modulation: Inositol influences neurotransmitter synthesis, notably serotonin, which impacts mood and mental health. It has been explored for treating depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with evidence suggesting it modulates neurotransmitter activity in the brain (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/inositol">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Osmoregulation: In the brain, Inositol acts as an osmolyte, helping maintain cell volume and fluid balance, which is crucial for neurological function. Its concentration is notably high in brain tissue, supporting osmoregulation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Structural Role: As phosphatidylinositol, it is a structural component of cell membranes, contributing to membrane integrity and function (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7554709/">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The onset of clinical effects for these actions varies, with research indicating that therapeutic benefits, particularly for mental health and metabolic conditions, are typically observed within 2-4 weeks (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/inositol">source</a>). This timeline aligns with the need for sustained supplementation to achieve significant physiological changes, especially for chronic conditions.</li>
					<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Half-Life: Studies in preterm infants report a half-life of approximately 5-8 hours, with specific values ranging from 5.22 hours to 7.90 hours (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/inositol">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Bioavailability: Inositol is absorbed from the small intestine, with oral ingestion leading to peak plasma concentrations around 4 hours post-dose, indicating good oral bioavailability (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5666868/">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Dosage and Safety</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Therapeutic Doses: For mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, doses typically range from 12-18 g/day, often taken in divided doses (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896029/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Safe Range and Side Effects: Inositol is generally considered safe up to 18 g/day, with side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and gas reported at doses above 12 g/day (<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/inositol-what-should-i-know-about-it-89466">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition, with research suggesting 1-2 g/day as effective for some metabolic benefits, while higher doses are needed for mental health, starting at 12 g/day (<a href="https://examine.com/supplements/inositol/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Maximum Safe Dose: Not explicitly defined, but studies using doses up to 18 g/day for extended periods (e.g., 3 months) report no significant adverse effects, indicating a high safety margin (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896029/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>LD50 and Toxicity: In rats, the LD50 is reported as 10 g/kg body weight orally, indicating very low toxicity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol">source</a>). For a 70 kg human, this translates to 700 g, far exceeding typical therapeutic doses, suggesting minimal risk of toxicity at recommended levels.</li>
						<li>Dangerous Doses: Given the high LD50 and lack of reported serious toxicity, dangerous levels likely exceed 18 g/day, but specific thresholds are not established. Side effects at higher doses are mild, suggesting a wide therapeutic window, though caution is advised above 18 g/day due to potential mineral absorption issues at very high doses (<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/inositol-what-should-i-know-about-it-89466">source</a>).</li>

					<li>Fluoxetine can affect the electrical currents that heart muscle cells use to coordinate their contraction, specifically the potassium currents Ito and IKs that repolarise the cardiac action potential. Under certain circumstances, this can lead to prolongation of the QT interval, a measurement made on an electrocardiogram reflecting how long it takes for the heart to electrically recharge after each heartbeat. When fluoxetine is taken alongside other drugs that prolong the QT interval, or by those with a susceptibility to long QT syndrome, there is a small risk of potentially lethal abnormal heart rhythms such as torsades de pointes. A study completed in 2011 found that fluoxetine does not alter the QT interval and has no clinically meaningful effects on the cardiac action potential.</li>
					<li>Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 enzymes.</li>
					<li>Patients who are taking NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements must be careful when taking fluoxetine or other SSRIs, as they can sometimes increase the blood-thinning effects of these medications.</li>

					<li>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a coenzyme essential for energy production and cellular health, often linked to anti-aging benefits. However, when it comes to taking pure NAD+ orally, the evidence leans toward it being ineffective due to challenges with absorption in the digestive system.</li>
					<li>Pure NAD+ seems likely to be broken down in the stomach, reducing its ability to reach cells in an active form. This is why supplements often use precursors like NR and NMN, which the body can convert into NAD+ more efficiently.</li>
					<li>If you're considering NAD+ for health benefits, oral supplements are typically in the form of precursors, not pure NAD+.</li>
					<li>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical coenzyme found in all living cells, playing a central role in metabolism, particularly in redox reactions that generate energy. It exists in two forms: NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced), and is essential for processes like mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation, which are linked to healthy aging. Given its importance, there has been growing interest in NAD+ supplementation, especially as levels decline with age, potentially contributing to age-related diseases.</li>
					<li>To provide context, precursors like NR and NMN have been more extensively studied for oral use. Chronic supplementation with NR was well-tolerated and increased NAD+ levels in healthy middle-aged and older adults, with potential benefits for blood pressure and arterial stiffness <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5876407/">Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NAD+ in healthy middle-aged and older adults</a>.</li>

					<li>Pharmacological Actions and Potencies</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Reversible Inhibition of Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B): Safinamide acts as a selective and reversible inhibitor of MAO-B, an enzyme responsible for dopamine degradation. This action increases dopamine levels in the brain, enhancing dopaminergic activity. The IC50 for MAO-B inhibition is consistently reported as 98 nM, with a selectivity ratio over MAO-A of approximately 5918-fold, indicated by an MAO-A IC50 of 580 μM. This high selectivity reduces the risk of hypertensive crises associated with non-selective MAO inhibitors.</li>
						<li>Blockade of Voltage-Dependent Sodium Channels: Safinamide also blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, with a noted IC50 of 8 μM at depolarized potentials and 262 μM at resting potentials. This use- and frequency-dependent blockade suggests a preference for active neuronal states, potentially contributing to its effects on neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release.</li>
						<li>Blockade of N-Type Calcium Channels: The drug is known to block N-type calcium channels, a subtype critical for neurotransmitter release. However, specific IC50 values for this action were not found in the reviewed literature, indicating a gap in detailed potency data. This mechanism likely contributes to its neuroprotective effects by modulating calcium-dependent processes.</li>
						<li>Inhibition of Glutamate Release: Safinamide inhibits glutamate release, with an IC50 of 8 μM, which may be a downstream effect of its sodium and calcium channel blockade. This action is particularly relevant in Parkinson's disease, where excessive glutamatergic activity can exacerbate motor symptoms and contribute to neuronal damage.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pharmacokinetic Properties</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Half-Life: The terminal half-life ranges from 20 to 26 hours, allowing for sustained effects and steady-state concentrations achieved within 5-6 days of consistent dosing. This duration supports its use in maintaining therapeutic levels over extended periods.</li>
						<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is reported at 95%, with no significant first-pass metabolism. Food slightly delays the time to maximum concentration (Tmax, 2-3 hours) but does not affect the area under the curve (AUC) or maximum concentration (Cmax), ensuring reliable absorption.</li>
						<li>Distribution and Metabolism: The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is approximately 165 L, with an unbound fraction of 11-12%. Metabolism primarily occurs via non-microsomal cytosolic amidases and minor CYP3A4 activity, producing inactive metabolites like NW-1689 (161% parent exposure), NW-1689 AG (18%), and NW-1153 (11%). Excretion is predominantly renal (76%), with 5% excreted unchanged.</li>
						<li>Special Populations: No significant effects on pharmacokinetics were noted for age, race, sex, or renal impairment. However, hepatic impairment increases exposure, with mild impairment raising AUC by 30% and moderate by 80%, necessitating dosage adjustments (maximum 50 mg/day in moderate hepatic impairment, contraindicated in severe).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Dosage and Safety Considerations</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Recommended Dosage Range: The standard dosage is 50-100 mg once daily, initiated at 50 mg and potentially increased after two weeks based on individual response and tolerability. Dosages above 100 mg daily have not shown additional benefits and may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions, particularly in the context of MAO-B inhibition.</li>
						<li>Minimum Effective Dose: Clinical studies, such as the SETTLE and MOTION trials, indicate that 50 mg/day is effective, improving ON-time without troublesome dyskinesias and motor function, making it the minimum effective dose.</li>
						<li>Maximum Safe Dose: The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg/day, as higher doses are not advised due to potential increased adverse effects without therapeutic gain. This is supported by pharmacodynamic data showing no additional benefit and increased risk at higher doses.</li>
						<li>LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: Specific LD50 values for Safinamide were not found in public literature, and there is no human experience with overdose reported. Preclinical toxicology data from the EMA assessment report indicate adverse effects at high doses in animals (e.g., convulsions at ≥70 mg/kg/day in monkeys, hepatotoxicity at NOAEL 45 mg/kg/day in rats), but these do not translate directly to human LD50. Overdose symptoms, as noted in clinical observations, include hypertension, hallucinations, and dyskinesia, with no specific antidote available, requiring supportive care and dietary tyramine restriction for several weeks post-overdose.</li>
						<li>When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Doses exceeding 100 mg/day are considered potentially dangerous, as they increase the risk of adverse effects without additional benefit, based on clinical trial data and regulatory guidance. However, exact thresholds for severe toxicity are not well-defined due to limited overdose data.</li>

					</ul>
					<li><h2>Anti-inflammatory Action</h2></li>
					<li>CBD, CBDA, CBG, and terpenes like beta-caryophyllene contribute to anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-2 and activating CB2 receptors, which are part of the immune response regulation.</li>
					<li><h2>Antiepileptic Action</h2></li>
					<li>CBD is particularly noted for its antiepileptic properties, with FDA approval for treating certain epilepsy types, such as Dravet syndrome. This effect is mediated through interactions with GABA-A receptors and TRP channels.</li>
					<li><h2>Anxiolytic Action</h2></li>
					<li>CBD's interaction with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is believed to reduce anxiety, offering potential for mental health applications.</li>
					<li><h2>Neuroprotective Action</h2></li>
					<li>Both CBD and flavonoids exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's. This is linked to their antioxidant properties and interactions with the endocannabinoid system.</li>
					<li><h2>Antioxidant Action</h2></li>
					<li>Flavonoids and other compounds in hemp, such as cannflavin A, provide antioxidant effects by neutralizing free radicals.</li>
					<li><h2>Analgesic Action</h2></li>
					<li>CBD and other cannabinoids may relieve pain by interacting with the endocannabinoid system and pain pathways, offering potential for pain management.</li>
					<li><h2>Anticancer Potential</h2></li>
					<li>CBDA has shown preliminary evidence of inhibiting cancer cell migration, suggesting a role in cancer research.</li>
					<li><h2>Modulation of the Endocannabinoid System</h2></li>
					<li>Many hemp compounds interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors, influencing mood, pain perception, appetite, and immune function.</li>
					<li><h2>Nutritional and Additional Pharmacological Considerations</h2></li>
					<li>Hemp seeds, rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, contribute to cardiovascular health and anti-inflammatory effects, though these are more nutritional than directly pharmacological in the context of bioactive compounds.</li>
					<li>Essential oils from hemp also exhibit antibacterial and insecticidal properties, which may have therapeutic applications in infection control, though these are less directly relevant to human pharmacology.</li>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277986735/figure/fig2/AS:613507796070405@1523283065230/Shiitake-mushroom-L-edodes-A-Fruit-body-B-Spores-C-Basidia-D-Cheilocystidia.png"></img></li>
					<li>Immune System Enhancement: Lentinan, a β-glucan, is known to stimulate the immune system, potentially aiding in slowing tumor growth and enhancing resistance to infections. Studies indicate it increases immune cell proliferation and activation, such as γδ-T cells and natural killer T (NK-T) cells, and boosts secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in saliva, as seen in a 2015 study involving daily consumption (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25866155/">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Antiviral and Antibacterial Effects: Lentinan has shown antiviral effects against poliovirus type 1 and bovine herpes virus type 1, and antibacterial effects by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity and activating macrophage-mediated responses, according to <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/shiitake-mushroom">research from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.</li>
					<li>Antifungal Properties: Shiitake extracts have demonstrated antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of certain fungal pathogens.</li>
					<li>Cancer-Related Effects: Lentinan does not directly kill cancer cells but enhances immune responses that may slow tumor growth. It has been studied for its potential to inhibit leukemic cell proliferation, suppress HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells via caspase-3 and -8 pathways. A <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/shiitake-mushroom">clinical trial</a> showed oral lentinan formulations extending survival in patients with stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers, though a Shiitake extract alone was ineffective for prostate cancer treatment.</li>
					<li>Immune Modulation: Shiitake alters immune function by increasing levels of cytokines like IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α, while decreasing MIP-1alpha/CCL3 levels, suggesting a less inflammatory state, as noted in immune studies.</li>
					<li>Antihypercholemic Effects: Eritadenine, a compound in Shiitake, regulates lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase and upregulating CYP7A1 mRNA, potentially lowering blood cholesterol. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065216408705951">Studies</a> in rats fed Shiitake showed reduced plasma cholesterol levels, attributed to both eritadenine and dietary fiber.</li>
					<li>Anti-Obesity Potential: High doses of Shiitake in rat studies prevented obesity by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver, suggesting a role in fat metabolism regulation.</li>
					<li>Other Effects: Shiitake inhibits lung cancer cells via the Latcripin-13 domain, suppresses cytochrome P450 1A enzymes, and increases serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, indicating broad pharmacological activity.</li>
					<li>Safe Dose Range</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Food Consumption: Shiitake mushrooms are generally considered safe when cooked and consumed in typical dietary amounts. Studies and dietary guidelines suggest a range of 50-200 grams per day for healthy adults, based on nutritional intake. For instance, a cup of cooked Shiitake (approximately 145 grams) provides significant nutrients like copper and selenium, and sources like Verywellfit suggest up to 2 cups (290 grams) for balanced diets, though this may be high for daily consumption. FreshCap Mushrooms notes three to eight mushrooms per day, which, at an average weight of 15-20 grams each, translates to 45-160 grams, aligning with this range (<a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/the-health-benefits-of-shiitake-mushrooms-89077">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Medicinal Use: For medicinal purposes, such as extracts or dried forms, the safe dosage is less defined. A specific extract, AHCC (Active Hexose Correlated Compound), derived from Shiitake, is considered possibly safe at 4.5-6 grams daily for up to 6 months or 3 grams daily for up to 9 years, according to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-680/shiitake-mushroom">WebMD</a>. Studies on dried Shiitake used doses of 5-10 grams daily, equivalent to about 50-100 grams fresh, showing immune benefits. However, using Shiitake in larger medicinal amounts or raw can be unsafe, potentially causing stomach discomfort, blood abnormalities, and skin reactions like shiitake dermatitis.</li>
						<li>Considerations: The literature emphasizes consulting healthcare professionals for medicinal use, especially for those with autoimmune diseases, as Shiitake may increase immune activity, potentially worsening conditions like multiple sclerosis or lupus. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should avoid medicinal amounts due to insufficient safety data.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Given the variability, a safe dose range for food is likely 50-200 grams daily of cooked Shiitake, while medicinal doses should be guided by product labels or professional advice, typically 5-10 grams of dried extract daily based on studies.</li>
					<li>Safe Dose Range</li>
					<ul>
						<li>General Bioavailability: Research indicates that Shiitake’s active compounds, especially polysaccharides, have low oral bioavailability. Lentinan, a key β-glucan, is noted for poor systemic absorption due to its high molecular weight (400-800 kDa) and is often administered intraperitoneally in studies for better efficacy, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.drugs.com/npp/lentinan.html">Drugs.com</a>, due to rapid metabolism and low oral bioavailability. This suggests that oral ingestion may not result in significant blood levels, with effects likely mediated through gut interactions.</li>
						<li>Gut Microbiome Interaction: Edible mushroom polysaccharides (EMPs) are resistant to human digestive enzymes and serve as energy sources for gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacteria growth, as per a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10358859/">PMC review</a>. This implies that their bioactivity is more local, affecting gut immunity and microbiome composition rather than systemic circulation.</li>
						<li>Effect of Food (Empty vs. Full Stomach): There is no specific data on whether taking Shiitake on an empty stomach versus with food significantly alters bioavailability. Given that polysaccharides are not readily absorbed and act primarily in the gut, it seems likely that the presence of food would not substantially change absorption, as their effects are mediated through fermentation and immune modulation rather than systemic uptake.</li>
						<li>Commercial Claims: Some commercial products, like Hifas da Terra, claim enhanced bioavailability through extraction methods, but these are not backed by peer-reviewed studies for general Shiitake consumption. For instance, a French Mush X post mentions 92% bioavailability for their extracts, but this is a marketing claim without scientific validation.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The safe dose range was inferred from both culinary consumption patterns (50-200 grams daily) and medicinal studies (5-10 grams dried).</li>

					<li>It induces the cytochrome P450 system, particularly the CYP3A4 enzyme, and P-glycoprotein, which are critical for metabolizing and transporting various drugs. This induction can lead to increased metabolism of co-administered medications, potentially reducing their efficacy. For instance, a 2009 PMC article by Izzo highlights that St. John's wort induces CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2C19, with no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9, and notes that the primary site is intestinal CYP3A4, with effects returning to baseline after about a week (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2782080/">Herb–Drug Interactions with St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum): an Update on Clinical Observations</a>).</li>
					<li>This induction is particularly relevant for drugs like digoxin, where a 33.3% decrease in trough concentration and 25% reduction in area under the curve (AUC) have been observed after 10 days of St. John's wort use. Such interactions are crucial for patients, as they can lead to reduced effectiveness of medications like cyclosporine, ethinylestradiol, and others, especially with low hyperforin extracts showing weaker effects.</li>

					<li>Serotonin Receptor Agonism (5-HT Receptors):</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, which is primarily responsible for its psychedelic effects. It also binds to other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT6, with Ki values (binding affinities) lower than 10 μM. The 5-HT2A receptor is critical for hallucinogenic effects, while 5-HT1A binding may modulate emotional and sensory effects.</li>
						<li>Effects: Produces altered perceptions, euphoria, visual hallucinations (primarily closed-eye visuals), increased sensory awareness, and emotional amplification. The head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents, a behavioral proxy for psychedelic effects, is positively correlated with 5-HT2A receptor affinity and negatively correlated with 5-HT1A affinity.</li>
						<li>Timeline:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Onset: &lt;15 minutes (oral administration).</li>
							<li>Peak: ~30 minutes post-administration.</li>
							<li>Duration: 2–4 hours (oral route, based on Shulgin’s reports).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Notes: The psychedelic effects are described as primarily physical (e.g., tingling sensations, body high) with fewer visual distortions compared to other psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Monoamine Reuptake Inhibition:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT inhibits the reuptake of dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT), increasing extracellular levels of these neurotransmitters. This contributes to its euphoric and energizing effects.</li>
						<li>Effects: Enhanced mood, increased energy, and heightened arousal. User reports describe a “sensual” and “energized” body state.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Physiological Effects:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanism: Likely mediated by a combination of serotonin receptor activation and monoamine reuptake inhibition, with possible contributions from adrenergic and histamine receptor binding.</li>
						<li>Effects:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Body High: Described as a sharp, all-encompassing tingling sensation that rises during the onset and peaks at ~30 minutes.</li>
							<li>Cardiovascular Effects: Potential for tachycardia and increased blood pressure, as reported with other synthetic tryptamines.</li>
							<li>Other Effects: Agitation, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control (making walking difficult) have been reported, particularly at higher doses.</li>
							<li>Adverse Effects: Acute delirium and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in rare cases, indicating potential for severe toxicity at high doses or in combination with other substances.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Timeline: Onset within 15 minutes, peaking at 30 minutes, and resolving within 2–4 hours for most effects. Severe adverse effects (e.g., delirium) may persist longer in overdose scenarios.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Half-Life:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Data Availability: There is no direct data on the half-life of 5-MeO-DALT in humans. Based on its short duration of action (2–4 hours), the elimination half-life is likely on the order of 1–2 hours, similar to other short-acting tryptamines like 5-MeO-DMT (half-life ~1 hour) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>).</li>
							<li>Metabolism: 5-MeO-DALT is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) through 6-hydroxylation, O-demethylation, or N-dealkylation, with metabolites conjugated to glucuronide or sulfate. (source <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxytryptamine">1</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxy-n-n-dimethyltryptamine">2</a>)</li>
							<li>Estimation: Assuming similar pharmacokinetics to 5-MeO-DMT, the half-life is likely short, with rapid clearance contributing to the brief duration of effects.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Bioavailability:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Oral Bioavailability: Not explicitly quantified in the literature, but oral administration is effective, suggesting moderate bioavailability. Anecdotal reports indicate that oral doses of 12–25 mg produce effects, while higher oral doses (30–35 mg) of 5-MeO-DMT have low potency due to first-pass metabolism by MAO-A, suggesting 5-MeO-DALT may have better oral bioavailability due to less MAO-A susceptibility. A rough estimate based on related tryptamines (e.g., mitragynine ~21%) suggests oral bioavailability of 20–40%. (source <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxytryptamine">1</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028383/">2</a>)</li>
							<li>Other Routes:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Insufflation (Snorting): Likely higher bioavailability (50–70% estimated, based on 5-MeO-DMT’s intranasal bioavailability), with faster onset (~5–10 minutes). (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>)</li>
								<li>Intravenous: Near 100% bioavailability, but no specific data exists for 5-MeO-DALT.</li>
								<li>Rectal: Potentially higher than oral (40–60% estimated), with faster onset than oral but slower than insufflation.</li>
								<li>Vaporization/Inhalation: High bioavailability (70–90% estimated), with very rapid onset (within minutes). (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source</a>)</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Dosage Information</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Safe Dosage Range:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Minimum Effective Dose: 12 mg (oral), based on Shulgin’s reports and anecdotal data. Lower doses (e.g., 4–10 mg) may produce mild effects but are often subthreshold. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source</a>)</li>
								<li>Typical Recreational Dose: 12–25 mg (oral), producing moderate psychedelic effects with manageable intensity. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source</a>)</li>
								<li>Upper Safe Limit: Up to 25 mg (oral) is generally considered within the safe range for most users, though individual sensitivity varies. Doses up to 50 mg have been reported anecdotally but are associated with increased risk of adverse effects (e.g., agitation, loss of motor control). (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Threshold for Increased Risk: Doses above 25 mg (oral) increase the risk of adverse effects such as agitation, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control. Doses approaching 50 mg are considered high-risk due to potential for delirium and rhabdomyolysis. (<a href="https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/V25VK0QTAA">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
								<li>Context: A reported death involved a user under the influence of 5-MeO-DALT who was hit by a vehicle, suggesting impaired judgment and motor control at higher doses. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source 1</a> and <a href="https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/publications/the-recreational-tryptamine-5-meo-dalt-nn-diallyl-5-methoxytrypta">source 2</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Data Availability: No specific LD50 values are available for 5-MeO-DALT in humans or animals. For comparison, 5-MeO-DMT has an LD50 in mice ranging from 48–278 mg/kg depending on the route of administration. Assuming similar toxicity, the human LD50 for 5-MeO-DALT (for a 70 kg individual) could be estimated at 3,360–19,460 mg (3.36–19.46 g), but this is highly speculative and not directly applicable. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>)</li>
								<li>Dangerous Dose Estimation: Doses above 50 mg (oral) are likely dangerous due to increased risk of severe agitation, hyperthermia, delirium, and rhabdomyolysis. A fatal outcome is more likely from behavioral risks (e.g., accidents due to impaired judgment) than direct pharmacological toxicity, as seen in the reported death case. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>When It Becomes Too Dangerous:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Threshold: Doses ≥50 mg (oral) or equivalent via other routes (e.g., 20–30 mg insufflated) are considered dangerous due to heightened risk of severe physiological and psychological effects. Combining 5-MeO-DALT with MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., harmaline) significantly increases the risk of serotonin toxicity, even at lower doses, due to potentiation of serotonergic effects. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
								<li>Signs of Danger: Agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, delirium, and loss of motor control indicate overdose. Immediate medical attention is required if these occur. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/n-n-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine">source</a>)</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Additional Notes</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Limited Data: The pharmacological profile of 5-MeO-DALT is poorly characterized due to limited human studies and sparse toxicology data. Most information comes from anecdotal reports and rodent studies, which may not fully translate to humans. (<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22683457/">source 2</a>)</li>
							<li>Harm Reduction: Due to the lack of comprehensive safety data, users should start with low doses (e.g., 10–12 mg oral), avoid combinations with other psychoactive substances (especially MAOIs), and ensure a safe environment. Standard drug tests (e.g., urine EIA) do not detect 5-MeO-DALT, complicating clinical management of toxicity.

					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>AMT exhibits a range of pharmacological effects, primarily through its interaction with monoamine systems. It acts as a releasing agent for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, with specific EC50 values indicating potency: serotonin release ranges from 22 to 68 nM, dopamine from 79 to 112 nM, and norepinephrine from 79 to 180 nM. Additionally, AMT is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, with notable activity at the 5-HT2A receptor, showing an EC50 of 23 nM and an Emax of 103%, suggesting strong agonist properties. It also functions as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), with an IC50 of 380 nM, and its potency in rats is comparable to harmaline at 7 μM/kg (1.5 mg/kg harmaline, 1.2 mg/kg AMT). These actions contribute to its stimulant, entactogenic, and psychedelic effects, mediated by increased neurotransmitter availability and receptor activation.</li>
						<li>Metabolites identified in male Wistar rats include 2-Oxo-αMT, 6-hydroxy-αMT, 7-hydroxy-αMT, and 1′-hydroxy-αMT, indicating metabolic pathways involving hydroxylation and conjugation, consistent with tryptamine metabolism.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The pharmacokinetics of AMT are not fully elucidated in the literature. The onset of action is typically 3-4 hours, with effects lasting 12-24 hours, suggesting a prolonged duration that may indicate a long half-life. However, specific half-life data is not available, though the alpha substitution is noted to make AMT a poor substrate for MAO-A, potentially prolonging its presence in the system. Bioavailability, particularly for the oral route, is not quantitatively documented, but its effectiveness when taken orally implies sufficient absorption, supported by predicted high human intestinal absorption (probability 1.0) and blood-brain barrier penetration (probability 0.9856) from ADMET models.</li>
						<li>Metabolic studies in human hepatocytes show slow metabolism, with a 25% decrease in signal intensity after 3 hours, which may explain the prolonged psychedelic effects. Postmortem concentrations in overdose cases range from 2.0 µg/mL to 4.7 µg/mL in blood, with higher levels in urine and bile, but these do not directly translate to pharmacokinetic parameters like half-life or bioavailability.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dosage recommendations vary based on intended effects and user reports. For antidepressant purposes, under the brand name Indopan, doses of 5-10 mg were prescribed. Recreational use for psychedelic effects typically starts at 20-30 mg, with strong effects at 40-60 mg and heavy effects at 60-80 mg. Erowid reports include individuals taking doses as high as 400 mg, though with severe effects, and recommends starting at threshold or light levels (5-25 mg) to avoid dangerously strong reactions, especially for new users or with new batches. The minimum effective dose for psychedelic effects is around 20 mg, while doses above 60 mg are associated with increased risks, including hospitalization, based on unverifiable reports.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Safety and Toxicity</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Safety concerns are significant, particularly at higher doses. Doses exceeding 60 mg have been linked to hospitalization, and there were 22 deaths associated with AMT in England and Wales from 2012 to 2015, though exact doses are not specified. Case reports, such as a fatality in Miami in 2003, involved a 22-year-old college student with postmortem blood concentrations of 2.0 mg/L, but ingested dose is unclear. Another case reported a plasma concentration of 440 µg/L with severe serotoninergic syndrome, indicating potential toxicity at high exposures.</li>
						<li>Animal toxicity data from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) lists an oral LD50 of less than 5 mg/kg, dermal LD50 less than 50 mg/kg, and inhalation LD50 less than 0.5 mg/L/4h, classifying it as Acute Tox. 2, indicating high acute toxicity. However, this animal data seems inconsistent with human use, where doses up to 80 mg (approximately 1.14 mg/kg for a 70 kg person) are reported without immediate fatality, though with significant adverse effects. This discrepancy highlights the need for caution, as individual sensitivity varies widely, and AMT's MAO-A inhibition may increase risks of interactions with tyramine-rich foods or other drugs, potentially leading to hypertensive crises or serotonin syndrome.</li>
						<li>The maximum safe dose without high risks is difficult to determine, but based on reports, it seems likely that doses above 60-80 mg are increasingly dangerous, with potential for severe adverse effects like anxiety, tachycardia, vomiting, and in extreme cases, fatality. The evidence leans toward starting with low doses and having a trusted companion present, given the variability in response.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Time Influence and Risk Assessment</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The influence of AMT's pharmacological actions over time is reflected in its long duration (12-24 hours), which may be due to slow metabolism and prolonged neurotransmitter effects. The onset, taking 3-4 hours, can lead to redosing errors, increasing overdose risk, as effects may take time to fully develop. Risks increase significantly at higher doses, with reports of severe reactions at 40 mg and above, and fatalities associated with use, particularly in polydrug contexts.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Conclusion</li>
					<ul>
						<li>AMT's pharmacological profile includes monoamine release, serotonin receptor agonism, and MAO-A inhibition, with effects lasting 12-24 hours and significant safety concerns at doses above 60 mg. While exact half-life and bioavailability data are lacking, its oral effectiveness is clear. Dosage should start low, with careful monitoring for adverse effects, given the potential for severe toxicity and fatalities at higher exposures. Further research is needed to clarify pharmacokinetics and establish precise LD50 values in humans, given the controversy around animal data and human use patterns.</li>

					<li>Notably, it does not significantly release serotonin or dopamine even at high concentrations (up to 100 μM), suggesting a selective profile focused on norepinephrine systems. This selectivity is derived from in vitro studies, as detailed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NM-2-AI">Wikipedia: NM-2-AI</a>.</li>
					<li>User reports from platforms like Bluelight.org suggest that effects are felt within an hour of oral ingestion, with one report noting effects at 50 mg after one hour, described as mood uplift and clear-headedness. The duration isn't specified, but related compounds and user experiences imply effects may last several hours, aligning with its stimulant nature.</li>
					<li>The half-life, based on animal studies, is estimated at 1-2 hours. This estimation comes from a metabolism study in mice, where blood concentrations decreased from 2.7 µg/mL at 30 minutes to 0.23 µg/mL at 300 minutes, suggesting a half-life around 1.3 hours via rough calculation, consistent with a reported 1-2 hour half-life for its metabolite, 2-AI, in rat brain from a study on MDAI pharmacokinetics (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584616300513">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Dosage recommendations are primarily derived from user reports and online sources like PsychonautWiki, with the following ranges for oral administration:</li>
					<li><ul>
						<li>Threshold: Listed as 5 mg, though user reports suggest 50 mg is often the effective starting dose, indicating potential variability.</li>
						<li>Light: 50-100 mg, where users report positive effects like mood uplift and enhanced reaction times.</li>
						<li>Common: 100-150 mg, noted as a typical range, but with some reports of negative effects like mood depression and irritability.</li>
						<li>Strong: 150-200 mg, potentially increasing intensity but also risks.</li>
						<li>Heavy: Over 200 mg, considered high risk with limited data on safety.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>User reports from Bluelight.org provide additional context:</li>
					<li><ul>
						<li>At 50 mg, effects included uplifted mood, clear head, and improved gaming performance, suggesting this as a minimum effective dose for many.</li>
						<li>At 100-150 mg, some users reported it as a "mood killer," with depressive effects and potential anger, indicating the start of adverse effects.</li>
						<li>Related compound 2-AI reports mention nausea and vomiting at higher doses, which may apply to NM-2-AI at similar levels.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>The safe range and maximum dose without high risks are also unclear due to limited toxicity data. User reports suggest that doses above 100-150 mg may start to become too dangerous, with potential for adverse effects like mood changes and physical symptoms. The minimum effective dose appears to be around 50 mg based on user experiences, aligning with light dose ranges.</li>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/3-Methylmethamphetamine.svg/1200px-3-Methylmethamphetamine.svg.png"></img></li>
					<li>Other name: 3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine.</li>
					<li>3-MMA is an amphetamine derivative, structurally related to methamphetamine but with a methyl group at the 3-position on the phenyl ring and an N-methyl group.</li>
					<li>As an amphetamine derivative, it is expected to act as a monoamine releasing agent, increasing the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and possibly serotonin by interacting with their respective transporters (SERT, NET, DAT).</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Monoamine Release: Research on related compounds, such as 3-Methoxyamphetamine (3-MA), shows EC50 values of 58.0 nM for norepinephrine and 103 nM for dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methoxyamphetamine">source</a>). While 3-MMA is structurally different, it likely shares similar properties, but no specific data exist.</li>
						<li>MAO Inhibition: User discussions on platforms like Bluelight suggest 3-MMA may act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), potentially stronger than amphetamine (affinity 11 µM) but weaker than para-substituted amphetamines like pMTA or pMA (nanomolar range). For comparison, 3-MeOA (a related compound) has an affinity of 23 µM, indicating 3-MMA might be safer than 4-MeOA (pMA, sub-micromolar affinity) (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>). However, these are speculations without scientific validation.</li>
						<li>Receptor Binding: No studies on 3-MMA's receptor binding (e.g., to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, or adrenergic receptors) were found. Related compounds like 3-Methylmethcathinone (3-MMC) show binding to serotonin and adrenergic receptors, but 3-MMA's profile remains unknown (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylmethcathinone">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>There is no detailed pharmacokinetic data for 3-MMA, such as oral bioavailability, half-life, or Tmax. For comparison, related compounds like 3-MMC have an oral bioavailability of 7% and a half-life of 50 minutes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylmethcathinone">source</a>), but these cannot be directly applied to 3-MMA due to structural differences.</li>
					<li><ul>
						<li>Onset and Duration: Oral administration reportedly has an onset around 90 minutes, with peak effects at 2.5 hours and a soft comedown after 4.5 hours. Higher doses (e.g., 50% filled 00 capsule) show quicker serotonin effects, with a total duration of 4.5 hours (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Administration Routes: Insufflation (snorting) causes a burning sensation, with effects noted without a harsh comedown, but exact durations are unclear.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Given the lack of studies, 3-MMA's safety profile is uncertain. User reports highlight potential risks:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Vasoconstriction and Tachycardia: Noted at higher doses, with vein pain reported, suggesting cardiovascular effects similar to other stimulants.</li>
						<li>Neurotoxicity: There is concern about neurotoxicity, especially at high doses, due to MDMA-like serotonin flood stages, but no scientific evidence confirms this.</li>
						<li>Comparison to Related Compounds: Studies on 4-Methylmethamphetamine (4-MMA) suggest minimal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice compared to methamphetamine , but human data for 3-MMA are lacking.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>User reports provide approximate dosing, though without precise measurements:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Insufflation: ~2 cm line (~0.8 inches), burning sensation, no harsh comedown.</li>
						<li>Oral: 00 capsule 25% filled, peak at 2.5 hours, soft comedown after 4.5 hours; higher dose (50% filled) shows quicker serotonin effects.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Effects include clean stimulation, mild tachycardia, blurry vision (similar to high MDMA doses), weaker empathogenic effects, mood lift, and dry mouth, with increased water intake needed. The risk of redosing is noted due to delayed onset, which could exacerbate side effects.</li>
					<li>3-MMA is a positional isomer of schedule I controlled substances in the US (e.g., EtAMP, dimethyl-AMP), making it "born illegal" with unambiguous legal risks (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>). Its status as a designer drug underscores the need for caution, given the lack of regulation and research.</li>

					<li>Homotaurine, also known as Tramiprosate, is a sulfonic acid compound found naturally in seaweed and has been extensively studied for its potential therapeutic effects, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This survey note provides a detailed examination of its pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, dosage regimens, and safety profile, drawing from a wide range of scientific literature and clinical trial data available as of May 29, 2025.</li>
					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<li>Tramiprosate exhibits a multifaceted pharmacological profile, primarily targeting mechanisms implicated in AD pathology. The key actions include:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Inhibition of Amyloid-β (Aβ) Aggregation: Tramiprosate binds to soluble Aβ, particularly at residues Lys16, Lys28, and Asp23, stabilizing monomers and reducing the formation of toxic oligomers and fibrillar plaques. This action is crucial as Aβ aggregation is a hallmark of AD, contributing to neuronal damage. Preclinical studies in transgenic mice have shown reduced plaque burden and decreased CSF Aβ levels, supporting its potential as a disease-modifying agent. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/homotaurine">source</a>)</li>
						<li>GABAergic Activity: Structurally similar to γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), Tramiprosate acts as a functional agonist at GABA-A receptors, which may contribute to its neuroprotective effects. This activity is thought to modulate neuronal excitability and provide protection against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.00614/full">source</a>). It also reduces caspase 3/7 and 9 activities in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, suggesting a GABA-dependent neuroprotective mechanism. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7358344/">source</a>)</li>
						<li>Anti-inflammatory Effects: Clinical studies, particularly in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, have demonstrated reduced levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-18, indicating an anti-inflammatory role (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5724794/">source</a>). This action may mitigate the inflammatory component of AD pathology.</li>
						<li>Neuroprotection: Beyond GABA-dependent pathways, Tramiprosate inhibits Aβ42-induced ERK1/2 activation through a GABA-independent mechanism, further enhancing its neuroprotective profile (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28435985/">source</a>). This dual mechanism suggests broad protective effects against neuronal damage.</li>
						<li>Promotion of Tau Polymerization: Interestingly, Tramiprosate promotes the polymerization of tau into non-toxic aggregates without affecting tau-microtubule binding, potentially reducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another AD hallmark. (<a href="https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1326-2-17">source</a>)</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The time course of these actions is not fully detailed in the literature, but clinical studies indicate that effects on biomarkers like CSF Aβ levels are observable after three months of treatment, suggesting a gradual onset. (<a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/67/10/1757">source</a>)</li>
					<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
					<li>Pharmacokinetic data for Tramiprosate are primarily derived from studies involving its prodrug, ALZ-801, due to its improved pharmacokinetic profile. Key parameters include:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Half-life: Studies with ALZ-801 suggest a half-life for Tramiprosate of approximately 15-18 hours. For instance, a 2025 study reported a terminal phase elimination half-life of about 14.8 hours, while a 2018 study indicated around 18 hours (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-025-01482-8">Clinical Pharmacokinetics: Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Oral ALZ-801</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29063518/">PubMed: Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Safety of ALZ-801</a>).</li>
						<li>Bioavailability: Specific oral bioavailability for Tramiprosate is not directly available, but for ALZ-801, an estimated oral bioavailability of approximately 52% was reported in a 2018 study, suggesting efficient absorption and conversion to active moieties (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5814546/">source</a>). Given ALZ-801's design to improve upon Tramiprosate's pharmacokinetics, the bioavailability of Tramiprosate itself may be lower, but exact figures are lacking.</li>
						<li>Metabolism and Excretion: Tramiprosate is metabolized to 3-sulfopropanoic acid (3-SPA), an endogenous metabolite with anti-Aβ activity, and is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with plasma exposures inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-025-01482-8">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Dosage Regimens</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Range of Doses Tested: Doses in clinical studies ranged from 50 mg to 150 mg twice daily (BID). For example, a phase II study randomized patients to 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg BID for three months, with an open-label extension at 150 mg BID for 17 months (<a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/01.wnl.0000244346.08950.64">source</a>). Phase III trials, such as the Alphase Study, used 100 mg and 150 mg BID for 78 weeks (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3258678/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose appears to be around 100 mg BID, as this dose showed a dose-dependent reduction in CSF Aβ42 levels in phase II studies, suggesting therapeutic activity (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/homotaurine">source</a>). Lower doses like 50 mg BID showed less pronounced effects.</li>
						<li>Maximum Safe Dose: The maximum tested dose in humans is 150 mg BID, which was generally well-tolerated, with adverse events primarily gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, leading to discontinuation in about 3.6% of patients (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7358344/">source</a>). No amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) were observed, indicating a favorable safety profile at this dose.</li>
						<li>LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: Specific LD50 values for Homotaurine are not publicly available in the literature reviewed. Preclinical toxicology data are sparse, with studies focusing more on efficacy and safety in animal models rather than acute toxicity. Given its use in clinical trials at doses up to 150 mg BID without serious adverse events, it is considered safe at therapeutic levels, but higher doses have not been tested in humans, making the toxicity threshold unclear (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.00614/full">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Safety Profile</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Common Adverse Effects: The most frequent adverse events are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, which are dose-dependent but not significantly different from placebo at 100 mg BID (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3258678/">source</a>). Syncope was also reported in some cases.</li>
						<li>Mortality and Serious Events: In the Alphase Study, mortality rates were 4.0% for placebo, 2.8% for 100 mg BID, and 2.3% for 150 mg BID, with no significant difference, suggesting no increased risk at therapeutic doses (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7358344/">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Subgroup Safety: APOE4 carriers, particularly homozygotes, showed a similar safety profile, with no increased incidence of vasogenic edema compared to non-carriers (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29199323/">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Given the lack of LD50 data and the focus on chronic safety in elderly patients, the point at which Tramiprosate becomes dangerously toxic is not established, but clinical data suggest it remains safe within the tested range of 50-150 mg BID.</li>

					<li>Agonist at the NMDA-glycine site.</li>
					<li>Is a glucogenic amino acid, meaning it can be converted into glucose in the liver through gluconeogenesis.</li>
					<li>L-alanine is released from muscle tissues during protein breakdown and transported to the liver, where it undergoes transamination via alanine transaminase (ALT), producing pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted into glucose, contributing to blood glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia, especially in glucose-dependent tissues like the brain and red blood cells.</li>
					<li>Care must be taken, as it can be harmful if blood sugar is already normal or high, necessitating careful monitoring.</li>
					<li>It serves as an energy source for muscles and the central nervous system.</li>
					<li>It is often used in combination with other amino acids, such as in alanine-glutamine dipeptides, to enhance solubility and stability in nutritional solutions.</li>
					<li>An unexpected and less commonly discussed aspect is the pharmacological action of D-alanine, the enantiomer of L-alanine. D-alanine is a selective and potent agonist at the NMDA-glycine site, a receptor involved in excitatory neurotransmission. Research has shown it improves cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenia, particularly when used alongside antipsychotics, with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/alanine">small randomized controlled trial (n=22)</a> demonstrating benefits without significant side effects (Alanine).</li>
					<li>Alanine also has structural roles in proteins, with 31 residues in the I2S structure, and mutations at alanine sites can lead to disease phenotypes. For example, mutations like p.Ala68Glu, p.Ala85Ser, and p.Ala205Thr are associated with severe or attenuated phenotypes, depending on their location (mid-helix or buried positions) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/alanine">Studie</a>).</li>

					<li>Used to prevent and treat cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus. It works by competing with arginine, an amino acid the virus needs to replicate, potentially reducing outbreak frequency and severity.</li>
					<li>It may affect serotonin and GABA receptors, reducing cortisol levels and improving stress-induced anxiety, particularly in populations with low dietary lysine intake.</li>
					<li>Lysine enhances calcium absorption in the gut and reduces its loss in urine, which could help maintain bone health and prevent osteoporosis.</li>
					<li>Some research indicates Lysine may lower blood pressure and prevent arterial calcification, especially in conditions like uremia. However, the evidence is not yet robust, and more studies are needed to confirm these cardiovascular benefits.</li>

					<li>Aspartic acid, particularly the L-form, is thought to act as a neurotransmitter, exciting neurons in the brain.</li>
					<li>While less common, D-aspartic acid is used as a dietary supplement and may influence hormone levels, such as increasing testosterone. This is more of a supplement claim and not a standard pharmacological use, with mixed research results.</li>
					<li>Is non-essential, as the body can synthesize it from oxaloacetate and glutamate, particularly in the liver and muscles (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10536334/">Aspartic Acid in Health and Disease</a>).</li>
					<li>Research suggests that aspartic acid, particularly L-aspartic acid, acts as a potent neuronal excitant, activating the same receptors as glutamic acid.</li>
					<li>The excitatory nature of aspartic acid can contribute to excitotoxicity under pathological conditions, where excessive activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors may lead to brain injury. This is managed by Na+-dependent transport mechanisms to clear EAAs, highlighting the importance of its transport in limiting potential neurotoxicity (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/aspartic-acid">Aspartic Acid - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics</a>).</li>
					<li>It is particularly important in maintaining intracellular NAD(H) redox balance via the malate-aspartate shuttle and facilitating amino acid metabolism (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10536334/">Aspartic Acid in Health and Disease</a>).</li>
					<li>D-aspartic acid, distinct from L-aspartic acid, has been studied for its potential pharmacology actions in hormone regulation, particularly testosterone. It is naturally found in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and testes, and is often used as a dietary supplement to increase testosterone and growth hormone levels, potentially improving sexual potency and athletic performance (<a href="https://examine.com/supplements/d-aspartic-acid/">D-Aspartic Acid benefits, dosage, and side effects</a>).</li>

					<li>Research suggests Proline supports connective tissue health, especially skin and joints, through collagen synthesis.</li>

					<li>The quality of Proline supplements is also a consideration, with a study assessing seven dietary supplements finding content variability (73–121% in capsules, 103–156% in tablets) and detecting five contaminants, emphasizing the need for quality control (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9958592/">Dietary Supplements with Proline—A Comprehensive Assessment of Their Quality | PMC</a>).</li>
					<li>Proline’s most prominent pharmacological action is its role in collagen synthesis, where it constitutes a significant portion of the glycine-proline-hydroxyproline triplets forming the triple-helical structure of collagens. Clinically, this translates to its use in addressing conditions requiring tissue repair, such as arthritis or post-surgical recovery (<a href="https://www.xtend-life.com/blogs/supplement-ingredients/l-proline">L-Proline | Health Benefits and Uses of L-Proline | Xtendlife</a>).</li>
					<li>Proline is involved in several metabolic pathways, notably arginine and proline metabolism, which are crucial for energy production and amino acid interconversion. It is a substrate for Proline dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial (PRODH), which converts Proline to delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a step in its catabolism. This enzyme’s activity is linked to cell proliferation and tumor development, suggesting Proline’s role in metabolic stress responses, particularly in cancer cells (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/proline-dehydrogenase">Proline Dehydrogenase - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics</a>).</li>
					<li>At the molecular level, Proline binds to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (e.g., PPIB, PPIA), enzymes that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, influencing protein folding and conformation. This action is significant for structural proteins like collagen. Additionally, Proline inhibits monocarboxylate transporter 10 (SLC16A10), which transports thyroid hormones and aromatic acids, potentially affecting hormonal and metabolic regulation (<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00172">Proline: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online</a>).</li>
					<li>A study on CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells demonstrated that L-Proline induces depolarization, primarily via postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation, leading to multiple orthodromic population spikes and potential depolarization block. This action suggests neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic potential, with implications for conditions like hyperprolinemia, where elevated Proline levels may contribute to seizures and mental retardation (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001429999290580W">NMDA receptor-mediated depolarizing action of proline on CA1 pyramidal cells | ScienceDirect</a>). </li>
					<li>Additionally, defects in neural Proline transport, mediated by transporters like SLC6A7 (PROT1) and SLC6A19 (B0AT1), are associated with ataxia and psychosis. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A7 has been shown to reduce locomotor activity and improve learning and memory in mice, highlighting Proline’s role in cognitive and motor functions (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.728576/full">Frontiers | The Multifaceted Roles of Proline in Cell Behavior</a>).</li>
					<li>Proline’s role in pathology is notable, particularly in parasitic infections. For instance, in Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas disease), Proline is essential for survival under oxidative and thermal stress, and inhibiting its uptake is explored as a novel drug target, with studies developing transporter inhibitors to reduce parasite proliferation (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2020.00696/full">Frontiers | Targeting L-Proline Uptake as New Strategy for Anti-chagas Drug Development</a>).</li>
					<li>In cancer, increased Proline metabolism is observed in metastatic cell lines, correlating with invasiveness and resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting its role in tumor progression (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/proline-dehydrogenase">Proline Dehydrogenase - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics</a>).</li>

					<li><h2>Pharmacological Actions of L-Serine</h2></li>
					<li>L-serine exhibits a range of pharmacological actions, primarily centered on the nervous system and immune function:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Neuroprotective Effects:</b> L-serine is crucial for protecting neurons from damage. It mitigates neurotoxicity through the activation of glycine receptors and upregulation of PPAR-γ, a nuclear receptor involved in inflammation and metabolism. This action helps reduce neuronal damage in conditions like stroke and neurodegenerative diseases (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Anti-inflammatory Effects:</b> It reduces neuroinflammation by downregulating the proliferation of microglia and astrocytes, which are immune cells in the brain, and decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. This anti-inflammatory property is vital for managing conditions like multiple sclerosis and brain injuries (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Neurotransmitter Synthesis:</b> L-serine serves as a precursor to glycine and D-serine, which are essential for excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. This process is critical for long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity, underpinning learning and memory. Its role in neurotransmitter synthesis makes it a potential target for cognitive enhancement (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Immune Modulation:</b> Through mTOR signaling, L-serine supports the proliferation and function of immune cells, such as natural killer cells (enhancing IFN-γ production) and neutrophils (supporting IL-17/IL-22 production). This immunomodulatory effect could be beneficial in conditions requiring immune support, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Circadian Rhythm Regulation:</b> L-serine influences the circadian clock, particularly through its effects on the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the brain's master clock. This action may regulate sleep-wake cycles, offering potential benefits for insomnia and related disorders (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/serine">Serine - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Metabolic Roles:</b> Beyond neurological effects, L-serine is involved in one-carbon metabolism, providing intermediates for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions. It is also a building block for phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids, critical components of cell membranes. These roles suggest potential impacts on metabolic disorders like diabetes and steatohepatitis, though more research is needed (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471489221001326">Dietary serine supplementation: Friend or foe? - ScienceDirect</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><h2>Pharmacological Actions of D-Serine</h2></li>
					<li>D-serine, derived from L-serine via serine racemase, has distinct pharmacological actions, primarily in the nervous system:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>NMDA Receptor Co-agonist:</b> D-serine acts as a co-agonist at the glycine site of NMDA receptors, which are crucial for excitatory neurotransmission. This action is vital for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, making D-serine a target for cognitive and psychiatric research (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/serine">Serine - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Therapeutic Potential in Schizophrenia:</b> D-serine is being studied for its role in improving symptoms of schizophrenia when used alongside standard antipsychotic therapy. It enhances NMDA receptor function, potentially alleviating negative symptoms, though it is less effective when used alone (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1615/serine">SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews</a>).</li>
						<li><b>Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease:</b> Recent studies suggest D-serine levels in cerebrospinal fluid may serve as a biomarker for early Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, highlighting its role in neurodegenerative processes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine">Serine - Wikipedia</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><h2>Therapeutic Uses and Clinical Applications</h2></li>
					<li>Both forms of serine are under investigation for various therapeutic uses, with L-serine showing broader application:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>L-Serine Therapeutic Uses:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1 (HSAN1):</b> Supplementation at 400 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks reduced neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids, improving neurological outcomes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
							<li><b>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):</b> A phase I trial demonstrated safety, with no contribution to disease progression rate, and a phase II trial is planned (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
							<li><b>Severe Encephalopathy (GRIN2B-related):</b> Improved motor, cognitive performance, and communication after 11 and 17 months at doses like 500 mg/kg/day in pediatric cases (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
							<li><b>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD):</b> Rescued cognitive deficits in AD mouse models, outperforming D-cycloserine in passive avoidance tests, suggesting potential for human trials (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
							<li><b>Investigational Uses:</b> Ongoing research for Parkinson’s Disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, driven by its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10452085/">L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential</a>).</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li><h2>Safety Profile and Dosage Considerations</h2></li>
					<li>The safety of serine supplementation varies by form and dose:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>L-Serine Safety:</b> Commonly consumed in foods, with a typical dietary intake of 3.5-8 grams daily. It is possibly safe at higher doses, up to 25 grams daily for up to 1 year, with side effects like upset stomach and bloating. Very high doses (25 grams or more daily) may lead to increased stomach issues and seizures, making it possibly unsafe (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1615/serine">SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews</a>).</li>
						<li><b>D-Serine Safety:</b> Doses of 2-4 grams daily for up to 4 weeks have been used safely, but higher doses (8 grams or more daily) may increase the risk of side effects, similar to L-serine (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1615/serine">SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Affected Receptors and Actions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The main targets are the transporters for serotonin (SERT), noradrenaline (NET), and dopamine (DAT). These are not traditional receptors but proteins that manage neurotransmitter levels. St. John's wort likely inhibits these transporters, preventing them from removing the neurotransmitters from the brain's communication spaces, thus increasing their availability.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Affinities</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The binding strength, measured as IC50 values, is based on hyperforin, a key active compound in St. John's wort. Research suggests:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Serotonin transporter: IC50 around 2.5 nM</li>
							<li>Noradrenaline transporter: IC50 around 10 nM</li>
							<li>Dopamine transporter: IC50 around 100 nM</li>
						</ul>
						<li>These values indicate how much of the compound is needed to block half of the transporter's activity, with lower numbers showing stronger binding.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Additional Pharmacological Considerations</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>While the primary focus is on neurotransmitter transporters, St. John's wort's pharmacology extends beyond these targets. For instance, it is a potent activator of the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR), leading to the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (notably CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein, which are crucial for drug metabolism and can result in significant herb-drug interactions (<a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.14936">Clinical relevance of St. John's wort drug interactions revisited - Nicolussi - 2020 - British Journal of Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Additionally, other components like hypericin have been studied for antiviral and antibacterial properties, and there is some evidence suggesting interactions with GABA(A) receptors, though these are less central to its antidepressant effects (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11827764_In_vitro_binding_studies_with_two_Hypericum_perforatum_extracts_-_Hyperforin_hypericin_and_biapigenin_-_On_5-HT6_5-HT7_GABAAbenzodiazepine_sigma_NPY-Y1Y2_receptors_and_dopamine_transporters">In vitro binding studies with two Hypericum perforatum extracts - Hyperforin, hypericin and biapigenin - On 5-HT6, 5-HT7, GABAA/benzodiazepine, ... | ResearchGate</a>). Hyperforin has also been shown to activate transient receptor potential canonical C6 (TRPC6) channels, which may have roles in other physiological processes, but their relevance to depression is not well-established (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295217300370">Hyperforin activates gene transcription involving transient receptor potential C6 channels - ScienceDirect</a>).</li>

					<li>When given by oral gavage, plasma NMN levels show a steep increase within 2.5 minutes, peak at 5-10 minutes, and then decline to baseline, suggesting a half-life on the order of minutes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7238909/">The Science Behind NMN–A Stable, Reliable NAD+Activator and Anti-Aging Molecule</a>).</li>
					<li>This rapid decline is attributed to immediate utilization for NAD+ biosynthesis, leading to marked increases in tissue NAD+ levels (2-3-fold in liver over 60 minutes) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842119/">NAD+ intermediates: The biology and therapeutic potential of NMN and NR</a>).</li>
					<li>In humans, specific half-life data is scarce, but clinical trials suggest similar rapid metabolism. For instance, a study administering 250 mg/day NMN found no significant increase in blood NMN concentration, while higher doses (1000-2000 mg/day) showed dose-dependent increases, indicating that at lower doses, NMN is quickly converted and not detectable in plasma (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457723001249">Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) intake increases plasma NMN and insulin levels in healthy subjects</a>).</li>
					<li>This supports the notion of a short half-life, likely less than an hour, due to rapid conversion to NAD+ and its metabolites, such as N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, which were measured in some trials (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31685720/">Effect of oral administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide on clinical parameters and nicotinamide metabolite levels in healthy Japanese men</a>).</li>
					<li>The short half-life has implications for dosing regimens, with recommendations for split doses throughout the day to maintain NAD+ levels, as seen in product guidelines suggesting morning and afternoon intake due to NMN's rapid clearance (<a href="https://doublewoodsupplements.com/products/nicotinamide-mononucleotide">Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) Supplement | Double Wood Supplement</a>).</li>
					<li>However, the exact half-life remains poorly characterized in humans, with ongoing research needed to establish precise pharmacokinetic parameters, especially given the variability in absorption and metabolism across individuals (<a href="https://www.nmn.com/news/pharmacokinetics-the-missing-metric-to-determine-dosage">Pharmacokinetics: The Missing Metric to Determine Dosage</a>).</li>
					<li>Clinical trials, such as a 60-day study with doses up to 900 mg/day, have shown NMN to be safe with no significant adverse effects, increasing blood NAD+ levels dose-dependently, with optimal efficacy at 600 mg/day (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9735188/">The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial</a>).</li>
					<li>However, the FDA has classified NMN as an investigational drug since late 2022, limiting its availability as a supplement in the U.S., which underscores the need for further safety and efficacy studies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide">Nicotinamide mononucleotide - Wikipedia</a>).</li>
					<li>Besides oral ingestion, NMN can be taken sublingually (under the tongue) or via nasal spray, both bypassing the digestive system for potentially higher bioavailability. Sublingual supplements and nasal sprays are available and marketed for enhanced absorption.</li>
					<li>A daily dose of 250 mg NMN for 12 weeks significantly increased NAD+ levels in healthy subjects, suggesting high bioavailability.</li>
					<li>Given the lack of specific data, it seems likely that taking NMN on an empty stomach is preferable for optimal absorption, but this is based on general principles rather than conclusive evidence. The evidence leans toward empty stomach for potentially better results, but further research is needed to quantify the difference.</li>
					<li>Sublingual NMN involves placing the supplement under the tongue, where it dissolves and is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes, bypassing the digestive system.</li>
					<li>A source from NOVOS (<a href="https://novoslabs.com/frequently-asked-questions/nmn-nicotinamide-mononucleotide/can-you-take-nmn-orally-or-only-sublingually/">Can you take NMN orally? Or only sublingually?</a>) confirms that NMN can be taken orally or sublingually, with recent research showing good absorption by mouth, but sublingual administration is often preferred for bypassing the GI tract.</li>

					<li>Increased Blood NAD+ Levels:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 80 healthy middle-aged adults (aged 40–65 years) demonstrated that NMN supplementation at doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg daily for 60 days significantly increased blood NAD+ concentrations compared to placebo and baseline. Specifically, the 900 mg group saw an increase from 10.5 ± 6.8 nM to 48.5 ± 19.8 nM at day 60, indicating a substantial boost in NAD+ levels [1]. This enhancement is crucial for cellular function and is a primary mechanism for NMN's effects.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Improved Physical Performance:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>In the same trial, physical performance was assessed using the six-minute walking test. Participants receiving 900 mg NMN daily showed a significant increase in walking distance from 323 ± 113 meters at baseline to 480 ± 128 meters at day 60. This represents an approximate 48.6% increase ((480 - 323) / 323 * 100%), highlighting NMN's potential to enhance physical capabilities, particularly in middle-aged adults [1].</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Stabilized Biological Age:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The trial also measured blood biological age using the Aging.Ai 3.0 calculator. While the placebo group's biological age increased significantly by day 60 (from 39.8 ± 7.2 years to 45.4 ± 8.2 years), NMN-treated groups showed no significant change. For instance, the 300 mg group went from 42.2 ± 6.0 to 43.7 ± 6.7 years (p = 0.46), suggesting NMN may help maintain biological age, a key anti-aging indicator [1].</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in 25 postmenopausal women with prediabetes and overweight or obesity (BMI 25.3 to 39.1 kg/m²) found that 250 mg/day of NMN increased muscle insulin sensitivity by 25 ± 7%. This was measured via insulin-stimulated glucose disposal using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, with no change in the placebo group. This improvement is clinically relevant, comparable to effects seen after 10% weight loss or certain diabetes treatments [2].</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Weight Reduction and Metabolic Health:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A study involving middle-aged and older overweight or obese adults (aged 45+ years) taking 2,000 mg/day of NMN (MIB-626 formulation) for 28 days showed a significant body weight reduction of 1.9 kg (95% CI: -3.3 to -0.5, p=0.008). Additionally, total cholesterol decreased by 26.89 mg/dL (95% CI: -44.34 to -9.44, p=0.004), LDL cholesterol by 18.73 mg/dL (95% CI: -31.85 to -5.60, p=0.007), and diastolic blood pressure by 7.01 mmHg (95% CI: -13.44 to -0.59, p=0.034), indicating broad metabolic benefits [3].</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Improved General Health Assessment:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The SF-36 survey, measuring subjective general health, showed significant improvements in NMN-treated groups compared to placebo at day 60 in the first trial. For example, the 900 mg group improved from 122 ± 17 at baseline to 140 ± 11 at day 60, suggesting better overall health perception [1].</li>

					<li>Biochemical Link Between NAD+ and Testosterone</li>
					<ul>
						<li>NAD+ plays a vital role in steroidogenesis, the process of hormone synthesis, by supporting enzymes like 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, which is essential for converting precursors into testosterone. A review article, "Regulation of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ⁵-Δ⁴ isomerase: a review" , highlights that this enzyme requires NAD+ as a cofactor, suggesting that declining NAD+ levels could theoretically impair testosterone production. However, in young individuals with presumably sufficient NAD+, the impact might be negligible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Animal Studies: Insights from Boars and Mice</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Animal studies provide the most direct evidence on NMN's effect on testosterone. A study on Landrace boars, "Supplementing Boar Diet with Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Improves Sperm Quality Probably through the Activation of the SIRT3 Signaling Pathway" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11117624/">source</a>), found that NMN supplementation (at doses of 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks) significantly increased serum testosterone levels (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that in adult male pigs, NMN enhances testosterone, contradicting the idea of lowering it. The study design involved 32 boars, with serum samples analyzed for testosterone, showing increased levels in supplemented groups compared to controls, as detailed in Figure 2D of the article.</li>
						<li>Contrastingly, a mouse study, "Low NAD+ Levels Are Associated With a Decline of Spermatogenesis in Transgenic ANDY and Aging Mice" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9120959/">source</a>), investigated NAD+ deficiency and found no significant impact on testicular testosterone levels. This study used transgenic ANDY mice, where NAD+ levels were experimentally lowered, and measured testosterone via radioimmuno-assays and LC-MS/MS, with results indicating no suppression in testosterone synthesis despite NAD+ deficiency (see Figure 4A and 4B). This suggests that within a certain range, testosterone production may not be sensitive to NAD+ levels, at least in mice.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Human Studies: Limited Evidence</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Human clinical trials on NMN have primarily focused on safety, NAD+ levels, and outcomes like muscle function, without directly measuring testosterone. For instance, "Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9158788/">source</a>) involved 65 men over 65, administering 250 mg/day NMN for 12 weeks, and reported improvements in gait speed and grip strength, with no adverse effects. However, testosterone was not measured, limiting direct applicability.</li>
						<li>Another trial, "The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9735188/">source</a>), included 80 middle-aged adults (40-65 years) with doses of 300, 600, or 900 mg/day for 60 days, focusing on NAD+ levels and physical performance, again without testosterone data. These studies suggest NMN is safe and well-tolerated, but do not address testosterone effects, especially in younger populations.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Understanding Downregulation</li>
					<ul>
						<li>NAD+ biosynthesis involves multiple pathways, with the salvage pathway being predominant in mammals, mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which converts nicotinamide (a byproduct of NAD+ consumption) to NMN, subsequently converted to NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). Research highlights a feedback loop involving NAD+, SIRT1 (a NAD+-dependent deacetylase), and NAMPT, regulated by circadian rhythms. Specifically, the circadian clock machinery (CLOCK–BMAL1) upregulates NAMPT, increasing NAD+ levels, which in turn activates SIRT1. High SIRT1 activity can suppress CLOCK:BMAL1, reducing NAMPT expression, thus forming a negative feedback loop to maintain NAD+ homeostasis.</li>
						<li>This loop suggests that elevated NAD+ levels from NMN supplementation could lead to reduced NAMPT expression, potentially downregulating endogenous NAD+ production via the salvage pathway. However, NMN supplementation bypasses NAMPT by directly providing NMN, which is converted to NAD+ by NMNATs, potentially mitigating the impact of reduced NAMPT activity.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Evidence from Clinical and Preclinical Studies</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Current research, primarily from short-term human trials and longer-term animal studies, provides insights into the effects of NMN supplementation. A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy middle-aged adults showed that NMN (250 mg/day) significantly increased NAD+ and metabolite concentrations without adverse effects, suggesting no immediate downregulation issues (<a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05614-9">source</a>).</li>
						<li>In animals, long-term studies (e.g., 1-year administration in mice at 100–300 mg/kg/day) showed NMN was safe, improved insulin sensitivity, and caused no significant side effects, with no evidence of downregulation affecting efficacy (<a href="https://www.elysiumhealth.com/blogs/aging101/benefits-of-nmn">source</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Potential Risks and Theoretical Concerns</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Despite these findings, theoretical risks exist. High NAD+ levels from NMN could enhance SIRT1 activity, potentially suppressing NAMPT expression via the feedback loop, reducing endogenous NAD+ production. However, since NMN supplementation directly provides the precursor, this might not significantly impact overall NAD+ levels during supplementation. Long-term effects remain uncertain, with concerns about potential adaptation, such as reduced activity of other NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes or increased degradation by enzymes like CD38, though no human studies have confirmed this.</li>
						<li>Another concern is the accumulation of nicotinamide, a byproduct of NAD+ consumption, which at high concentrations (1–5 mM) can inhibit NAD+-dependent enzymes like sirtuins and PARPs, potentially affecting feedback regulation (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123221001491">source</a>). However, clinical trials have not observed significant adverse effects, suggesting these risks are minimal at current doses.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Safety Profile and Long-Term Considerations</li>
					<ul>
						<li>NMN has been tested in doses up to 1,250 mg/day in humans without significant adverse effects, with studies up to 24 weeks showing safety (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/supplements/nicotinamide-mononucleotide/">source</a>). The lack of long-term human studies means potential downregulation risks over extended periods are not fully understood, though animal data suggest no major issues.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Comparative Analysis: NMN vs. Other NAD+ Precursors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Compared to nicotinamide riboside (NR), another NAD+ precursor, NMN shows similar benefits but with different metabolic fates. NR also increases NAD+ levels, with some studies noting increased LDL cholesterol and fatty liver risks at high doses, but no specific downregulation concerns (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123221001491">source</a>). Both precursors seem to bypass significant downregulation, with efficacy maintained in trials.</li>

					<li>Research suggests that Threonine supplementation enhances hepatic lipid metabolism, reducing the risk of fat accumulation in the liver, which can lead to conditions like hepatic steatosis.</li>
					<li>Threonine deficiency can induce hepatic triglyceride accumulation, while supplementation exerts a protective effect by regulating lipogenesis signaling pathways and thermogenic gene expression. For example, a study on obese mice showed that Threonine supplementation restored decreased UCP1 expression, highlighting its potential in managing lipid metabolic disorders.</li>
					<li>Supplementing a Threonine-deficient diet in rats reduced liver fat accumulation, supporting the notion that adequate Threonine levels are crucial for preventing fatty liver (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/189917a0">Prevention of Fatty Liver due to Threonine Deficiency by Moderate Caloric Restriction | Nature</a>).</li>
					<li>Threonine's role in protein synthesis is fundamental, given its status as an essential amino acid. It is a building block for proteins, notably collagen, elastin, and enamel protein, which are critical for the structural integrity of connective tissues. This is evident from sources like Dr. Axe, which detail Threonine's involvement in forming the foundation of bones, muscles, and skin (<a href="https://draxe.com/nutrition/threonine/">Threonine Benefits, Uses, Foods, Supplements and Side Effects - Dr. Axe</a>). The PMC review further elaborates that Threonine is required for synthesizing Threonine-rich proteins like mucins, with 71% of total Threonine usage in piglets dedicated to mucosal protein synthesis, underscoring its importance in tissue repair and maintenance.</li>
					<li>Threonine's impact on intestinal health is another significant pharmacological action, with high intestinal extraction rates (40–60% of dietary intake) used for mucosal protein synthesis and oxidation. The PMC article provides detailed insights, noting that Threonine maintains mucosa integrity, enhances villus height, and affects digestive enzyme synthesis, with specific demands like 11% of total protein for amylase synthesis in broilers. It also plays a role in gut microbiota, reducing pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli while increasing beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus, as seen in studies with dietary Threonine levels 26% above NRC recommendations.</li>
					<li>Moreover, Threonine supports immune function within the gut, comprising 7–11% of IgA and modulating cytokine expression via pathways like MAPK and TOR. For instance, it up-regulates IL-6 in piglets and affects mRNA expression of immune-related genes, suggesting a role in enhancing gastrointestinal immune responses (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8399342/">Physiological Functions of Threonine in Animals: Beyond Nutrition Metabolism</a>).</li>
					<li>Threonine serves as a precursor to other amino acids, notably glycine and serine, which have their own physiological roles. This is highlighted in DrugBank, where it is noted that Threonine is changed in the body to glycine, potentially reducing muscle contractions, though evidence for clinical benefits is limited (<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00156">DrugBank Online: Threonine</a>). The Wikipedia entry also mentions its use in synthesizing glycine for L-carnitine production in the brain and liver, particularly in rats, indicating a broader metabolic role (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine">Threonine - Wikipedia</a>).</li>
					<li>While there is interest in Threonine's potential for neurological conditions like ALS and multiple sclerosis, current evidence does not strongly support its effectiveness. WebMD notes that taking Threonine by mouth does not slow ALS progression or reduce symptoms, and there is insufficient reliable information for other uses, suggesting a need for further research (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1083/threonine">WebMD: Threonine</a>).</li>
					<li>An unexpected detail is Threonine's role in cell proliferation and epigenetic regulation, particularly in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The PMC review details that Threonine is necessary for the undifferentiated state and proliferation of mouse ESCs, with TDH mRNA levels 1000 times higher in ESCs than in differentiated cells. It also participates in histone methylation via Thr catabolism, maintaining the pluripotent state by affecting H3K4 di- and trimethylation, which could have implications for regenerative medicine and tissue repair.</li>

					<li>Cystine’s main pharmacological action is as a precursor for Cysteine, which helps produce glutathione, a key antioxidant. This can protect cells from damage, potentially aiding skin conditions where oxidative stress is a factor.</li>
					<li>Cystine, the oxidized dimer of the amino acid Cysteine, is a sulfur-containing compound with significant biochemical and potential pharmacological roles, particularly in dermatology and cellular health.</li>
					<li>Cystine is formed by the oxidation of two Cysteine molecules, linked by a disulfide bond. This process is reversible, as Cystine can be converted back to Cysteine through reduction, typically by the addition of hydrogen. This interconversion is crucial, as Cysteine is a precursor for glutathione, a tripeptide (glutamate, cysteine, glycine) known for its antioxidant properties. Glutathione helps neutralize free radicals, protecting cells from oxidative damage, which is particularly relevant in skin health and conditions like acne, where oxidative stress is implicated.</li>
					<li>Cystine serves as a major precursor for glutathione synthesis</li>
					<li>Cystine interacts with the cystine-glutamate antiporter (system xc-), a sodium-independent transporter that exchanges extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. This system is critical for maintaining cellular redox balance, as it provides cystine for glutathione synthesis and regulates glutamate levels.</li>
					<li>Cystine is a component of keratin, a structural protein found in high quantities in hair (constituting about 5% of human hair) and nails.</li>
					<li>Its deficiency has been shown to slow skin and hair growth, suggesting a role in maintaining tissue integrity.</li>
					<li>In skin lightening, a randomized controlled trial found that oral supplementation of L-Cystine with reduced L-Glutathione significantly lightened dark spots, suggesting a synergistic effect.</li>

					<li>It seems likely that Amantadine acts as a PDE1 inhibitor, which may increase cyclic AMP levels and contribute to its neuroprotective effects.</li>
					<li>Studies indicate Amantadine increases AADC expression, enhancing dopamine synthesis from L-DOPA, which is crucial for its antiparkinsonian effects.</li>
					<li>Amantadine is known to block dopamine reuptake, increasing extracellular dopamine levels, which helps in managing Parkinson’s symptoms.</li>
					<li>The evidence leans toward Amantadine indirectly interacting with D2 receptors by raising dopamine levels, though it doesn’t directly bind to them, affecting receptor activity.</li>
					<li>Research suggests Amantadine stimulates noradrenergic responses, potentially enhancing noradrenaline release, which may contribute to its effects on mood and fatigue.</li>
					<li>It appears Amantadine has immunomodulatory effects, reducing T lymphocytes and altering cytokine levels, which could be relevant in conditions like multiple sclerosis.</li>
					<li>Beyond the listed terms, Amantadine also shows effects like NMDA receptor antagonism, acting as a sigma-1 receptor agonist, and modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, among others, expanding its therapeutic potential.</li>
					<li>Amantadine is identified as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, particularly affecting PDE1, with an IC50 of approximately 5 μM, potentially increasing cyclic AMP levels. This action may contribute to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, as noted in studies like Kakkar et al. (1997) and Sancesario et al. (2014). This effect is significant in neurological conditions, where PDE1 inhibition can modulate cAMP signaling, potentially reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesias.</li>
					<li>Research, including a 1998 study by Hsu et al., demonstrates that Amantadine increases AADC mRNA in PC12 cells at concentrations of 10 and 100 μM, enhancing the enzyme’s activity by up to 27% in human striatum imaging studies. This increase is crucial for dopamine synthesis from L-DOPA, supporting its role in Parkinson’s disease therapy, as seen in studies like those by UCL Discovery.</li>
					<li>Amantadine’s ability to block dopamine reuptake is well-documented, with studies showing it increases extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum, an effect attenuated by coadministration of nomifensine, a known dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This action, detailed in research by Mizoguchi et al. (1994), enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, aiding in symptom management for Parkinson’s and depression-like conditions.</li>
					<li>While Amantadine does not directly bind to D2 receptors, it indirectly interacts with them by increasing dopamine levels, which can enhance D2 receptor activity. This is supported by studies like Moresco et al. (2002), which observed increased [11C-]raclopride binding, indicating higher D2 receptor availability, likely due to elevated dopamine. This indirect effect is part of its dopaminergic actions, as noted in Wikipedia and ScienceDirect overviews.</li>
					<li>Amantadine’s noradrenergic effects include stimulating norepinephrine release, as evidenced by studies like Farnebo et al. (1971), which suggest it enhances noradrenergic transmission. This action is part of its broader neurotransmitter modulation, potentially contributing to its antidepressant and fatigue-reducing effects in conditions like multiple sclerosis, as seen in reviews by PMC.</li>
					<li>Amantadine exhibits immunomodulatory effects, reducing T lymphocytes and altering cytokine levels (e.g., IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ), as shown in studies on multiple sclerosis patients by Clark et al. (1989) and Wandinger et al. (1999). This action is particularly relevant in neuroinflammatory conditions, with evidence from ScienceDirect indicating its anti-inflammatory function.</li>
					<li>NMDA Receptor Antagonism: Amantadine acts as a weak, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, stabilizing channel closure and reducing glutamatergic excitotoxicity, as detailed in Blanpied et al. (2005).</li>
					<li>Sigma-1 Receptor Agonist: It binds to and activates sigma-1 receptors, potentially contributing to neuroprotection, as noted in DrugBank and Wikipedia overviews.</li>
					<li>Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Negative Allosteric Modulator: Amantadine modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting cholinergic signaling, which may play a role in its side effect profile and therapeutic actions.</li>
					<li>Induction of GDNF Expression: Studies like Caumont et al. (2006) report that Amantadine induces glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression in astroglia, supporting neuronal survival and potentially aiding in neurodegenerative disease management.</li>
					<li>Antiviral Action: Its inhibition of the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus prevents viral replication, though resistance has limited its use, as noted in MedlinePlus.</li>
					<li>Possible Weak 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonist: Some research suggests weak antagonistic effects at 5-HT3 receptors, potentially contributing to its effects on nausea and mood, though this is less studied.</li>
					<li>Blockade of Certain Ion Channels: Amantadine blocks ion channels like those encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Protein E, ORF10), and studies on viral potassium channels suggest it affects channel function, as seen in PMC articles.</li>

					<li><h2>Neurotransmitter and Brain Function</h2></li>
					<li>Glycine is known to function as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, particularly in the spinal cord, where it helps calm nerve activity. This action might help reduce muscle spasms. Additionally, glycine interacts with NMDA receptors in the brain, which are involved in learning and memory, and this interaction is being studied for potential benefits in treating schizophrenia, especially for symptoms like social withdrawal.</li>
					<li><h2>Therapeutic Uses</h2></li>
					<li>In medical settings, glycine is used as part of total parenteral nutrition, providing essential nutrients for patients who can’t eat normally. It’s also used as an irrigation solution during certain surgeries, like prostate procedures, due to its non-hemolytic properties. Emerging research suggests glycine may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be helpful in conditions involving inflammation, though more studies are needed.</li>
					<li><h2>Unexpected Detail: Stroke Recovery Controversy</h2></li>
					<li>An unexpected finding is the mixed evidence on glycine’s role in stroke recovery. Some studies suggest it can protect brain cells after an ischemic stroke, potentially improving outcomes, while others indicate high glycine intake might increase stroke mortality risk in certain groups, highlighting a need for careful consideration.</li>
					<li><h2>Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Glycine’s Pharmacology Actions</h2></li>
					<li>Glycine, a simple non-essential amino acid, plays a multifaceted role in pharmacology, extending beyond its basic function as a protein building block.</li>
					<li><h2>Neurotransmitter Actions</h2></li>
					<li>Glycine is recognized as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, primarily in the brainstem and spinal cord. It binds to strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, which are part of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and include a chloride channel. This binding increases chloride conductance, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and inhibition of activity, which may contribute to its potential antispastic effects. For instance, interference with glycine release, as seen in Clostridium tetani infections, can cause spastic paralysis due to uninhibited muscle contraction, underscoring its role in motor control.</li>
					<li>Additionally, glycine interacts with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex at a strychnine-insensitive site, acting as a co-agonist. This modulation enhances NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, which is crucial for excitatory signaling in the brain. This property has been explored in psychiatric contexts, particularly for schizophrenia, where supplemental glycine, when taken with some antipsychotic drugs, has shown potential in reducing negative symptoms like social withdrawal in patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. However, the evidence is mixed, with some studies showing no benefit with newer medications like clozapine.</li>
					<li><h2>Therapeutic Uses and Clinical Applications</h2></li>
					<li>In clinical pharmacology, glycine is utilized in several practical applications. It is a common component of total parenteral nutrition, providing essential amino acids for patients unable to consume food orally, supporting metabolic needs.</li>
					<li>Another significant use is as a 1.5% irrigation solution during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), valued for its non-hemolytic properties, though excessive absorption can lead to complications like TUR syndrome, characterized by neurologic symptoms.</li>
					<li>Emerging research suggests glycine has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially beneficial in conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and various inflammatory disorders. For example, studies indicate glycine can decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve insulin response, possibly through modulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression.</li>
					<li>These effects are thought to involve glycine’s interaction with neutrophils, reducing oxidant production and protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury, as seen in animal models.</li>
					<li><h2>Sleep and Neurological Functions</h2></li>
					<li>Glycine has also been studied for its impact on sleep quality and neurological functions. Research suggests that longer-term administration can improve sleep in healthy populations, potentially by altering body temperature and circadian rhythms, though studies often have small sample sizes and high risk of bias.</li>
					<li>Its role in enhancing neurological functions, such as memory and mood, is linked to its involvement in serotonin production and nerve signal transmission, though evidence is still developing.</li>
					<li><h2>Stroke Recovery: A Controversial Area</h2></li>
					<li>An area of particular interest and controversy is glycine’s role in stroke recovery, specifically in ischemic stroke. Some studies suggest neuroprotective effects, with glycine treatment reducing infarct volume, improving neurologic function scores, and decreasing neuronal and microglial death. For instance, a 2000 trial in Cerebrovasc Dis found that doses of 1.0-2.0 g/day improved outcomes on scales like the Orgogozo Stroke Scale and Barthel Index, potentially through reducing glutamate levels and increasing GABA concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid.</li>
					<li>Another study from 2019 highlighted glycine’s ability to inhibit M1 microglial polarization via the NF-κB p65/Hif-1α pathway, suggesting anti-inflammatory benefits in stroke.</li>
					<li>However, contrasting evidence exists, particularly from dietary intake studies. A 2015 study in the Journal of Nutrition found that high glycine intake was associated with increased risk of mortality from ischemic stroke in men without hypertension, with hazard ratios suggesting a potential risk.</li>
					<li><h2>Precursor Role and Metabolic Contributions</h2></li>
					<li>Beyond its direct actions, glycine serves as a precursor for several key metabolites, including glutathione, creatine, heme, purines, and porphyrins. Its role in glutathione synthesis is particularly notable, as glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that protects cells against oxidative stress, potentially reducing inflammation and supporting aging-related health.</li>
					<li>Creatine, another derivative, is vital for muscle energy, and glycine’s contribution here is explored in athletic supplements.</li>
					<li><h2>Safety and Considerations</h2></li>
					<li>While glycine is generally considered safe, its safety profile, especially at high doses, requires further study. Some reports note mild sedation as a side effect, and caution is advised for use in young children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with liver or kidney disease.</li>
					<li>The quality of glycine supplements varies, and users are encouraged to choose independently tested products and consult healthcare providers.</li>

					<li><b>Precursor to Histamine:</b> Histidine turns into histamine, a chemical that helps with immune responses (like allergies), stomach acid production, and brain functions like wakefulness.</li>
					<li><b>Metal Ion Chelation:</b> Histidine can bind to metals like iron and copper, which is important for enzyme activity and protecting against metal-related damage.</li>
					<li><b>Antioxidant Activity:</b> It fights off harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage, especially through a derivative called carnosine.</li>
					<li><b>Part of Active Peptides:</b> Histidine is found in peptides like carnosine, which help with muscle pH balance and have antioxidant effects.</li>
					<li>Research suggests Histidine might help with conditions like metabolic syndrome, heart diseases, and inflammation, but these areas are still being studied, so we don’t have definitive answers yet.</li>
					<li>An unexpected detail is that it’s used in solutions for organ preservation, which is not something most people associate with amino acids.</li>
					<li>Histidine (HIS) is one of the nine essential amino acids that humans must obtain from their diet, found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and beans. Its unique imidazole side chain, with pKa values around physiological pH, gives it distinctive chemical properties, making it a versatile player in biological systems.</li>
					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Precursor to Histamine</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Histidine is decarboxylated by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase to form histamine, a critical mediator in multiple systems.</li>
							<li><b>Immune Response:</b> Histamine is involved in allergic reactions, released from basophils and mast cells, causing symptoms like itching, swelling, and increased vascular permeability. It is treatable with antihistamines for conditions such as urticaria, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, and in severe cases like anaphylaxis, epinephrine is used.</li>
							<li><b>Gastric Acid Secretion:</b> Histamine binds to H2 receptors on parietal cells, triggering hydrochloric acid release via proton pump activation, essential for digestion.</li>
							<li><b>Neurotransmission:</b> In the brain, histamine modulates appetite, wakefulness, and emotions, with dysregulation linked to conditions like Tourette Syndrome, where mutations in the histidine decarboxylase gene and H3 receptor activity are implicated.</li>
							<li>No reported allergic reactions or peptic ulcers have been associated with increased Histidine intake, suggesting safety in typical supplementation.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Precursor to Histamine</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The imidazole ring of Histidine, with pKa values of 6.2 and 6.5 for free L-HIS, 7.0 in carnosine, and 7.1 in anserine, acts as an effective pH buffer near physiological conditions.</li>
							<li>This property is clinically utilized in organ preservation solutions, such as the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution, containing 198 mM Histidine, and in myocardial protection during cardiac surgery, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular pH during stress.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Metal Ion Chelation</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Histidine forms complexes with metal ions such as Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺, binding iron in haemoglobin and myoglobin, and is present in metalloenzymes like carbonic anhydrase and cytochromes.</li>
							<li>This chelation is crucial for enzyme function and protects against metal-induced neurotoxicity, with carnosine (CAR) specifically noted for protecting against copper- and zinc-induced damage.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Antioxidant Activity</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Histidine mediates antioxidant effects through metal chelation, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and sequestering advanced glycation end products (AGE) and lipoxidation end products (ALE).</li>
							<li>Carnosine is particularly effective, more so than free Histidine, in combating oxidative stress, with studies showing protective roles in conditions like chronic kidney disease and diabetes.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Component of Biologically Active Peptides</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Histidine is integral to histidine-rich proteins (e.g., haemoproteins, histatins, histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, filaggrin) and dipeptides like carnosine and homocarnosine.</li>
							<li>These peptides have specific functions: carnosine maintains pH buffering in muscle tissue, combating intramuscular acidosis, and exhibits antibacterial activity, while histatins contribute to immunity.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Therapeutic Potential and Clinical Studies</li>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Metabolic Syndrome and Inflammation:</b> A 2013 study improved insulin resistance in obese women with metabolic syndrome by suppressing inflammation. Another 2014 study alleviated inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet-induced obese rats via NF-κB- and PPARγ-involved pathways.</li>
							<li><b>Cardiovascular Protection:</b> Histidine prevented brain infarction in postischemic rats (2005 study) and, in combination with vitamin C, protected against isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction in rats (2016). It also mitigated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats when combined with N-acetylcysteine (2014).</li>
							<li><b>Diabetes and Oxidative Stress:</b> A 2005 study delayed diabetic deterioration in mice and protected human low-density lipoprotein against oxidation and glycation, while a 2018 study highlighted its protective role against oxidative stress in anemia of chronic kidney disease.</li>
							<li><b>Inflammatory Bowel Disease:</b> A 2009 study ameliorated murine colitis by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.</li>

					<li><b>Neurotransmitter Role:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Glutamic acid is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to various glutamate receptors, including ionotropic receptors (e.g., NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs).</li>
						<li>Activation of these receptors facilitates neuronal communication by increasing the influx of cations (like calcium and sodium) into neurons, leading to depolarization and signal transmission.</li>
						<li>This excitatory action is essential for learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. However, excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, a process implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and stroke-related brain damage.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Excitotoxicity and Neuroprotection:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>In pharmacological contexts, glutamic acid's overactivation of receptors (especially NMDA receptors) can cause excessive calcium influx, triggering neuronal injury or death. This is a key mechanism in conditions like epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and ischemia.</li>
						<li>Drugs targeting glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine) are used to mitigate excitotoxicity in such conditions.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Metabolic Functions:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Glutamic acid is a precursor to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, via the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This conversion is pharmacologically significant in treatments for anxiety, seizures, and other disorders where GABA modulation is beneficial (e.g., with drugs like benzodiazepines indirectly enhancing GABA activity).</li>
						<li>It also participates in the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant, which protects cells from oxidative stress—a property exploited in therapies for liver disease and neurodegenerative conditions.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Role in Protein Synthesis:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>As an amino acid, glutamic acid is incorporated into proteins, influencing cellular structure and function. Pharmacologically, this is relevant in nutritional supplements or therapies aimed at muscle repair or metabolic support.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Gastrointestinal and Taste Effects:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Glutamic acid, often in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG), stimulates umami taste receptors. While not a direct pharmacological action, this property is used in studies of appetite regulation and sensory pharmacology.</li>
						<li>In the gut, glutamate signaling via receptors may influence digestion and nutrient absorption, an emerging area of pharmacological research.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Acid-Base Balance:</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Glutamic acid contributes to ammonia detoxification in the liver by forming glutamine, a process critical in managing metabolic acidosis or hyperammonemia (e.g., in hepatic encephalopathy). Pharmacological agents enhancing this pathway are sometimes explored in such conditions.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Agonists/Antagonists:</b> Drugs targeting glutamate receptors (e.g., ketamine, an NMDA antagonist) are used in anesthesia, depression treatment, and chronic pain management.</li>
					<li><b>Neurological Disorders:</b> Modulation of glutamatergic activity is a focus in epilepsy (e.g., lamotrigine reduces glutamate release), multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia research.</li>
					<li><b>Nutritional Pharmacology:</b> Glutamic acid supplementation is studied for its potential in muscle recovery and immune function, though evidence is mixed.</li>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Oxiracetam.svg/120px-Oxiracetam.svg.png"></img></li>
					<li>Oxiracetam is generally considered safe at doses up to 2,400 mg, with few side effects reported.</li>
					<li>It enhances the release and uptake of acetylcholine.</li>
					<li>While its primary effects are on acetylcholine and glutamate, there is some indication it may influence dopamine and serotonin to a lesser extent.</li>
					<li>Oxiracetam exhibits neuroprotective effects, protecting neurons from oxidative stress and excitotoxicity.</li>
					<li>Studies in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion show it decreases neuronal degeneration and white matter lesions, particularly at doses of 100-200 mg/kg, with significant reductions in the hippocampus and cortex.</li>
					<li>Inhibits astrocyte activation.</li>
					<li>Increases cerebral blood flow.</li>
					<li>In animal studies, doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg significantly increased cerebral blood flow, with statistical significance (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively).</li>
					<li>Increases ATP synthesis.</li>
					<li>In the acute phase post-cerebral hypoperfusion, it decreases abnormal accumulation of glucose and citric acid while increasing levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, and GMP in the cortex.</li>
					<li>enhances antioxidant levels, such as glutathione and ascorbic acid, with significant increases observed (P &lt; 0.01 for glutathione, P &lt; 0.001 for ascorbic acid with (S)-oxiracetam).</li>
					<li>When administered systemically to rats at 200 mg/kg orally or 100 mg/kg intra-arterially, it is found unmetabolized, with the highest amounts in the septum, followed by the hippocampus, and smaller amounts in the cerebral cortex and striatum. Its distribution pattern is similar when administered directly into the lateral ventricles, indicating its tropism is independent of the administration route.</li>
					<li>Estimated brain amounts range from 1.9 to 19 nmols/rat, delivered via cannula in conscious, freely moving rats, highlighting its effective brain penetration.</li>
					<li>Oxiracetam demonstrates specific therapeutic effects, such as dose-dependently antagonizing scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats, which is indicative of its ability to counteract cholinergic deficits.</li>
					<li>The (S)-enantiomer is identified as the active ingredient, showing higher absorption rates and slower elimination compared to the racemic mixture, and it induces long-term synaptic potentiation in rat hippocampal slices, further supporting its cognitive-enhancing potential.</li>
					<li>Oxiracetam is generally considered safe, with studies reporting no significant side effects at single and repeated oral dosages up to 2,400 mg.</li>

					<li>Also known as 1-propanoyl-lysergic acid diethylamide (1-propionyl-LSD).</li>
					<li>Psychoactive substance related to LSD.</li>
					<li>Thought to work by turning into LSD in the body, leading to similar effects.</li>
					<li>1P-LSD is quickly changed into LSD after you take it, whether by mouth or injection. Studies show it’s almost fully converted, with LSD detectable in blood and urine soon after.</li>
					<li>1P-LSD’s effects are mainly due to LSD.</li>
					<li>Mainly affects serotonin receptors, especially the 5-HT2A type, which is key for the mind-altering effects like hallucinations and altered perception.</li>
					<li>Interacts with other serotonin and dopamine receptors, but these are less understood for 1P-LSD specifically.</li>
					<li>Can boost brain plasticity, potentially helping with memory and neural growth, similar to LSD.</li>
					<li>It seems likely that 1P-LSD is not addictive, with no signs of compulsive use or withdrawal.</li>
					<li>Tolerance builds quickly, meaning repeated use within a short time reduces its effects, resetting after a few days without use.</li>
					<li>Theoretical risk of heart issues due to effects on 5-HT2B receptors.</li>
					<li>Effects last around 7–12 hours, similar to LSD.</li>
					<li>Blood half-life of about 6.4 hours for 1P-LSD.</li>
					<li>Almost fully absorbed when taken by mouth, and LSD can be detected in urine for up to 80 hours.</li>
					<li>A study published in <a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dta.2821">Drug Testing and Analysis</a> in 2020  found that after oral or intravenous administration of 100 μg 1P-LSD hemitartrate (equivalent to 71.2 μg LSD base), 1P-LSD was detectable in serum for up to 4.16 hours, after which it was completely converted to LSD. This conversion was confirmed by detecting LSD in all serum samples, with the last sampling after approximately 24 hours, and in urine for up to 80 hours. The bioavailability of LSD after oral ingestion of 1P-LSD was close to 100%, indicating efficient conversion.</li>
					<li>LSD (and thus 1P-LSD) binds with high affinity to most serotonin receptors except 5-HT3 and 5-HT4, affecting 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT6 at recreational doses. Specific affinity values include:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>5-HT1A: 0.64 – 7.3 nM</li>
						<li>5-HT2A: 0.47 – 21 nM</li>
						<li>5-HT2B: 0.98 – 30 nM</li>
						<li>5-HT2C: 1.1 – 48 nM</li>
					</ul>
					<li>It also shows significant affinity for dopamine receptors, with Ki values such as D1: 155–340 nM and D2: 61–126 nM, though these are lower than for serotonin receptors.</li>
					<li>The conversion of 1P-LSD to LSD leads to increased glutamate release in the cerebral cortex, specifically in layer V, enhancing excitation.</li>
					<li>1P-LSD, like LSD, exhibits significant tachyphylaxis, with tolerance developing almost immediately after ingestion, as noted in PsychonautWiki. Tolerance is reduced to half after 5–7 days and returns to baseline after 14 days without further consumption. There is cross-tolerance with other psychedelics, such as mescaline and psilocybin.</li>
					<li>While 1P-LSD itself shows 38% the potency of LSD in mice, as per PsychonautWiki, its effects are primarily due to conversion to LSD.</li>
					<li>The elimination half-life for 1P-LSD is approximately 6.4 hours, while for LSD, it is about 5.7 hours, as per the PubMed entry.</li>
					<li>1P-LSD is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 enzymes, with the major metabolite being LSD.</li>
					<li>Given its prodrug nature, 1P-LSD’s pharmacological actions mirror those of LSD, with differences primarily in pharmacokinetics, such as rate of absorption and duration.</li>

					<li>Also known as desmetramadol and O-desmethyltramadol.</li>
					<li>Key component of the pain medication tramadol.</li>
					<li>Known for its strong pain-relieving effects.</li>
					<li>Works primarily by mimicking natural painkillers in the body.</li>
					<li>Influences other systems to help manage pain, especially in complex cases.</li>
					<li>Mainly activates μ-opioid receptors.</li>
					<li>Much stronger than tramadol, with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/o-desmethyltramadol">studies</a> showing it’s 2–4 times more potent.</li>
					<li>Block the reuptake of norepinephrine, particularly with the (-)-enantiomer.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.01680/full">Research</a> indicates it may cause fewer breathing issues compared to other strong painkillers.</li>
					<li>For people with kidney problems, O-DSMT can build up, increasing risks like seizures or breathing difficulties, so doctors often lower the dose.</li>
					<li>It's the primary active metabolite of tramadol.</li>
					<li>O-DSMT is formed through the demethylation of tramadol by the liver enzyme CYP2D6, a process analogous to the metabolism of codeine to morphine.</li>
					<li>As of May 7, 2025, O-DSMT is not approved for medicinal use in any country but is significant in research and has been noted as a designer drug due to its unscheduled status in some jurisdictions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmetramadol">source</a>).</li>
					<li>The (+)-enantiomer is identified as a G-protein biased full agonist, which means it preferentially activates the G-protein signaling pathway over the β-arrestin pathway. This bias is significant as it may reduce adverse effects like respiratory depression, a major concern with opioids.</li>
					<li>Up to 200 times greater affinity for μ-opioid receptor than tramadol.</li>
					<li>Also shows far lower affinity for δ- and κ-opioid receptors.</li>
					<li>Both enantiomers are inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, distinguishing it from tramadol, which has dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties (<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-Desmethyltramadol">source</a>).</li>

					<li>Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can significantly impact its efficacy and safety.</li>
					<li>CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience reduced analgesia, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may face increased risks of side effects like respiratory depression and death due to higher O-DSMT levels (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8262591/">source</a>).</li>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Galantamine.svg/250px-Galantamine.svg.png"></img></li>
					<li>Galantamine has a dual approach:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It stops an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine, letting more of this memory-boosting chemical stay active in the brain.</li>
						<li>It also enhances the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are like switches that help acetylcholine work better, potentially improving communication between brain cells.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Galantamine may protect brain cells from damage by acting as an antioxidant and reducing inflammation.</li>
					<li>Tertiary alkaloid drug.</li>
					<li>Reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This enzyme typically hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter critical for memory, thinking, and reasoning, into choline and acetate. By inhibiting AChE, Galantamine increases the concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission. This action is particularly relevant in AD, where cholinergic deficits are a hallmark.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/galantamine">Research</a> indicates Galantamine is 50-fold more selective for AChE over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), with an IC50 for AChE of 0.35 μM and for BuChE of 18.6 μM.</li>
					<li>It has a bioavailability of 80–100%, a protein binding of 18%, and an elimination half-life of 7 hours, with peak AChE inhibition occurring approximately 1 hour after an 8 mg oral dose in healthy volunteers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galantamine">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Acts as a positive allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 and α4β2 subtypes. This means it binds to allosteric sites on these receptors, triggering a conformational change that enhances their response to ACh. At concentrations of 0.1–1 μM, it potentiates agonist responses, while at higher concentrations (>10 μM), it may inhibit activity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK574546/"></a>).</li>
					<li>Exhibits significant neuroprotective properties. It acts as an antioxidant, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting neurons from oxidative damage (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/galantamine">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Prevents the activation of microglia and astrocytes, key players in neuroinflammation, and counters the expression of inflammatory markers such as NF-κB, p65, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/galantamine">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Increases the levels of glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and GABA.</li>
					<li>Stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through nicotine receptors, increasing phosphorylation of Akt and CREB, and reducing the expression of FoXO1, MuRF-1, and atrogin-1. This enhances the release of acetylcholine, ATP, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), potentially supporting muscle function.</li>
					<li>It stimulates proliferation in the hippocampus subgranular zone via M1 muscarinic receptors and supports cell survival through α7 nAChRs, involving insulin-like growth factor 2.</li>
					<li>Clinical studies have shown Galantamine reduces cocaine use frequency at 8 mg/day and improves sustained attention and response inhibition in cigarette smokers, as well as decreasing alcohol consumption in detoxified individuals.</li>
					<li>The dual mechanism of AChE inhibition and nAChR modulation is central to Galantamine's efficacy in AD. Clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function, with doses ranging from 8–32 mg/day showing benefits over 3–6 months, sustained at 24 mg/day for 12 months.</li>
					<li>Galantamine is well-absorbed, with linear pharmacokinetics and rapid, complete absorption. About 75% is metabolized in the liver via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with key pathways including O-demethylation, N-demethylation, epimerization, and glucuronidation. Within 24 hours, approximately 20% is excreted unchanged in urine.</li>

					<li>Retroanalogue of cholecystokinin-4 (CCK-4).</li>
					<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31626171/">Research</a> indicates GB-115 has significant anxiolytic properties, making it a candidate for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A clinical study involving 31 patients with GAD, diagnosed per ICD-10 (F41.1), determined an effective dose of 6 mg per day. The treatment, administered over 21 days, was associated with a fast onset of anxiolytic effects, beneficial impacts on sleep disturbances, and improvements in autonomic symptoms. Additionally, it favorably altered attention parameters, suggesting cognitive benefits alongside anxiety reduction.</li>
					<li>In preclinical models, GB-115 demonstrated anxiolytic effects in behavioral tests. For instance, in outbred mice, doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg were effective in the open field test, while in inbred BALB/c mice, doses of 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg showed efficacy. In the elevated plus-maze test, a standard measure of anxiety, GB-115 increased the time spent in open arms in outbred rats at 0.5-0.7 mg/kg and in BALB/c mice at 0.1 mg/kg, indicating reduced anxiety-like behavior (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10517-013-2112-6">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Further, a study on pharmaceutical compositions of GB-115 found that a controlled-release formulation (composition 4) increased residence time in the elevated plus-maze open arms at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.01) compared to placebo, highlighting its potential for optimized delivery (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257840206_Anxiolytic_Activity_of_Dipeptide_GB-115_after_Oral_Administration">source</a>).</li>
					<li>GB-115’s impact on cognitive functions is notable, particularly in GAD patients.

In mice with secondary immunodeficiency induced by cyclophosphamide, GB-115 demonstrated activity in restoring immune function, suggesting potential applications in conditions involving immune dysregulation (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10517-008-0153-z">source</a>).</li>
					<li>The anti-inflammatory actions of GB-115 are evident in preclinical models. In studies using ConA- and carrageenan-induced inflammation, intraperitoneal injections at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg reduced inflammatory responses. Notably, at 1 mg/kg, GB-115 alleviated symptoms in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, improving spontaneous locomotor activity, promoting recovery of thymus weight, and reducing edema and neutrophil infiltration in brain tissue. It also suppressed the generation of active oxygen forms by neutrophils, as measured by chemiluminescence, indicating a role in mitigating oxidative stress-related inflammation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22235394/">source</a>).</li>
					<li>GB-115’s interaction with pain pathways is complex, involving opioidergic systems. In mice, it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia in the hot-plate test, an effect that was naloxone-dependent, suggesting involvement with opioid receptors. However, it did not modulate behavior in the tail-flick test, indicating specificity to certain pain modalities, likely supraspinal mechanisms. Further, research suggests GB-115 (4 mg/kg) increases response latency in the hot-plate test in a naloxone-independent manner, while producing a moderate naloxone-reversible effect in the tail-flick test, pointing to spinal-level opioidergic interactions (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10517-007-0219-3">source1</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221738723_Study_of_Anti-Inflammatory_Effects_of_GB-115_a_Glycine-Containing_Retropeptide_Cholecystokinin_Analog">source2</a>).</li>
					<li>The primary mechanism of GB-115 involves antagonism of CCK2 receptors, which are critical in anxiety and pain modulation.</li>
					<li>GB-115 is under investigation in clinical trials for anxiety in neurasthenia and adjustment disorders, suggesting broader applications beyond GAD. Its ability to improve cognitive functions, modulate immune responses, and reduce inflammation positions it as a candidate for conditions involving these systems (<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB19204">source</a>).</li>

					<li>Also known as: GLYX-13</li>
					<li>Tetrapeptide with the amino acid sequence Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH2.</li>
					<li>Rapastinel failed to demonstrate efficacy in phase III clinical trials for MDD, as announced by Allergan on March 6, 2019.</li>
					<li>Positive allosteric modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are critical for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.</li>
					<li>Unlike ketamine, which blocks NMDARs, Rapastinel enhances NMDAR activity through a novel binding domain independent of the glycine coagonist site.</li>
					<li>Acts as a weak coagonist with glutamate, facilitating NMDAR-mediated signal transduction. This mechanism is believed to underlie its potential antidepressant effects by promoting long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhancing synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).</li>
					<li>Detailed pharmacological studies indicate that Rapastinel does not bind to the NMDAR glycine site, with 0% displacement observed at 30 μM, suggesting a high-affinity site near the amino terminal-ligand binding interface. Critical amino acids, such as R392E in NR2A and R393E in NR2B, are essential for its effects, and their mutation abolishes Rapastinel’s activity.</li>
					<li>In preclinical models, Rapastinel’s brain concentrations associated with antidepressant-like efficacy range from 30 to 100 nM.</li>
					<li>A dose of 10 mg/kg results in approximately 30 nM, while 30 mg/kg achieves about 100 nM.</li>
					<li>Pharmacokinetic data show a T_max of approximately 20 minutes and a half-life of about 20 minutes in the extracellular fluid, indicating rapid distribution and clearance.</li>
					<li>Pharmacodynamics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>NMDAR Subtype Modulation: Rapastinel enhances [3H] MK-801 binding in HEK cells expressing NR2A-D subtypes with the following EC50 values:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>NR2A: 9.8 pM</li>
							<li>NR2B: 9.9 nM</li>
							<li>NR2C: 2.2 pM</li>
							<li>NR2D: 1.7 pM</li>
							<ul>
								<li>In comparison, glycine has EC50 values ranging from 100 to 350 nM for these subtypes, highlighting Rapastinel’s higher potency at certain NMDAR subtypes.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Calcium Mobilization: At concentrations of 10 to 300 nM, Rapastinel enhances NMDA-induced calcium influx by approximately 30%. At concentrations ≥1 μM, it inhibits calcium influx by about 25%. The EC50 for NMDA is 2.8 μM, and for D-serine, it is 290 nM, indicating its modulatory effects on calcium signaling pathways.</li>
						<li>Electrophysiological Effects: In rat mPFC slices, 100 nM Rapastinel increases NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and enhances the magnitude of LTP, with the effect being maximal at 100 nM and reduced at 1 μM. It does not affect paired-pulse facilitation or miniature EPSCs, suggesting a postsynaptic action. This enhancement is linked to increased synaptic plasticity, potentially contributing to its antidepressant effects.</li>
						<li>Comparison to Ketamine: Unlike ketamine, which inhibits NMDARs with an IC50 of approximately 1.0 μM and 98% displacement at the MK-801 site, Rapastinel enhances NMDAR activity. Additionally, Rapastinel does not affect presynaptic glutamate release, a mechanism observed with ketamine, further distinguishing its pharmacological profile.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Clinical Trials</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Phase II Trial: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study involved 116 patients with MDD who had not responded to at least one biogenic amine antidepressant. Patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of Rapastinel at 1, 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg or placebo. The results, published by Preskorn et al. in 2015, showed that doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D17) from day 1 to day 7, with an onset of action within 2 hours as assessed by the Bech-6 subscale (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25782764/">source</a>). No psychotomimetic or significant side effects were reported, and the effect was maintained for an average of 7 days.</li>
						<li>Phase III Trials: Despite the promising phase II results, multiple phase III studies failed to demonstrate efficacy. Three trials involving a total of 1,510 patients with MDD who had a partial response to antidepressant therapy were conducted. In two studies totaling 872 patients, participants received weekly IV injections of 450 mg Rapastinel or placebo in addition to their oral antidepressants. A third study with 638 participants included a third treatment arm of 225 mg Rapastinel weekly. The primary endpoint was the change in scores on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline at the end of three weeks. In all three trials, Rapastinel did not significantly differ from placebo, as reported in March 2019 (<a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2019.pp3a5">source</a>). This failure raised questions about its clinical utility, despite earlier promise.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Safety and Tolerability</li>
					<li>In the phase II trial, Rapastinel was well tolerated, with no reports of psychotomimetic effects or other significant side effects, distinguishing it from ketamine, which is known for such side effects. In phase III trials, Rapastinel was also found to be well tolerated, but its lack of efficacy over placebo limited its clinical advancement. Additional studies, such as a randomized trial assessing effects on driving performance, showed that single doses of 900 or 1800 mg did not impair driving compared to placebo, further supporting its safety profile (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8742651/">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Preclinical studies provided insights into Rapastinel’s effects on synaptic plasticity. It increases dendritic spines 24 hours post-treatment in the rat dentate gyrus and layer V of the mPFC, enhances LTP, and reduces long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. It also facilitates metaplasticity processes, differing from NMDA receptor antagonists. The BDNF-TrkB-mTOR signaling pathway in the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray is required for its antidepressant effects, and genetic deletion of GluN2B from excitatory neurons in the mPFC blocks these effects, highlighting cell-type specificity (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/rapastinel">source</a>).</li>

					<li>Other name: CAS 519-02-8.</li>
					<li>Alkaloid extracted from plants such as Sophora flavescens.</li>
					<li>Research suggests the following actions, with mechanisms often involving key signaling pathways:</li>
					<li><ul>
						<li>Anti-cancer Effects: Matrine inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, potentially through pathways like NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin. It arrests the cell cycle at G1/G0 phase and inhibits metastasis, as seen in studies on colorectal and lung cancer cells . For example, it reduced tumor volume in mouse models with inhibition rates of 16.29% and 35.35% (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00588/full">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Anti-inflammatory Effects: It reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α, making it promising for conditions like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies on asthmatic mice showed reduced eosinophils and IgE levels, suggesting modulation of Th2 cytokines (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/matrine">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Anti-microbial Effects: Matrine demonstrates activity against bacteria and viruses, potentially due to its ability to disrupt microbial cell processes, though specific time courses are not detailed.</li>
						<li>Neuroprotective Effects: It may protect against neuronal damage in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, possibly by regulating apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress, as noted in reviews (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.977374/full">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Cardioprotective Effects: Matrine has shown potential in treating myocardial ischemia, likely through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, though exact durations of effect are not specified.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Half-Life: Research suggests a plasma half-life of approximately 10.0 ± 2.8 hours in humans, based on a study involving oral administration of Antitumor B (ATB) tablets containing matrine, with individual variations up to 17.06 hours (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817974/">source</a>). In rats, half-lives are shorter, at 92-142 minutes, indicating species differences.</li>
					<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is low, with rat studies showing 17.1 ± 5.4% at 2 mg/kg, but human data are less clear. The evidence leans toward poor absorption, with efforts to improve it via transdermal routes noted (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874120335704">source</a>). High pre-systemic clearance in humans is suggested, consistent with low exposure levels.</li>
					<li>Clinical Doses: Human studies have used oral doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg matrine in soft gelatin capsules, showing dose-related pharmacokinetics (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817974/">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range is not fully established, but doses up to 400 mg have been used without severe adverse effects in trials. The minimum effective dose varies by condition; for example, in cancer studies, in vitro concentrations of 50-800 mg/L showed effects, with IC50 at 312.53 mg/L for Hep3B cells (<a href="https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/N390W430AC">source</a>).</li>
					<li>Maximum Safe Dose and Danger Threshold: The maximum safe dose is unclear, with reports of toxicity at high concentrations (>140 mg/L in 72 hours causing hepatocyte effects). Given potential hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity, doses exceeding clinical trial levels (e.g., >400 mg) may become dangerous, though exact thresholds are not defined.</li>
					<li>LD50: In mice, the intraperitoneal LD50 is 157.13 mg/kg (95% CI 88.08-280.31 mg/kg), and intravenous LD50 is 72.1 mg/kg (95% CL 68.2-76.5 mg/kg), based on acute toxicity tests (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2088002/">source</a>). Oral LD50 data for humans are not available, but animal data suggest high doses are toxic, with oral LD50 in rats reported as >10000 mg/kg for formulated products, likely not pure matrine.</li>
					<li>Human Toxicity: Potential adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting), hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes), cardiovascular issues (heart rate changes), neurological effects (dizziness, seizures at high doses), allergic reactions (rashes, swelling), and reproductive toxicity (impacts on fertility, fetal development) (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01067/full">source</a>).</li>

				<ul>
					<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/CreatineStructure.png/250px-CreatineStructure.png"></img></li>
					<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Creatine’s primary pharmacological action is to facilitate the recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP through the donation of phosphate groups from phosphocreatine. This process, catalyzed by creatine kinase, is crucial for rapid energy production during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. This mechanism is detailed in sources like Wikipedia: Creatine, which notes its role in ATP recycling, primarily in muscle and brain tissue.</li>
						<li>Beyond energy metabolism, creatine may exhibit additional actions, including acting as a pH buffer during intense exercise, potentially reducing acidosis. Emerging research suggests possible antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and neuroprotective benefits, particularly in conditions like neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, DrugBank: Creatine lists creatine as a ligand for various creatine kinases and a product of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, indicating its involvement in cellular energy pathways. However, these secondary actions are less established and require further investigation, as noted in Metabolic Basis of Creatine in Health and Disease, which discusses potential mechanisms beyond energy metabolism.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Time to Effect and Influence</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The time to observe creatine’s pharmacological effects depends on the dosing strategy and the specific action in question. For its primary role in enhancing muscle performance, the key is saturating muscle creatine stores. A loading phase of 20-25 grams per day, divided into 4-5 doses, for 5-7 days can achieve saturation quickly, with performance benefits often noticeable within a week, as supported by Creatine Loading Phase: Research, Benefits, Safety, and How To. Without loading, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams daily can take approximately 28 days to achieve similar saturation, as noted in Does one dose of creatine supplementation fit all?.</li>
						<li>For brain-related effects, such as improved cognitive function, higher single doses (e.g., 0.35 g/kg, or about 24.5 g for a 70 kg person) have shown benefits during sleep deprivation, as seen in Single dose creatine improves cognitive performance, but long-term supplementation may be needed for sustained effects. The influence of these actions is dose-dependent, with higher doses accelerating the onset but potentially increasing side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Half-Life</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The plasma half-life of creatine is approximately 3 hours, as consistently reported in pharmacokinetic studies. This is evident from Creatine - Wikipedia, which states an elimination half-life of just under 3 hours, requiring frequent dosing to maintain elevated plasma levels. This short half-life pertains to plasma clearance and does not reflect the retention time in muscle stores, which can remain elevated for weeks after supplementation ceases, as muscle creatine turnover is slower.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Bioavailabilities</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Creatine monohydrate, the most common supplement form, is considered to have high oral bioavailability, often cited as nearly 100%. This is based on the understanding that it is either absorbed by tissues or excreted in urine, as noted in Bioavailability, Efficacy, Safety, and Regulatory Status of Creatine. However, exact bioavailability percentages in humans are less frequently reported, with animal studies providing some insight. For instance, a rat study found oral bioavailability of 53% at a low dose (10 mg/kg) and 16% at a high dose (70 mg/kg), suggesting dose-dependent absorption, as detailed in Absolute Oral Bioavailability of Creatine Monohydrate in Rats. Given the lack of direct human data, it’s reasonable to conclude that oral bioavailability is high but may vary with dose and formulation, with creatine monohydrate being the most bioavailable form compared to others like creatine lysinate or ethyl ester.</li>
						<li>Other routes, such as intravenous, are not typically used for supplementation, so bioavailability data for these are limited and not relevant for standard use.</li>

					<li>Background and Context</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Creatine, a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in foods like meat and fish, is synthesized in the body from amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and methionine. It plays a crucial role in energy production, particularly in muscles, by increasing phosphocreatine stores, which help regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during high-intensity exercise. Supplementation, often at doses of 3-5 grams daily after an optional loading phase of 20 grams daily for 5-7 days, is common among athletes and fitness enthusiasts to enhance performance and muscle mass. However, potential negative impacts have been reported, and this section aims to quantify these effects with percentages and explain their pharmacological basis.</li>

					<li>Detailed Analysis of Each Impact</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Gastrointestinal Distress:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Incidence: A comprehensive analysis of 685 clinical trials involving 12,839 creatine users found that 5.51% reported gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, stomach upset, and belching, compared to 4.05% in placebo groups, with no significant difference (p = 0.820) Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. However, a specific study on top-level athletes taking a single 10g dose reported a 56% incidence of diarrhea, significantly higher than the 28.6% in divided doses (2 x 5g) and 35.0% in placebo, indicating dose-dependent effects Gastrointestinal distress after creatine supplementation in athletes: are side effects dose dependent?.</li>
							<li>Pharmacology Action: Creatine, particularly in high doses, can exert an osmotic effect in the gastrointestinal tract, drawing water into the intestines and causing diarrhea. This is more pronounced with single large doses due to rapid absorption and concentration in the gut, potentially irritating the stomach lining and leading to stomach upset or belching.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Weight Gain due to Water Retention:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Incidence: Nearly all users (100%) experience weight gain, typically 1-2 kg, especially during the loading phase (20g/day for 5-7 days). A study found an average increase of 1.7 kg over 4 weeks with high doses (30g initially, then 15g) Creatine monohydrate supplementation on body weight and percent body fat. This effect is consistent across studies, with weight gain primarily due to water retention rather than fat gain.</li>
							<li>Pharmacology Action: Creatine increases phosphocreatine stores in muscles, which draws water into the cells via osmotic pressure, leading to intracellular water retention. This is a direct result of creatine’s role in enhancing cellular hydration, which can be perceived as unwanted weight gain, especially for those not seeking muscle mass increase.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Muscle Cramping/Pain:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Incidence: Approximately 0.5% of creatine users reported muscle cramping or pain, compared to 0.07% in placebo groups, with a marginally significant p-value of 0.085, suggesting no strong evidence of increased risk Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. Anecdotal reports are common, but controlled studies refute a direct link.</li>
							<li>Pharmacology Action: The mechanism is unclear, but potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalances might contribute, though studies show creatine may reduce cramping in certain contexts, such as hemodialysis patients, indicating a protective rather than causative role.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Other Reported Side Effects:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Dehydration, Kidney Damage, Liver Damage, etc.: These are often mentioned anecdotally but lack robust scientific support. The International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand notes that assessments of adverse event reports revealed creatine was rarely mentioned and not associated with significant patterns of adverse events, with no support for increased renal or liver dysfunction International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. A meta-analysis on renal function found no significant alteration in serum creatinine or urea levels, reinforcing safety Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Renal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</li>

					Pramipexole
					<ul>
						<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Pramipexole.svg/250px-Pramipexole.svg.png"></img></li>
						<li>Pharmacological Actions and Timing</li>
						<li>Pramipexole works by mimicking dopamine, primarily targeting D3 receptors, which helps reduce symptoms like tremors in Parkinson's and discomfort in RLS. For RLS, it's typically taken 2-3 hours before bedtime, suggesting effects begin shortly after to last through the night. For Parkinson's, the onset might take longer, often days to weeks, as the body adjusts to the medication.</li>
						<li>Half-Life and Bioavailability</li>
						<li>The half-life is around 8 hours for younger individuals and 12 hours for those over 65, meaning it stays in the system longer in older adults. Oral bioavailability is greater than 90%, showing it's well-absorbed with minimal loss.</li>
						<li>
							Dosage Details
							<ul>
								<li>Starting Doses: For RLS, begin at 0.125 mg once daily; for Parkinson's, start at 0.375 mg/day, split into three doses.</li>
								<li>Maximum Doses: RLS can go up to 0.5-0.75 mg/day, while Parkinson's can reach 4.5 mg/day.</li>
								<li>Safe Range: Stay within these limits to minimize risks, as higher doses increase side effects like hallucinations or impulse control issues.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Pramipexole's Pharmacological Profile</li>
						<li>This detailed survey note provides an in-depth examination of Pramipexole's pharmacological actions, timing, pharmacokinetics, and dosage considerations, based on current medical literature and regulatory documents as of June 20, 2025. Pramipexole, a non-ergot dopamine agonist, is primarily indicated for managing Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), with potential off-label uses in mood disorders.</li>
						<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
						<li>Pramipexole exerts its primary effects through dopamine receptor agonism, with a high affinity for D3 receptors, and also interacts with D2 and D4 subtypes. This action helps alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, by stimulating dopamine receptors in the striatum. For RLS, it modulates dopamine pathways to reduce leg discomfort and the urge to move, particularly at night. Research also suggests potential neuroprotective effects, possibly through antioxidant properties and mitochondrial function modulation, though these are not fully established and require further study (<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00413">source</a>). Common side effects include somnolence, impulse control disorders, and hallucinations, which can impact long-term use.</li>
						<li>Timing of Influence</li>
						<li>The timing of Pramipexole's effects varies by condition. For RLS, it is typically administered 2-3 hours before bedtime, indicating an onset within this timeframe to manage nighttime symptoms, with effects lasting through the night based on its pharmacokinetics (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/pramipexole">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
						<li>Pramipexole exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosage range, achieving steady-state concentrations within 2 days of dosing. The terminal half-life is approximately 8 hours in young healthy volunteers and extends to 12 hours in elderly individuals, reflecting age-related changes in renal clearance (<a href="https://www.rxlist.com/mirapex-drug.htm">source</a>). It is widely distributed, with a volume of distribution around 500 L and low plasma protein binding (15%), and is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine (90%), with renal clearance approximately three times higher than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating active tubular secretion.</li>
						<li>Special Populations</li>
						<li>Clearance is reduced by about 30% in women compared to men, largely due to body weight differences, and decreases with age, with a 40% longer half-life and 30% lower clearance in those over 65, likely due to reduced renal function. In Parkinson's patients, clearance is also about 30% lower compared to healthy elderly, possibly reflecting poorer renal function. For renal impairment, clearance drops significantly: 75% lower in severe impairment (creatinine clearance ~20 mL/min) and 60% lower in moderate impairment (~40 mL/min), correlating with creatinine clearance, with negligible removal by dialysis. Hepatic impairment is not expected to significantly affect elimination, given the drug's renal excretion profile (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pramipexole-oral-route/description/drg-20065603">source</a>).</li>
						<li>Dosage Details</li>
						<li>Dosage regimens are tailored to the condition and patient factors. For Parkinson's disease, treatment begins at 0.375 mg/day, divided into three doses, with increases every 5-7 days, up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day, based on response and tolerability. For RLS, the starting dose is 0.125 mg once daily, 2-3 hours before bedtime, with increments every 4-7 days, typically not exceeding 0.5 mg/day, though some cases may reach 0.75 mg/day. In renal impairment, doses are adjusted: for moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 35-59 mL/min), start at 0.125 mg twice daily, with a maximum of 1.5 mg twice daily; for severe impairment (15-34 mL/min), start at 0.125 mg once daily, with a maximum of 1.5 mg once daily; very severe impairment (&lt;15 mL/min) requires caution, as it is not well-studied (<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/020667s014s017s018lbl.pdf">source</a>).</li>
						<li>The minimum effective dose appears to be around 0.75 mg/day for Parkinson's, based on clinical trial data showing efficacy at this level, while for RLS, the starting dose of 0.125 mg/day is often effective. The maximum dose without high risks aligns with the labeled maxima, as exceeding these increases the likelihood of adverse effects like hallucinations, dyskinesias, and impulse control disorders, which are more pronounced at higher doses.</li>
						<li>Safety and Toxicity</li>
						<li>The safe range is within the labeled doses, up to 4.5 mg/day for Parkinson's and 0.75 mg/day for RLS. The LD50 in rats is reported as >800 mg/kg orally, but human LD50 is not established. Overdose cases, such as one involving 11 mg/day for 2 days, have shown symptoms like increased pulse rate (100-120 beats/minute), nausea, vomiting, confusion, and respiratory depression, managed with supportive care, including gastric lavage and intravenous fluids (<a href="https://www.rxlist.com/mirapex-drug.htm">source</a>). Doses above the recommended maximum are considered too dangerous due to increased risk of serious adverse effects, though the exact threshold varies by individual tolerance and condition.</li>
