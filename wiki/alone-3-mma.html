<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/3-Methylmethamphetamine.svg/1200px-3-Methylmethamphetamine.svg.png"/></li>
<li>Other name: 3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine.</li>
<li>3-MMA is an amphetamine derivative, structurally related to methamphetamine but with a methyl group at the 3-position on the phenyl ring and an N-methyl group.</li>
<li>As an amphetamine derivative, it is expected to act as a monoamine releasing agent, increasing the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and possibly serotonin by interacting with their respective transporters (SERT, NET, DAT).</li>
<ul>
<li>Monoamine Release: Research on related compounds, such as 3-Methoxyamphetamine (3-MA), shows EC50 values of 58.0 nM for norepinephrine and 103 nM for dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methoxyamphetamine">source</a>). While 3-MMA is structurally different, it likely shares similar properties, but no specific data exist.</li>
<li>MAO Inhibition: User discussions on platforms like Bluelight suggest 3-MMA may act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), potentially stronger than amphetamine (affinity 11 µM) but weaker than para-substituted amphetamines like pMTA or pMA (nanomolar range). For comparison, 3-MeOA (a related compound) has an affinity of 23 µM, indicating 3-MMA might be safer than 4-MeOA (pMA, sub-micromolar affinity) (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>). However, these are speculations without scientific validation.</li>
<li>Receptor Binding: No studies on 3-MMA's receptor binding (e.g., to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, or adrenergic receptors) were found. Related compounds like 3-Methylmethcathinone (3-MMC) show binding to serotonin and adrenergic receptors, but 3-MMA's profile remains unknown (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylmethcathinone">source</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>There is no detailed pharmacokinetic data for 3-MMA, such as oral bioavailability, half-life, or Tmax. For comparison, related compounds like 3-MMC have an oral bioavailability of 7% and a half-life of 50 minutes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylmethcathinone">source</a>), but these cannot be directly applied to 3-MMA due to structural differences.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Onset and Duration: Oral administration reportedly has an onset around 90 minutes, with peak effects at 2.5 hours and a soft comedown after 4.5 hours. Higher doses (e.g., 50% filled 00 capsule) show quicker serotonin effects, with a total duration of 4.5 hours (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Administration Routes: Insufflation (snorting) causes a burning sensation, with effects noted without a harsh comedown, but exact durations are unclear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Given the lack of studies, 3-MMA's safety profile is uncertain. User reports highlight potential risks:</li>
<ul>
<li>Vasoconstriction and Tachycardia: Noted at higher doses, with vein pain reported, suggesting cardiovascular effects similar to other stimulants.</li>
<li>Neurotoxicity: There is concern about neurotoxicity, especially at high doses, due to MDMA-like serotonin flood stages, but no scientific evidence confirms this.</li>
<li>Comparison to Related Compounds: Studies on 4-Methylmethamphetamine (4-MMA) suggest minimal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice compared to methamphetamine , but human data for 3-MMA are lacking.</li>
</ul>
<li>User reports provide approximate dosing, though without precise measurements:</li>
<ul>
<li>Insufflation: ~2 cm line (~0.8 inches), burning sensation, no harsh comedown.</li>
<li>Oral: 00 capsule 25% filled, peak at 2.5 hours, soft comedown after 4.5 hours; higher dose (50% filled) shows quicker serotonin effects.</li>
</ul>
<li>Effects include clean stimulation, mild tachycardia, blurry vision (similar to high MDMA doses), weaker empathogenic effects, mood lift, and dry mouth, with increased water intake needed. The risk of redosing is noted due to delayed onset, which could exacerbate side effects.</li>
<li>3-MMA is a positional isomer of schedule I controlled substances in the US (e.g., EtAMP, dimethyl-AMP), making it "born illegal" with unambiguous legal risks (<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/community/threads/3-methylmethamphetamine-3-me-ma.901314/">source</a>). Its status as a designer drug underscores the need for caution, given the lack of regulation and research.</li>
