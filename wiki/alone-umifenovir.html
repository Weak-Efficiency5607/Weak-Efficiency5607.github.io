<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>Umifenovir is a dual direct-acting antiviral and host-targeting agent, primarily utilized for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory viral infections in Russia and China. Its pharmacological actions include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Antiviral Activity: Umifenovir inhibits the fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the host cell membrane, preventing viral entry. This is achieved by interacting with viral glycoproteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA), and the plasma membrane, interfering with clathrin-mediated exocytosis. It is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses, including influenza A and B, SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B and C, and others like Zika virus and Ebola virus, as demonstrated in vitro studies [DrugBank: <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609">https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609</a>, ScienceDirect: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir</a>].</li>
<li>Immunomodulatory Effects: Beyond its antiviral properties, Umifenovir exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system. It stimulates the humoral immune response, induces interferon production, and enhances the phagocytic function of macrophages. These effects contribute to a strengthened immune defense, particularly noted in patients with lower baseline immunity, where improvements in CD4, CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and serum immunoglobulin levels have been observed [NCATS Inxight Drugs: <a href="https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/8CXV4OU367">https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/8CXV4OU367</a>].</li>
</ul>
<li>The onset of these actions is rapid, with pharmacokinetic data indicating peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved within 1.38 hours for a 200 mg dose, suggesting early antiviral and immune-modulating effects [PMC: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3623363/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/</a>].</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetic Parameters</li>
<li>The pharmacokinetic profile of Umifenovir is critical for understanding its clinical utility. Key parameters include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-Life (t₁/₂): The half-life ranges from 15.7 to 21 hours, with a study in healthy male Chinese volunteers reporting 15.7 ± 3.8 hours after a 200 mg oral dose, indicating a relatively slow elimination that supports twice-daily dosing in some regimens [PMC: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3623363/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/</a>, Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir</a>].</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is approximately 40%, meaning 40% of the administered dose is absorbed into systemic circulation, unaffected by food intake. This is consistent across multiple sources, ensuring reliable absorption for oral administration [Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir</a>].</li>
<li>Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax): For a 200 mg dose, Tmax is 1.38 ± 1.11 hours, with variations noted for lower doses (e.g., 1.2 hours for 50 mg, 1.5 hours for 100 mg), reflecting rapid absorption [PMC: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/</a>, Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir</a>].</li>
<li>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Curve (AUC): After a 200 mg oral dose, Cmax is 467 ± 174 ng/mL, and AUC_0-∞ is 2,203 ± 691 ng·h/mL, with linear increases observed with higher doses, supporting dose-dependent pharmacokinetics [PMC: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/</a>].</li>
<li>Metabolism and Excretion: Umifenovir is extensively metabolized, primarily by CYP3A4 and other hepatic enzymes, with 33 metabolites identified. About 40% is excreted unchanged, mainly via bile (38.9%) and minimally through kidneys (0.12%), with 90% eliminated within 24 hours [DrugBank: <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609">https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609</a>].</li>

<ul>
<li>Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose is not explicitly defined in literature, but prophylactic doses (e.g., 200 mg once daily) suggest efficacy at lower levels compared to treatment doses (800 mg/day for adults), indicating a dose-dependent response.</li>
<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Clinical use suggests 800 mg/day (200 mg four times daily) is standard and appears safe, with no significant adverse effects reported at this level. Animal studies support a large therapeutic window, with no pathological changes at doses up to 100 times human therapeutic levels [DrugBank: <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609">https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609</a>].</li>
<li>LD50 and Toxicity: The oral LD50 in mice is 340-400 mg/kg, and in rats, it is &gt;3000 mg/kg, indicating high doses are required for toxicity in animals. No human overdose cases are reported, and allergic reactions are limited to hypersensitivity [Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir</a>, DrugBank: <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609">https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609</a>].</li>
<li>Danger Threshold: Given the high LD50 in animals and lack of reported human overdoses, it seems likely that Umifenovir becomes dangerous only at doses significantly exceeding therapeutic levels, though exact thresholds are not established due to limited human data.</li>
</ul>
<li>Safety and Clinical Considerations</li>
<li>Umifenovir is generally well-tolerated, with a favorable safety profile noted in clinical studies. Side effects are minimal, with sensitization reported in children and rare allergic reactions in hypersensitive individuals. The drug's metabolism by CYP3A4 suggests potential interactions with other medications metabolized by this pathway, though no significant interactions were noted in combined therapy studies [ScienceDirect: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir</a>].</li>
<li>The evidence leans toward Umifenovir having a wide therapeutic index, supported by animal studies showing no pathological changes at high doses and its long-term use in Russia and China without significant safety concerns. However, for precise maximum safe doses and danger thresholds, further human studies are needed, especially given its controversial efficacy in conditions like COVID-19, where higher doses have been suggested but not conclusively proven effective [PMC: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361300/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361300/</a>].</li>
