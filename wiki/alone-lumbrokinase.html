<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>Lumbrokinase exhibits multiple pharmacological effects, primarily centered around its fibrinolytic and antithrombotic properties. The following actions have been identified:</li>
<ul>
<li>Fibrinolytic Activity:</li>
<ul>
<li>Lumbrokinase directly degrades fibrin, the protein mesh in blood clots, and activates the plasminogen system to produce plasmin, which further dissolves clots.</li>
<li>It inhibits Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), enhancing the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), thus amplifying fibrinolytic effects.</li>
<li>Studies, such as <a href="https://synapse.patsnap.com/article/what-is-the-mechanism-of-lumbrokinase">Lumbrokinase Mechanism of Action</a>, confirm its dual action, both direct and indirect, distinguishing it from similar enzymes like nattokinase.</li>
</ul>
<li>Anti-platelet Activity:</li>
<ul>
<li>Research suggests Lumbrokinase inhibits platelet aggregation and function, reducing the likelihood of clot formation. This is supported by studies like <a href="https://townsendletter.com/lumbrokinase-an-enzyme-for-more-than-just-circulatory-health-kwok/">Lumbrokinase and Platelet Function</a>, which highlight its anticoagulation effects.</li>
</ul>
<li>Anti-inflammatory Activity:</li>
<ul>
<li>It inhibits Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, reducing inflammation, particularly in conditions like myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This is detailed in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022282816302346">Lumbrokinase and Myocardial Injury</a>, showing its cardioprotective potential.</li>
</ul>
<li>Inhibition of Fibroblast Migration and Adhesion:</li>
<ul>
<li>Lumbrokinase prevents intra-abdominal adhesion by inhibiting fibroblast migration and adhesive activities via the AP-1/ICAM-1 signaling pathway, as evidenced by <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9851794/">Intra-abdominal Adhesion Study</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>The timing of these actions' influence is not explicitly detailed in studies, with the half-life (discussed below) providing a general indicator of duration. Further research is needed to quantify onset and duration for each action.</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life and Bioavailability</li>
<li>Half-Life:</li>
<ul>
<li>The biological half-life of Lumbrokinase, specifically for the formulation DLBS1033, is approximately 8.6 hours when administered orally, based on a clinical trial in healthy volunteers <a href="https://www.actamedindones.org/index.php/ijim/article/view/600">Clinical Trial on Half-Life</a>. This suggests the enzyme remains active in the body for several hours, supporting its therapeutic use.</li>
</ul>
<li>Bioavailability:</li>
<ul>
<li>Oral absorption is possible, with studies using rat everted gut sacs showing absorption rates of 8.7% at 1.0 mg/ml, 11.5% at 2.0 mg/ml, and 14.7% at 0.5 mg/ml after 2 hours, as measured by fibrinolytic activity <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2869457/">Intestinal Absorption Study</a>. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed absorption into blood, supporting oral efficacy.</li>
<li>Enteric-coated formulations are commonly used to protect Lumbrokinase from stomach acid, enhancing absorption, as noted in <a href="https://biologyinsights.com/lumbrokinase-benefits-health-and-wellness-support/">Lumbrokinase Benefits</a>. However, exact bioavailability percentages in humans are not consistently reported, with estimates suggesting around 10-15% based on ex vivo data.</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage and Administration</li>
<li>Dosage varies depending on the condition and product formulation, often measured in both mass (mg) and activity units (e.g., fibrinolytic units, FU, or lumbrokinase units, LKU):</li>
<ul>
<li>Typical Dosage for Chronic Conditions: 20-60 mg per day, as recommended by products like Boluoke® <a href="https://www.researchednutritionals.com/product/boluoke-lumbrokinase-120-caps/">Boluoke Dosage</a>, taken one to three times daily on an empty stomach.</li>
<li>Higher Doses for Severe Conditions: Up to 120 mg per day, with clinical trials for acute ischemic stroke using 600,000 units three times a day (total 1,800,000 units per day), as seen in <a href="https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06200-4">LUCENT Trial Protocol</a>. The activity per mg varies by product, complicating direct comparisons.</li>
<li>Children: Therapeutic dose is 1 capsule per 8 kg body weight per day, according to manufacturer guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<li>Safety, Toxicity, and Adverse Events</li>
<li>Lumbrokinase is generally considered safe, with a low incidence of adverse events reported in clinical trials:</li>
<ul>
<li>Safety Profile: A large trial involving 1,560 patients reported a 1.92% adverse reaction rate, including 0.58% skin itching, 0.19% skin rash, and 1.15% nausea or diarrhea, with no major hemorrhages <a href="https://canadarna.com/pages/boluoke-faq">Boluoke FAQ</a>.</li>
<li>Common Side Effects: Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, difficulty breathing), and mild headaches, as detailed in <a href="https://synapse.patsnap.com/article/what-are-the-side-effects-of-lumbrokinase">Side Effects Article</a>.</li>
<li>Risks and Contraindications: Increased bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants or in bleeding disorders. Contraindicated in recent surgery, trauma, active internal bleeding, GI ulceration, or high-risk aneurysm. Caution advised for liver/kidney conditions and pregnant/breastfeeding women.</li>
<li>Toxicity and LD50: Specific LD50 data is not available, and toxic doses are not well-defined. The primary concern is excessive bleeding at high doses, particularly in susceptible individuals, with no reported cases of overdose leading to lethality in reviewed studies.</li>
