PRL-8-147 is referenced in scientific literature as a psychotropic agent developed in the 1970s by Dr. Nikolaus Hansl, the same researcher behind the related nootropic compound PRL-8-53. A key piece of evidence comes from a 1977 abstract detailing its pharmacological and toxicological characteristics, presented at the Proceedings of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences and Affiliated Societies. This indicates it was studied as a potential drug with psychoactive properties, though limited details are publicly available.

Multiple online discussions and articles confirm its existence as an unreleased, purportedly more potent successor to PRL-8-53, with its chemical formula reportedly existing only in Hansl's private notes. Hansl synthesized it as part of his ongoing research into memory-enhancing compounds, but it never progressed to widespread testing or commercialization. According to accounts from nootropic communities, Hansl's family possesses a personal stash of the compound along with related documentation stored in his garage after his death.

Further evidence includes mentions in chemistry supplier listings and enthusiast forums, where it's described as a benzoic acid derivative aimed at cognitive enhancement, though its "mythical" status stems from the scarcity of published data beyond initial explorations. Some sources note that while PRL-8-53 has a single human trial from 1978, PRL-8-147 appears to have been tested in rodent models with mixed results on efficacy, but no full human studies are documented. Overall, its existence is supported by archival scientific records and anecdotal reports from those connected to Hansl's work, though it remains largely obscure and unavailable.
