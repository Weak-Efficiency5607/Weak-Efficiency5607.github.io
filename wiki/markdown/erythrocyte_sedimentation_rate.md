There are **no direct physiological links** between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, a non-specific marker of systemic inflammation) and dopamine (a catecholamine neurotransmitter). Connections are mostly **indirect**, arising from shared involvement in certain diseases, immune modulation, and clinical monitoring practices.

### 1. Association via Parkinson's Disease (PD)
Parkinson's disease features degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to dopamine deficiency. Epidemiological studies show an **inverse relationship** between ESR levels (measured years earlier) and PD risk:
- In a large cohort of over 659,000 young men followed for up to 48 years, higher adolescent ESR associated linearly with lower subsequent PD risk (hazard ratio 0.93–0.94 per doubling of ESR, up to ~15 mm/h).
- Higher ESR (indicating greater inflammatory capacity) appeared protective, while lower ESR linked to higher PD risk.
- Proposed explanations include:
  - Premorbid immune hypo-reactivity in individuals who later develop PD (reduced ability to mount inflammatory responses).
  - Neuroinflammation or microglial activation (reflected systemically in ESR) exerting neuroprotective effects via trophic factors, despite PD involving local brain inflammation.
No study shows dopamine levels directly altering ESR or vice versa, but the link ties to dopaminergic pathology.

### 2. Dopamine Receptors on Immune Cells and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Diseases
Dopamine receptors (especially D1-like: DRD1, DRD5; and D2-like) express on lymphocytes, macrophages, and synovial cells. Altered dopaminergic signaling influences inflammation, indirectly affecting ESR (elevated in active autoimmune disease):
- In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — CD4+ T cells and follicular helper T cells overexpress D1-like dopamine receptors, correlating positively with disease activity and ESR. Higher DRD5 expression in these cells associates with higher ESR, suggesting dopaminergic signaling promotes pro-inflammatory T-cell differentiation that contributes to systemic inflammation.
- In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — Dopamine receptors (D1–D5) overexpress in synovial tissue, potentially modulating local inflammation. ESR serves as a standard disease activity marker in RA, though direct correlation with receptor expression remains less explicitly studied.
- Broader context: Peripheral dopamine modulates immune responses (often anti-inflammatory at low doses via D2-like receptors, pro-inflammatory at higher doses via D1-like). Dysregulated dopamine signaling in autoimmune conditions can exacerbate inflammation, elevating ESR.

### 3. Clinical Monitoring of Dopamine Agonist Therapies
Certain dopamine agonists (especially ergot-derived ones like cabergoline or pergolide, used in PD, restless legs syndrome, or hyperprolactinemia) rarely cause fibrotic complications (cardiac valvulopathy, pleural/peritoneal fibrosis). Guidelines recommend regular ESR monitoring because inflammation/fibrosis from these drugs elevates ESR (along with C-reactive protein):
- Elevated ESR supports diagnosis of drug-induced fibrosis and prompts further imaging or discontinuation.
- This represents a practical clinical link (ESR as a safety marker during dopaminergic therapy) rather than a physiological one.

### 4. Other Minor or Exploratory Links
- Some studies measure serum dopamine alongside ESR in contexts like critical illness, COVID-19, or neurotransmitter profiling, occasionally reporting correlations, but these appear coincidental or secondary to disease states rather than causal.
- No convincing evidence exists that dopamine or its metabolites directly alter red blood cell aggregation, plasma viscosity, or fibrinogen levels enough to change ESR in vitro or in vivo under normal conditions.
- Low ESR sometimes associates with conditions involving dopaminergic dysfunction (e.g., exploratory models linking very low ESR to PD features or serum dopamine levels), but data remain preliminary and not widely replicated.

In summary, the strongest evidence-based links are **indirect**:
- Protective higher ESR against dopaminergic neuron loss in PD.
- Dopamine receptor-mediated immune modulation in inflammatory diseases where ESR rises.
- ESR as a monitoring tool for side effects of dopaminergic drugs.

No evidence supports dopamine routinely or directly influencing ESR in healthy individuals or most clinical scenarios.
