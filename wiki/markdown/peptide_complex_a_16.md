Here’s a **clear, accurate, and evidence-based summary** of what *Libidon* is and what is (and is not) known about its pharmacology, dosing, kinetics, safety, etc.

---

## ❗ What *Libidon* Actually Is

**Libidon** is **not a conventional pharmaceutical drug** with defined pharmacological actions, metabolism, or standardized clinical pharmacokinetics. It is marketed in many countries as a **dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator** primarily aimed at *men’s reproductive health and prostate support*. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

The active components are **peptide complexes** (labeled *A-16* or *A-21* depending on product/region) — short chains of amino acids derived from animal tissues — that are claimed to target prostate cells. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

Because it is a *supplement*, not an approved drug, there are **no standard pharmacological actions, no regulatory pharmacokinetic studies, no established half-life, no proven bioavailability values, and no official LD₅₀** data in humans or animals.

---

## 🧠 Reported/Claimed Actions

According to product descriptions and limited manufacturer materials:

### 🔹 Proposed (Not Clinically Proven) Effects

Libidon’s peptide complexes are claimed to:

* Support **prostate gland metabolic function**
* Assist in **prostate cell normalization**
* Improve **reproductive system function**
* Support **libido and ejaculate quality**
* Help with **erectile function**
* Support recovery/maintenance in **chronic prostatitis and BPH**
  (*BPH = benign prostatic hyperplasia*) ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

⚠️ Keep in mind: These actions are **not recognized drug mechanisms** validated by regulatory authorities. They are marketing descriptions based on “bioregulator” peptide concepts used in some alternative medicine traditions.

---

## 📊 Pharmacokinetics (What We *Don’t* Know)

Because Libidon is a supplement:

### ❌ **No reliably measured values exist for:**

* **Absorption/bioavailability** (including oral vs sublingual)
* **Onset of effect times**
* **Plasma half-life**
* **Metabolism**
* **Distribution**
* **Clearance/elimination**

Standard pharmacokinetic profiling (like what’s done for approved drugs) **has not been published in peer-reviewed literature** for this product or its proprietary peptides. Therefore, there are no verified numbers for:

* **Time to peak concentration (Tmax)**
* **Half-life (t½)**
* **Absolute or relative bioavailability**

This kind of data simply does not exist in recognized scientific databases for Libidon.

## 💊 Dosing Information (Marketed Use)

The available product formulations include:

### 1. **Capsule Form**

* Common recommendation: **1–2 capsules 1–2 times daily with meals**
* Each daily dose often delivers about **20–40 mg** of peptide complex A-16 or A-21
* Typical course: **1 month**, with optional repeats after 1–2 months
  (*source product info*) ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

### 2. **Sublingual (Drops / Lingual) Form**

* Suggested: **~10 drops under the tongue, twice daily**
* Daily exposure ~**10 mg peptide**
* Course: **~1 month** ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])

⚠️ These are *manufacturer recommendations* for a food supplement — **not clinically validated therapeutic doses.**

---

## 🩺 Safety, Side Effects & Toxicology

### ✅ What Is Generally Claimed

Manufacturers/labels often state that Libidon:

* Has **no side effects**
* Can be used with other male health treatments
* Is “well tolerated” ([Peptidi][3])

### ❌ Known Limitations

There are **no official safety studies** (no large clinical trials in humans, no FDA EMA pharmacovigilance, etc.) that provide:

* **LD₅₀ (median lethal dose)**
* **Therapeutic Index**
* Systemic toxicology
* Clinical adverse event rates

Because there’s no standardized pharmacology or controlled trials, risks cannot be quantified. Without LD₅₀ data, we **cannot give doses that “become dangerous.”**

⚠️ Supplements can still interact with medications (e.g., blood thinners, hormone therapies) and may cause allergic or idiosyncratic reactions even if marketed as “natural.”

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes Before Use

* Dietary supplements are **not regulated like drugs** in most countries. Their claimed effects are often **not clinically confirmed**.
* Terms like *“clinical studies”* on some vendor sites are usually **internal or small, non-peer-reviewed** and don’t meet regulatory evidence standards.
* If you are taking prescription drugs or have medical conditions, consult a physician before using any supplement.
