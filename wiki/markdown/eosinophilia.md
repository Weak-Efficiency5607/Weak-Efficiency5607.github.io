Having 1.24 G/L of eosinophils, which is above the reference range of 0.05–0.60 G/L, indicates **eosinophilia**, a condition characterized by an elevated number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response, particularly in allergic reactions and parasitic infections.

### Possible Causes of Eosinophilia:

1. **Allergic Disorders:**

   * Allergic rhinitis (hay fever)
   * Asthma
   * Eczema or atopic dermatitis
   * Drug reactions

2. **Parasitic Infections:**

   * Intestinal worms (helminths)
   * Tissue-invasive parasites (e.g., schistosomiasis or trichinosis)

3. **Autoimmune and Inflammatory Conditions:**

   * Eosinophilic esophagitis or gastroenteritis
   * Vasculitis (e.g., eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
   * Certain forms of arthritis

4. **Infections:**

   * Fungal or certain bacterial infections

5. **Blood Disorders:**

   * Leukemia or other blood cancers
   * Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)

6. **Other Causes:**

   * Endocrine disorders (e.g., adrenal insufficiency)
   * Certain toxins or environmental exposures

### Next Steps:

1. **Consult Your Doctor:**
   Elevated eosinophil levels require further evaluation to identify the underlying cause. Your doctor will take a thorough history, conduct a physical exam, and potentially order more tests.

2. **Additional Tests:**

   * Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
   * Blood smear
   * Parasite stool examination
   * Allergy testing
   * Imaging or biopsy (if an organ-specific issue is suspected)

3. **Treatment:**
   The treatment depends on the cause:

   * **Allergies:** Anti-allergic medications like antihistamines or corticosteroids.
   * **Parasitic infections:** Antiparasitic drugs.
   * **Chronic conditions:** Specialized treatment plans for diseases like autoimmune disorders or hypereosinophilic syndrome.

It's essential to address the root cause rather than focusing solely on the elevated eosinophil count.
