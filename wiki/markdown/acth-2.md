### Major Links Between ACTH and Dopamine

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and dopamine interact bidirectionally at multiple levels: in the regulation of pituitary hormone secretion, brain dopaminergic transmission, receptor-level interactions, and clinical/pathological conditions. These links are supported by extensive research in endocrinology, neuroendocrinology, and pharmacology. Below is a comprehensive overview of all established connections, grouped by category.

#### 1. Dopamine's Regulation of ACTH Secretion
Dopamine exerts both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on ACTH release, depending on receptor subtype, location, and physiological/pathological context.

- **Inhibitory effect via D2 receptors (primary link in humans)**  
  Dopamine tonically inhibits ACTH secretion from corticotroph cells through dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), particularly in pituitary adenomas causing Cushing's disease. Dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline, bromocriptine) suppress ACTH hypersecretion in ~30–40% of Cushing's disease cases and some ectopic ACTH syndromes by activating D2R on tumor cells, reducing POMC expression/ACTH release and sometimes inducing apoptosis.  
  This is a key medical therapy when tumors express D2R (common in corticotroph adenomas). In normal physiology, the inhibitory tone is weaker than for prolactin but present.

- **Inhibitory effect in the intermediate lobe (IL) of the pituitary**  
  In rodents and during specific states (e.g., lactation), dopamine from hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic (NEDA) neurons strongly inhibits ACTH/α-MSH secretion from IL melanotropes. During lactation, IL cells shift to producing ACTH (instead of α-MSH), and dopamine maintains inhibitory control.

- **Stimulatory effects (via D1/D2 or hypothalamic mechanisms)**  
  Dopamine can stimulate ACTH release, especially via D1 receptors or hypothalamic pathways. Apomorphine (dopamine agonist) increases plasma ACTH/cortisol in rats and humans; D1/D2 agonists enhance CRH/AVP-driven ACTH secretion.  
  Dopamine infusion potentiates ACTH/cortisol responses to dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide) in hyperprolactinemic patients.

#### 2. ACTH's Effects on the Dopaminergic System
ACTH (and its fragments) modulates dopamine release, receptor binding, and signaling, often in brain regions involved in motivation, motor control, and stress.

- **Enhancement of dopamine release**  
  ACTH(1–24) increases electrically stimulated dopamine release in septal and striatal slices (rodent models).

- **Upregulation of dopamine D2 receptors**  
  Chronic ACTH treatment increases D2 receptor binding/density in the striatum (developing rat brain) and accelerates adaptive changes in mesolimbic dopamine systems (e.g., during antidepressant treatment).

- **Direct interaction with dopamine D2 receptors**  
  ACTH/MSH-like peptides (especially ACTH(1–24) and fragments) competitively inhibit binding of dopamine agonists/antagonists (e.g., [³H]NPA, [³H]spiperone) to D2 receptors in striatum, pituitary, septum, and substantia nigra. This suggests ACTH can act as an endogenous D2 receptor antagonist/ligand.

- **Behavioral/synergistic effects**  
  ACTH fragments (e.g., ACTH(4–9)) potentiate effects of dopamine agonists and antidepressants on immobility (forced swim test), suggesting synergy in reward/motivation pathways.

#### 3. Shared Involvement in Stress, HPA Axis, and Psychiatric Conditions
- Both systems are activated by stress: psychological stress triggers dopamine release in mesolimbic areas and HPA activation (ACTH → cortisol). Early-life stress/maternal care alters both dopamine and HPA responses long-term.
- In schizophrenia (paranoid subtype), patients show exaggerated ACTH/cortisol responses to dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide).
- In infantile spasms/West syndrome, ACTH therapy normalizes elevated CSF dopamine metabolites, suggesting ACTH modulates central dopamine turnover.

#### 4. Other/Species-Specific Links
- In amphibians (e.g., frog adrenal gland), dopamine directly inhibits ACTH-stimulated corticosteroid secretion.
- L-DOPA (dopamine precursor) can indirectly raise cortisol via ACTH in some contexts.

These interactions highlight a complex, context-dependent relationship: dopamine predominantly inhibits pathological ACTH hypersecretion (therapeutically useful), while ACTH peptides can antagonize or modulate central dopamine signaling (relevant to behavior, development, and stress). No evidence exists for a single unidirectional link—bidirectional and receptor-specific effects predominate.
