No, CoQ10 supplementation does not induce downregulation of endogenous production or other persistent downregulatory effects after discontinuation. Pharmacokinetic studies and safety assessments indicate that exogenous CoQ10 does not influence the body's natural biosynthesis of CoQ10, and plasma/tissue levels return to baseline without accumulation or lasting changes. This holds true even after long-term use, such as 9 months of supplementation followed by withdrawal, where blood concentrations revert to pretreatment levels.

However, in certain clinical contexts—like heart disease, statin use (which depletes CoQ10), or chronic fatigue—stopping supplementation may lead to a return or worsening of symptoms if the extra CoQ10 was addressing an underlying deficiency or mitochondrial dysfunction. This is not due to downregulation but rather the loss of supplemental support for cellular energy production. CoQ10 is considered highly safe, with no evidence of tolerance, dependence, or withdrawal syndromes in healthy individuals.
