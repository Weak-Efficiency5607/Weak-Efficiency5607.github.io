Here’s a **comprehensive, evidence-based summary of the pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics (half-life/bioavailability), and dosing/safety data for pyrroloquinoline quinone (commonly called PQQ)** based on peer-reviewed literature. However, note that *rigorous clinical pharmacokinetic data (e.g., multiple half-lives, absolute bioavailability via different routes, detailed human dose-response curves) are **very limited*** in the published literature.

---

## 🔬 **1. Primary Pharmacological Actions of PQQ**

PQQ is a *bioactive quinone* with multiple proposed mechanisms:

### **A. Redox/Antioxidant Activity**

* PQQ is a potent **redox-active molecule**, cycling between oxidized and reduced states, acting as a free-radical scavenger and *antioxidant*. ([MDPI][1])

### **B. Mitochondrial Function**

* PQQ **stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis** — increasing mitochondrial number/efficiency, likely via **activation of CREB and PGC-1α signaling**, and enhancing **SIRT1/PGC-1α expression**. ([ACS Publications][2])

### **C. Anti-Inflammatory & Immune-Modulating Effects**

* Clinical studies show PQQ *reduces inflammatory markers* such as **C-reactive protein and IL-6** when supplemented (e.g., changes seen with ongoing intake). ([PubMed][3])

### **D. Neuroprotective Actions**

* PQQ exhibits **neuroprotective effects** in models of neuronal stress and may influence cognitive function — improvement in memory and executive function parameters has been reported in double-blind human trials. ([PubMed][4])

### **E. Metabolic & Cardiovascular Activity**

* While evidence varies, PQQ has been linked to:

  * **Improved mitochondrial energy metabolism**
  * **Cardioprotective models** (animal)
  * **Potential improvements in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism** (preclinical/epidemiologic) ([MDPI][1])

### **F. Anticancer / Cellular Pathway Effects (Experimental)**

* In vitro data suggests PQQ can *induce apoptosis* in cancer cells via mitochondrial pathways, but this is **not established clinically**. ([jcancer.org][5])

## 🧠 **2. Pharmacokinetics (Absorption, Distribution, Half-Life, Bioavailability)**

### **Absorption**

* Animal data suggests PQQ is *readily absorbed orally* (~62% absorption in mice), with significant renal excretion within 24 h. ([PubMed][6])

### **Plasma Levels & Elimination (Human Data)**

* In small human studies:

  * **Single oral dose (2 mg/kg)** achieved peak plasma levels ~ *9 nM (~3.4 ng/mL) at ~2 h* post-dose. ([J-STAGE][7])
  * In a high-dose arm (**100 mg/day**), plasma levels reached ~16–54 nM at ~3 h, returning to trace by 24 h. ([J-STAGE][7])

### **Half-Life**

* Direct human half-life studies are **limited or unavailable**.
* In vitro chemical studies indicate PQQ adduct formation/disappearance half-lives ~45 min to ~60 min under controlled pH conditions — *not directly reflective of human systemic half-life*. ([MDPI][1])

### **Bioavailability**

* A cited pharmacokinetic summary suggests ~**62% bioavailability** via oral intake and *primary renal excretion* of unchanged PQQ (likely in humans/animals), with minimal metabolic alteration — but **authoritative human PK data is sparse**. ([ErgoYoung™][8])

### **Other Routes**

* **Non-oral routes** (e.g., IV) have no reliable human pharmacokinetic data published.

## 💊 **3. Dosing, Safety, and Toxicology**

### **Human Doses Reported in Studies**

* Typical oral **supplement doses in human research** range:

  * **5–10 mg/day** — some mitochondrial/anti-inflammatory effects reported. ([OUP Academic][9])
  * **10–20 mg/day** — commonly used in cognitive and metabolic studies. ([OUP Academic][9])
  * **Up to 100 mg/day** — studied in clinical trials without serious adverse effects. ([PMC][10])

### **Minimum Effective Range**

* No *official* minimum effective dose is defined; often **10-20 mg/day** is used for general bioactivity in human studies. ([OUP Academic][9])

### **NOAEL (No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level)**

* Animal toxicology studies indicate a **NOAEL of ~100 mg/kg body weight/day** in repeated doses. ([PMC][10])

### **Safety/Toxicity**

* PQQ is considered **generally safe** at studied human doses (up to ~100 mg/day), with high safety margins relative to toxic doses in animals. ([European Food Safety Authority][11])
* Large oral acute toxicity in rodents showed LD₅₀ often >1000 mg/kg (varies by sex/species). ([PubMed][12])

### **Adverse Effects**

* Generally mild or rare; some reports (mostly anecdotal) include mild headache, GI discomfort or insomnia, but *not consistently shown in controlled trials*. ([NutritionBase][13])

### **Contraindications**

* Insufficient data to recommend for **pregnant or lactating women**, or **children**. ([NutritionBase][13])

### **High-Dose Risks**

* Very high supplemental doses (far above documented clinical usage) might theoretically stress renal function in susceptible individuals — *based on animal findings*, not strong human evidence. ([NutritionBase][13])

## ⚠️ **Important Notes Before Use**

* High-quality human **pharmacokinetics** (multiple dose levels, clear half-life, multiple administration routes) *are not well established* in current published literature.
* Evidence for functional benefits varies by outcome (mitochondrial, cognitive, inflammatory), and *not all claimed effects are clinically confirmed*.
* This information is **for education only** and is *not medical advice*. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting supplementation, especially at higher doses or in combination with medications.
