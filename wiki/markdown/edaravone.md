### Pharmacological Actions of Edaravone (CAS 89-25-8)
Edaravone is primarily a free radical scavenger and neuroprotective agent approved for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in regions like the US, Canada, and Japan, and for acute ischemic stroke in Japan. Its actions stem from antioxidant properties, targeting oxidative stress implicated in neuronal damage. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions based on available data, including mechanisms and any quantitative values where reported (e.g., from clinical studies, PK models, or in vitro/in vivo assays). Quantitative "values" for influence are limited, as most data is qualitative or from disease-specific outcomes (e.g., functional scores in trials). Where possible, I've included metrics like inhibition rates, exposure levels, or efficacy measures to illustrate influence. I've provided as many values as available from reliable sources.

#### 1. **Free Radical Scavenging**
   - **Description/Influence**: Edaravone scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), preventing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. This reduces neuronal cell death in conditions like ALS and ischemia.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - Scavenges •OH and ONOO⁻ radicals effectively in vitro, with no effect on superoxide (O₂⁻) production.
     - In animal models of brain ischemia, it suppresses ROS-induced inflammatory oxidative stress post-reperfusion.
     - In human ALS trials (e.g., 6-month study with 137 participants), edaravone (60 mg IV) reduced decline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score by ~2.49 points vs. placebo (p=0.0013), indicating delayed functional loss due to ROS scavenging.
     - Time-related influence: Onset of radical scavenging is rapid (T_max 0.5-1 hour post-dose), with effects lasting aligned to half-life (4.5-9 hours).

#### 2. **Antioxidant Activity**
   - **Description/Influence**: Inhibits lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from oxidative stress. This ameliorates neuronal damage in ischemia and ALS by limiting extent of cell death.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - Inhibits lipid peroxidation induced by lipid peroxides in endothelial cells (in vitro).
     - In rat models, oral doses (30-300 mg) reduce markers of oxidative stress (e.g., malondialdehyde levels) dose-dependently.
     - In stroke models, it suppresses reperfusion injury, improving recovery scores in humans post-thrombolysis (e.g., reduced infarct size in animal studies by 20-50%).
     - Time-related influence: Peak antioxidant effects correlate with C_max (1656 ng/mL oral, 1253 ng/mL IV), decaying over half-life.

#### 3. **Neuroprotective Effects**
   - **Description/Influence**: Protects neurons from oxidative stress-induced death, delaying disease progression in ALS and reducing infarct size in stroke. It crosses the blood-brain barrier to exert direct effects.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - In ALS, slows motor neuron death; 6-month trial showed less decline in daily functioning (ALSFRS-R difference: 2.49 points).
     - In ischemic stroke animal models, reduces neuronal damage by inhibiting endothelial injury.
     - Upregulates Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator) in humans, reducing apoptosis by ~30-50% in in vitro neuronal cultures exposed to oxidative stress.
     - In rat brain ischemia, ameliorates damage with ED50-like values around 3-10 mg/kg IV.
     - Time-related influence: Neuroprotection builds with repeated dosing (e.g., 14-day cycles), with plasma exposure (AUC 0-∞ ~800-1600 ng·h/mL at therapeutic doses) correlating to reduced neuronal loss over 24-48 weeks.

#### 4. **Anti-Apoptotic Activity**
   - **Description/Influence**: Inhibits programmed cell death in neurons by reducing ROS-mediated apoptosis, particularly in ALS and stroke.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - Blocks apoptosis in glutamate-exposed neuronal cultures (in vitro IC50 ~10-50 μM).
     - In ALS models, prevents motor neuron apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, with efficacy in trials showing preserved function (e.g., 33% less decline in ALSFRS-R over 24 weeks).
     - Time-related influence: Effects peak at T_max, sustained for duration of exposure (half-life 4.5-9 hours).

#### 5. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**
   - **Description/Influence**: Suppresses proinflammatory responses, including neutrophil activation and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), reducing inflammation in ischemic brain tissue.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - Inhibits neutrophil activation in vitro, reducing inflammatory markers post-ischemia.
     - In animal models, suppresses iNOS/nNOS expression by 20-40%, ameliorating ROS-induced inflammation after reperfusion.
     - In human stroke studies, reduces post-ischemic inflammation, contributing to better recovery (e.g., improved modified Rankin Scale scores).
     - Time-related influence: Anti-inflammatory effects observed within 1-2 hours post-infusion, aligning with rapid absorption.

#### 6. **Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)**
   - **Description/Influence**: Inhibits MMP-9-related brain hemorrhage, particularly in thrombolysis-treated stroke, by stabilizing blood-brain barrier.
   - **Quantitative Values**:
     - In rat models treated with tPA, inhibits MMP-9 activity, reducing hemorrhage risk by ~50%.
     - No specific human quantitative data, but supports use in stroke to prevent complications.
     - Time-related influence: Acute effect within T_max window.

#### 7. **Other Actions (Less Primary)**
   - Prevents endothelial cell damage and suppresses reperfusion injury in stroke models.
   - Potential inhibition of glutamate toxicity in neuronal cultures.

These actions primarily influence by reducing oxidative burden, with cumulative effects in chronic use (e.g., ALS). Quantitative influence is often measured via disease outcomes (e.g., ALSFRS-R scores) rather than direct action metrics, as edaravone's exact mechanism in ALS remains partially unclear.

### Half-Life
- **Parent Compound (Edaravone)**: Mean terminal elimination half-life is 4.5-9.75 hours (IV or oral). Commonly reported as 4.5-6 hours in most studies.
- **Metabolites**: Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates have half-lives of 2-3 hours (up to 3-6.4 hours in some reports).
- Variations: Slightly longer (up to 9.75 hours) after oral administration due to absorption dynamics; 1-2 hours in rat IV studies (preclinical).

### Bioavailabilities by Route
- **Intravenous (IV)**: 100% (complete bioavailability as directly infused).
- **Oral**: Absolute bioavailability ~57-60% (due to first-pass metabolism via UGT enzymes and sulfotransferases). Nonlinear pharmacokinetics observed over 30-300 mg doses, with higher doses showing disproportionate increases in C_max and AUC.
  - Food effect: High-fat meal reduces C_max and AUC by ~20-30%.
  - In bioequivalence studies, 105 mg oral suspension achieves equivalent AUC to 60 mg IV, despite lower bioavailability.
- **Other Routes**: No data on subcutaneous, intramuscular, or topical; primarily IV and oral. Crosses blood-brain barrier readily (Vd indicates brain distribution).

### Dosages
Dosages vary by indication and route. Edaravone is cycled in ALS to minimize exposure while maintaining efficacy. Safe range is based on clinical trials (up to 300 mg tested orally, but approved doses are lower); toxicity is low (oral LD50 in rats: 1915 mg/kg). Minimum effective dose is indication-specific, derived from trials.

#### For ALS (Approved in US, Japan, Canada):
- **IV (Radicava)**: 60 mg infused over 60 minutes once daily.
  - Cycle: Initial: 14 consecutive days, then 14 days off. Subsequent: 10 days on within 28-day cycles.
  - Minimum effective: 60 mg (trial dose; lower not established for efficacy).
  - Safe range: 60 mg daily (no upper limit defined, but trials up to 60 mg); adjust for renal/hepatic impairment if needed.
- **Oral Suspension (Radicava ORS, 105 mg/5 mL)**: 105 mg (5 mL) once daily, taken after overnight fast (or via feeding tube).
  - Cycle: Same as IV (14 days on initial, then 10/28 days).
  - Minimum effective: ~100-105 mg (equivalent to 60 mg IV based on AUC).
  - Safe range: 105 mg daily; trials tested 30-300 mg with good tolerability (no accumulation with repeated dosing). Higher doses (e.g., 300 mg) show nonlinear PK but remain safe in healthy adults.

#### For Acute Ischemic Stroke (Approved in Japan):
- **IV**: 30 mg twice daily (total 60 mg/day) infused over 30 minutes each, for up to 14 days.
  - Minimum effective: 30 mg/dose (based on stroke trials showing reduced infarct size).
  - Safe range: 60 mg/day; used acutely, with monitoring for hypersensitivity.

#### General Safety and Toxicity:
- No established maximum tolerated dose in humans, but single oral doses up to 300 mg were safe in PK studies (adverse events: mild, e.g., headache, bruising in 2-10% more than placebo).
- Overdose: Limited data; supportive care recommended.
- Adjustments: No dose change for mild renal/hepatic impairment; caution in severe cases.

For more values, edaravone shows dose-proportional increases in exposure (AUC, C_max) at lower doses (20-60 mg IV), but nonlinear at higher oral ranges. Plasma protein binding: 92%. Clearance: 35.9 L/h IV, 67.9 L/h oral. No drug accumulation with daily dosing.
