**Sodium polydihydroxyphenylene thiosulfonate** (also known as **Hypoxen** or **Gipoksen** in Russian) is a synthetic compound primarily marketed in Russia as an antihypoxant (anti-hypoxic agent) and antioxidant. It is available as 250 mg oral capsules and is used to improve cellular oxygen utilization, particularly under conditions of oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). It is not widely approved or studied outside Russia, and human clinical data (especially international-standard trials) are limited.

### Pharmacological Actions
The main actions are:

- **Antihypoxic effect** — Enhances the efficiency of tissue respiration (oxygen utilization) in hypoxic conditions, particularly in high-metabolism organs like the brain, heart muscle, and liver. It reduces overall oxygen consumption during heavy physical or mental stress while maintaining performance.
- **Antioxidant effect** — Helps protect cells from oxidative stress.
- **Metabolic modulation** — Improves coupling in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, accelerates oxidative phosphorylation, inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and activates mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP) in muscles and heart tissue. This supports energy production under stress.

Additional effects include reduced mental/physical fatigue, improved endurance in extreme environments (e.g., high altitude, underwater work, Arctic conditions), faster recovery from exertion/disease, and support in complex therapy for conditions involving hypoxia (e.g., stable angina, hypertension, heart failure, respiratory diseases).

No detailed time-course data (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect, duration of individual pharmacological actions) is available in accessible sources. Metabolites are detectable in urine for ≥48 hours after dosing, but this reflects elimination rather than active effect duration.

### Pharmacokinetics
Very limited data exists:

- **Route of administration** — Primarily oral (capsules).
- **Bioavailability** — Not quantified in available sources; it is effective orally, implying reasonable absorption, but no percentage is reported.
- **Half-life** — Not reported.
- **Other parameters** (absorption rate, distribution, metabolism, excretion) — Not detailed. It is a mixture of oligomeric species, with limited intact dimer and various metabolites (e.g., sulfurothioate and glucuronide/sulfoconjugate forms) identified in urine.

No intravenous, intramuscular, or other routes are described.

### Dosage Information
- **Form** — 250 mg capsules.
- **Calculation** — Primarily based on body weight (daily dose in capsules):
  - 60–70 kg: 3–4 capsules (750–1,000 mg/day)
  - 70–80 kg: 4–6 capsules (1,000–1,500 mg/day)
  - 80–90 kg: 6–8 capsules (1,500–2,000 mg/day)
  - 90–100 kg: 8–10 capsules (2,000–2,500 mg/day)
  - 100–120 kg: 10–12 capsules (2,500–3,000 mg/day)

- **Single dose** — 2–4 capsules (500–1,000 mg).
- **Maximum daily** — 12 capsules (3,000 mg).
- **Regimens** (examples from prescribing info):
  - Extreme hypoxia/physical stress: Full daily dose 30–60 minutes before load.
  - Chronic fatigue/recovery: Half daily dose twice daily for 2–3 weeks (repeat courses with 1–2 week breaks).
  - Heart/respiratory conditions: Half daily dose twice daily for 10–30 days (with intervals).

- **Minimum effective** — Not explicitly defined, but regimens start around 750 mg/day (or lower in split doses for maintenance).
- **Maximum without high risks** — Up to 3,000 mg/day (recommended max; no major toxicity reported at this level in prescribing info).
- **LD50** — Not reported in any sources (animal or human).
- **When it becomes dangerous** — Overdose symptoms include dry mouth, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and (rarely) respiratory depression. Treatment is supportive (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, symptomatic care). No high-risk threshold beyond overdose symptoms is specified.

Overall, the compound appears to have a favorable safety profile at recommended doses (rare side effects: allergic reactions or intolerance), but data is sparse due to limited international research.
