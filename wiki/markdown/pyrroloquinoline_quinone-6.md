Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a redox cofactor and antioxidant compound found in certain foods (e.g., fermented soybeans, green tea) and available as a supplement. It is primarily studied for its roles in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating inflammation. The query focuses on whether PQQ induces downregulations (e.g., reduced gene expression, protein levels, or pathway activity) that persist after discontinuation, the involved pathways, and the likelihood of such effects.

Based on available scientific evidence from preclinical (animal and cell-based) studies and limited human trials, PQQ does induce downregulations in specific pathways, often as part of its beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-stress mechanisms. Some of these effects can persist after stopping PQQ, particularly in contexts like early-life exposure, but they are generally protective rather than harmful. There is no strong evidence of adverse persistent downregulations (e.g., leading to tolerance, dependency, or long-term deficits), though temporary reversal of PQQ's stimulatory effects (e.g., on mitochondria) may occur upon withdrawal. Below, I analyze the pathways, persistence, and probabilities.

### Key Pathways Where PQQ Induces Downregulation
PQQ influences multiple cellular pathways, often downregulating proinflammatory, oxidative stress, and senescence-related processes while upregulating protective ones (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α). Downregulations are typically dose- and context-dependent, observed in models of inflammation, aging, obesity, cancer, and oxidative stress. Major pathways include:

1. **NF-κB Pathway (Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B Cells)**:
   - **Effect**: PQQ downregulates NF-κB activation, reducing transcription of proinflammatory genes like IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NOS2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase). This inhibits cytokine production and lipid peroxidation.
   - **Mechanism**: PQQ acts as an antioxidant, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activate NF-κB. It also modulates upstream signals to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits (e.g., p65).
   - **Examples**: In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in microglia or Kupffer cells, PQQ reduces NF-κB-driven expression of NO and PGE2. In obesity models, it lowers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a downstream effector.
   - **Relevance**: This pathway is key for PQQ's anti-inflammatory effects, seen in conditions like sepsis, osteoarthritis, and hepatic lipotoxicity.

2. **MAPK Pathways (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, including JNK/p38 MAPK)**:
   - **Effect**: PQQ downregulates phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK, attenuating stress responses, apoptosis, and inflammation. It can also modulate ERK1/2 in context-specific ways (e.g., reducing ERK2 in neuronal cells).
   - **Mechanism**: PQQ inhibits ROS-mediated activation of these kinases, disrupting signals that promote cell death or catabolic processes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases like MMP-1 and MMP-13 in osteoarthritis).
   - **Examples**: In denervated skeletal muscle atrophy, PQQ suppresses JNK/p38 MAPK to reduce mitophagy (excessive mitochondrial breakdown) and fiber type shifts. In cancer cells, it alters phosphorylated MAPK levels to promote apoptosis.

3. **JAK/STAT Pathway (Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription)**:
   - **Effect**: PQQ downregulates JAK2/STAT3 activation, limiting proinflammatory cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation in stressed tissues.
   - **Mechanism**: By reducing oxidative stress, PQQ interrupts JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT proteins, which otherwise translocate to the nucleus and drive gene expression.
   - **Examples**: In denervation-induced muscle atrophy, PQQ inhibits JAK2/STAT3 to preserve muscle mass. It also modulates this in renal or hepatic inflammation models.

4. **TGF-β/Smad Pathway (Transforming Growth Factor Beta/Smad)**:
   - **Effect**: PQQ downregulates TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling, reducing fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammatory remodeling.
   - **Mechanism**: PQQ limits ROS and cytokine crosstalk that amplifies TGF-β effects.
   - **Examples**: Observed in skeletal muscle atrophy and fibrosis models, where it prevents excessive extracellular matrix deposition.

5. **Other Downregulations**:
   - **Apoptotic/Senescence Pathways**: PQQ downregulates Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) in cancer cells to induce mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, but this is context-specific (not seen in healthy cells). It also reduces senescence markers like p16 and p21 in oxidative stress models.
   - **CUL3 (Cullin 3)**: In sepsis models, PQQ downregulates CUL3, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes oxidative stress and apoptosis in liver cells.
   - **Indirect Effects**: While PQQ upregulates Nrf2 (via Keap1 inhibition) for antioxidant defense, this can indirectly downregulate oxidative stress pathways (e.g., reducing HO-1, NQO-1, GST, and GPx-3 overexpression in response to stress).

These downregulations are generally beneficial, countering excessive inflammation or stress without evidence of over-suppression in healthy systems.

### Persistence of Downregulations After Discontinuation
- **Evidence of Persistent Effects**: In some models, downregulations (especially of proinflammatory genes) persist after stopping PQQ, likely due to epigenetic or developmental programming.
  - In obese mouse models with early-life (prenatal/lactation) PQQ exposure, withdrawal at weaning led to sustained lower expression of NOS2, NLRP3, IL-6, and PTGS2 (proinflammatory genes) into adulthood, reducing hepatic inflammation and lipotoxicity. This suggests lasting downregulation via NF-κB and related pathways.
  - In intrauterine growth restriction models, PQQ during pregnancy increased cardiomyocyte endowment with persistent benefits into adulthood post-withdrawal.
  - These effects are attributed to PQQ's influence on mitochondrial function and stress responses during critical developmental windows, potentially altering gene expression long-term.
- **Non-Persistent or Reversible Effects**: In adult supplementation, effects often reverse quickly.
  - Mitochondrial biogenesis (upregulated by PQQ via PGC-1α) reverts to baseline within days to a week in animal studies upon depletion. This could manifest as a temporary "downregulation" of enhanced mitochondrial activity, leading to perceived energy dips.
  - Anecdotal human reports (e.g., from forums) describe fatigue, headaches, or low energy 3–7 days after stopping, possibly due to reversal of PQQ's stimulatory effects. PQQ's half-life is ~5 hours, but metabolites may linger longer.
  - No clinical studies confirm persistent harmful downregulations in adults; human trials (up to 12 weeks) show no adverse events post-discontinuation.

Overall, persistence is more likely in early-life exposure (developmental programming) than in short-term adult use.

### Estimated Possibilities of Downregulations
Probabilities are estimated based on preclinical data (high consistency in animal/cell models) and limited human evidence (small trials, no long-term withdrawal studies). Assume typical supplement doses (10–20 mg/day).

- **Likelihood of Inducing Downregulations During Use**: High (80–90%). PQQ consistently downregulates inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-κB, MAPK) in stress/inflammation models, with beneficial outcomes like reduced cytokine levels.
- **Likelihood of Persistent Downregulations After Stopping**:
  - **Beneficial Persistence (e.g., reduced inflammation)**: Moderate (40–60%) in early-life or chronic exposure models; low (10–20%) in short-term adult use. Seen in ~50% of relevant animal studies (e.g., obesity programming).
  - **Adverse or Reversible "Downregulation" (e.g., mitochondrial reversal leading to temporary fatigue)**: Low to moderate (20–40%) based on anecdotal reports and animal depletion data. Rare in clinical trials (<5% adverse events reported).
  - **No Effect or Full Reversal**: High (60–80%) in adults; pathways return to baseline without lasting changes.
- **Factors Influencing Probability**:
  - **Duration/Dose**: Longer exposure (weeks–months) or higher doses (>20 mg) increases persistence odds.
  - **Context**: Higher in disease states (e.g., inflammation, obesity) where PQQ's effects address imbalances.
  - **Individual Variability**: Genetics, diet, and exercise may affect reversal speed; those with low baseline mitochondrial function might notice withdrawal more.
  - **Risk of Harm**: Very low (<5%). No toxicity or genotoxicity reported; PQQ is considered safe in human studies.

In summary, PQQ induces downregulations primarily in anti-inflammatory and stress pathways (e.g., NF-κB, MAPK, JAK/STAT), which can persist beneficially after discontinuation in certain contexts like early-life supplementation. However, adult use typically sees reversible effects without evidence of harmful long-term downregulations. More human studies on withdrawal are needed for definitive insights. If considering PQQ, consult a healthcare provider, especially for long-term use.
