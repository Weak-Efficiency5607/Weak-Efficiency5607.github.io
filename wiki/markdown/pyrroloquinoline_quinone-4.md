No, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) does not appear to induce persistent downregulations after discontinuation based on available research. While PQQ can downregulate certain factors like inflammatory markers (e.g., Nos2 expression), matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP-1 and MMP-13), and anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 in cancer cells) during active use, these changes are typically beneficial and context-specific, such as reducing inflammation or slowing disease progression.

In studies examining post-discontinuation effects:
- Protective outcomes, such as reduced hepatic inflammation and improved mitochondrial function, can persist long-term in developmental models (e.g., in obese mice offspring after weaning withdrawal).
- In general adult supplementation, effects like enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic improvements reverse to baseline levels within days to a week upon stopping, with no evidence of negative withdrawal symptoms or worsened states (e.g., no tolerance buildup or rebound effects reported in animal or human trials).
- Human studies (e.g., on muscle strength, fatigue, and sleep) report no adverse events or tolerance issues over 8–12 weeks, and short-term use shows no side effects beyond rare mild symptoms like headaches at high doses.

Overall, PQQ's actions are reversible without inducing harmful persistent downregulations, and it is considered safe with no toxicity at typical supplemental doses (e.g., 10–20 mg/day). If concerned about individual response, consult a healthcare provider before starting or stopping.
