The absorption of protein (via amino acids) in the intestine is often sodium-dependent, meaning electrolytes like sodium can significantly influence the rate and extent of absorption. Based on available studies, the presence of sodium can enhance amino acid absorption, while its absence reduces it. Here are the specific values found from research (note: no direct studies on protein drinks were identified, but these are from in vitro and in vivo intestinal absorption experiments; values are for individual amino acids as protein is hydrolyzed to amino acids for absorption):

- Alanine uptake in rabbit ileal mucosa: Reduced by 75% in sodium-free medium (meaning absorption is 300% higher with sodium relative to without).
- L-Alanine absorption in rat intestine: Significant decrease in sodium-free medium (exact percentage not quantified in available data, but described as substantial).
- General neutral amino acids: Absorption reduced by 70-90% in sodium-free conditions across various studies on sodium-dependent transporters (e.g., system A transporters), with 10-30% occurring via sodium-independent pathways (e.g., system L).
- Glycine and alanine: Molar ratios of amino acid to sodium absorption are approximately 1:1, indicating direct coupling; without sodium, net absorption approaches 0% for sodium-dependent components.
- In high-salt diets (excess electrolytes): May inhibit protein digestion efficiency slightly (not quantified precisely, but linked to reduced pancreatic enzyme secretion), leading to lower overall absorption compared to normal salt levels.

These values vary by amino acid type (neutral amino acids are more sodium-dependent than basic or acidic ones) and experimental conditions. In a protein drink context, adding electrolytes (e.g., 20-50 mM sodium) could theoretically increase absorption by 200-400% relative to a sodium-free formulation, but the gastrointestinal tract naturally has sodium from secretions, so the practical effect may be smaller (10-30% improvement in low-sodium scenarios like dehydration). No saturation was observed in absorption rates with increasing sodium up to studied levels. For comprehensive advice, consult a nutritionist, as individual factors like gut health affect outcomes.
