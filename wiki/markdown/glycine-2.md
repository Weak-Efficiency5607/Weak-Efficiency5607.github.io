**Glycine (aminoacetic acid) is a non-essential amino acid that serves endogenous roles but exhibits pharmacological effects primarily when supplemented (orally, IV, or otherwise), acting via specific receptors and metabolic pathways.**

### Key Pharmacological Actions and Associated Time Parameters
Glycine’s actions stem from:
- **Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyRs)**: Ligand-gated Cl⁻ channels (α1–α4 + β subunits), causing hyperpolarization/inhibition (CNS: spinal cord/brainstem/retina for motor/sensory/pain/reflex control; immune cells for anti-inflammatory effects). Effective channel opening ~1–3 mM (far above normal plasma ~200–300 µM).
- **Strychnine-insensitive glycine site on NMDA receptors**: Co-agonist with glutamate, enhancing excitatory signaling (supports NMDA hypofunction hypothesis in schizophrenia negative symptoms/cognition).
- **Other**: GPRC6A (GPCR), transporters; precursor for glutathione (antioxidant), creatine; one-carbon metabolism; cytoprotection (e.g., blocks plasma membrane pores, attenuates neutrophils/ROS in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), endotoxemia, liver injury).

Specific actions with time values (where data exist; many are plasma PK-driven or chronic; synaptic effects are fast but supplemental systemic effects lag absorption/brain entry):

1. **Inhibitory neurotransmission/antispastic (GlyR-mediated)**:
   - Synaptic: Milliseconds–seconds (IPSP via Cl⁻ influx).
   - Supplemental (antispastic/antinociceptive potential): Plasma peak ~30 min post-oral (1 g dose → +54% plasma glycine); effects duration aligns with elevated levels (~3 h return to baseline for low doses). Higher doses prolong via intracellular accumulation.

2. **NMDA co-agonism/antipsychotic (negative symptoms in schizophrenia, cognition)**:
   - Acute brain/CSF increase: Oral/IV raises levels; plasma Tmax ~0.5–4 h (formulation-dependent), brain entry documented.
   - Clinical effects: Onset over weeks (6–8 weeks in trials at 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day); no acute single-dose data for symptoms. Improves negative symptoms (e.g., ~30% reduction in PANSS negative subscale in some trials), cognition/alertness in some studies.
   - Duration: Requires chronic dosing; effects wane post-discontinuation.

3. **Anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory**:
   - GlyR-dependent (immune cells: macrophages, Kupffer, neutrophils, T-cells): Hyperpolarization → ↓Ca²⁺ influx → ↓TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, superoxide; ↑IL-10; NF-κB inhibition (partly NRF2-mediated). Effective at 1–3 mM.
   - Acute experimental (e.g., LPS/endotoxemia, sepsis, IRI models): Rapid (minutes–hours) attenuation of cytokine surge, neutrophil infiltration, organ damage.
   - Chronic supp. (e.g., 0.1 g/kg/day ×14 days or 5 g/day): ↓pro-inflammatory cytokines/adipokines, improved insulin response; dietary 0.5% in models prevents infiltration.

4. **Antioxidant/cytoprotective (glutathione precursor, IRI protection)**:
   - GSH synthesis support: Ongoing with availability; supp. counters age/oxidative stress decline.
   - IRI/endotoxemia protection: Acute IV/oral (pre-/peri-ischemia) inhibits pore formation, ↓ROS/neutrophils; survival benefits in shock models within hours–days.

5. **Sleep-promoting**:
   - Lowers core temperature, shortens NREM latency, stabilizes sleep (possibly via NMDA in suprachiasmatic nucleus or GlyR).
   - Onset: 3 g oral ~30–60 min pre-bed; subjective improvements next day (↓fatigue, ↑alertness/cognition); polysomnography shows latency reduction in first sleep cycle. NREM increase in first ~90 min post-administration in some models.
   - Duration: Overnight effects; daytime benefits post-single dose.

Limited precise onset/duration per action due to reliance on plasma PK (rapid absorption/peak, short half-life) and chronic use in clinical contexts. Brain effects confirmed but BBB penetration may be rate-limiting at low doses.

### Pharmacokinetics
- **Half-life (apparent/elimination)**: Dose-dependent, 26–245 min (0.43–4.08 h); proportional to dose (e.g., low doses shorter, high doses longer due to intracellular accumulation/saturation). From IV/oral studies (10–91 g).
- **Absorption/Bioavailability**:
  - Oral: Rapid active transport (small intestine); high bioavailability (~60–90% estimates; predicted ~100% in models; "exceptional" in supplement PK). Plasma peak ~30 min (1 g dose), return to baseline ~3 h (low dose). Increases plasma/CSF/brain glycine.
  - IV: 100% (reference); used in some IRI/TPN contexts.
  - Tmax: ~0.5–1 h (solution) or longer (tablets); food may delay/increase exposure in some formulations.
- **Distribution**: Wide (including CNS); Vd not well quantified.
- **Metabolism/Excretion**: Hepatic (various enzymes/pathways: GSH, creatine, one-carbon, etc.); renal component.

### Dosages, Safe Range, Minimum Effective
- **Typical dietary**: ~2–3 g/day.
- **General supplemental (sleep, cognition, anti-inflam support)**: 3–5 g/day oral (safe/tolerated); minimum effective for sleep ~3 g pre-bed.
- **Schizophrenia (adjunct, negative symptoms; with non-clozapine antipsychotics)**: 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day (~25–60 g/day for average adult, divided 3x; titrate from ~4 g/day). Effects in 6–8 weeks. Minimum effective: Lower doses (e.g., 10–30 g) tried with mixed results; high doses more consistent in responsive patients. Avoid with clozapine (may worsen symptoms).
- **Safe range**: 1 g/day very well-tolerated; up to 6 g/day ×4 weeks possibly safe; higher (up to 90 g studied) tolerated short-term but nausea/GI risk increases. Long-term high-dose safety limited (potential neurotoxicity concerns unconfirmed). LD50 high (grams/kg in animals).
- **Other**: Stroke (acute, limited data); TPN/irrigation (specific formulations). Always under supervision for high doses.

**Evidence is strongest for sleep (low-dose) and schizophrenia adjunct (high-dose, mixed replication); many other actions are preclinical/promising but not standard therapy.** Consult a healthcare provider, especially with medications (e.g., interacts with clozapine) or conditions. High doses require monitoring.
