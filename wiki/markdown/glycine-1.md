**Pharmacological Actions of Glycine**

Glycine is a non-essential amino acid with several key pharmacological actions, primarily in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. It acts as both an inhibitory neurotransmitter and an excitatory co-agonist, depending on the receptor.

- **Inhibitory Neurotransmission (via Strychnine-Sensitive Glycine Receptors - GlyRs)**: Glycine binds to ligand-gated chloride channels (GlyRs) in the spinal cord, brainstem, and other CNS areas, increasing Cl⁻ influx, hyperpolarizing neurons, and reducing excitability. This mediates fast inhibitory signaling, regulating motor control, sensory processing (e.g., pain, hearing), and reflex arcs.

- **Excitatory Co-Agonism at NMDA Receptors**: Glycine binds to the strychnine-insensitive site on NMDA receptors (obligatory co-agonist with glutamate), facilitating receptor activation, Ca²⁺ influx, and enhanced excitatory neurotransmission. This is prominent in the forebrain and supports synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.

- **Antispastic Effects**: Enhances spinal inhibitory transmission via GlyRs, potentially reducing muscle spasticity.

- **Antipsychotic Potential**: Potentiates NMDA function, which may improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia (adjunctive therapy).

- **Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects**: Attenuates neutrophil oxidant production and protects against oxidative stress, hypoxia-reperfusion injury, and inflammation (e.g., in liver or endotoxin models).

- **Other Effects**: Hepatic detoxification (conjugation with toxins for excretion), potential metabolic benefits (e.g., insulin secretion modulation via NMDA in periphery), and indirect roles in sleep improvement or neuroprotection.

**Pharmacokinetic Parameters**

- **Absorption**: Rapidly absorbed from the small intestine via active transport (Na⁺/Cl⁻-dependent transporters). Oral administration shows peak plasma levels ~30 minutes post-ingestion.

- **Bioavailability**: High for oral route (near-complete absorption as an amino acid; studies show significant plasma increases, e.g., ~54% above baseline at 3 g dose). No exact percentage reported in most sources, but considered excellent.

- **Half-Life (Plasma)**: Dose-dependent, ranging from 0.43–4.08 hours (26–245 minutes). Increases proportionally with dose (e.g., shorter at low doses, longer at high doses due to saturation of metabolism).

- **Metabolism**: Primarily hepatic; degraded via glycine cleavage system or converted to serine/pyruvate.

- **Elimination**: Renal (as metabolites) and hepatic.

- **Other**: Plasma returns to baseline ~3 hours after oral dosing in studies.

**Dosage Information**

Dosages vary by indication and are generally oral (supplements or capsules). Glycine is well-tolerated, but high doses (>15 g/day) may cause mild GI upset (nausea, diarrhea).

- **General Supplementation/Sleep Improvement**: 3–5 g/day (often 3 g before bed for sleep effects). Minimum effective: ~3 g.

- **Schizophrenia (Adjunctive)**: 30–60 g/day (or 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day). Minimum effective: Often ~30 g/day in trials.

- **Antispastic or Other Therapeutic**: 2–60 g/day in clinical studies.

- **Safe Range**: Up to 6 g/day well-tolerated for weeks; studies show 90 g/day tolerated short-term. Doses of 1 g/day are very safe; avoid exceeding 60 g/day chronically without monitoring.

- **Other Routes**: IV (in parenteral nutrition or studies), irrigation (surgical). No standard oral bioavailability differences vs. other routes noted.

These values are from clinical studies and reviews; individual responses vary. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized use, especially at high doses.
