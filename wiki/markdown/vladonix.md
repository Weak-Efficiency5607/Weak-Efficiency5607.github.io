I searched extensively and **could not find any reliable pharmacological data on “Vladonix” as a characterized pharmaceutical drug** in the scientific literature. There are *commercial product descriptions* and some *clinic-like PDF brochures* that make broad claims, but **no peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies** providing the detailed values you asked for (half-life, bioavailability, LD₅₀, dose–response curves, etc.). What *does* exist are mostly supplement sales pages. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])

Below is what is known — **and what is *not* known — about Vladonix**:

---

## 🧬 What Vladonix *Is*

* Vladonix is sold as a **peptide bioregulator / dietary supplement** derived from peptide fractions isolated from the thymus of young animals (e.g., calves). ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])
* The active ingredient is usually described as a **“peptide complex A-6” (thymus peptides)**. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])
* Commercial sources claim it supports **immune system regulation and recovery after illness, stress, aging, chronic intoxication, and surgery**. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])

**Important:** All credible pharmaco-toxicological databases and peer-reviewed journals **do not list Vladonix as an approved medication**, and there are **no regulatory product monographs** specifying pharmacology as would exist for true drugs.

## 📌 Pharmacological *Actions* (Claims — Not Scientifically Verified)

According to product literature, Vladonix is claimed to:

* **Modulate the immune system**, particularly T-lymphocyte function. ([peptidesco.bg][2])
* **Normalize cellular metabolism in immune cells** and help restore immune function after stress/illness. ([peptidesco.bg][2])
* **Support recovery of immune parameters after radiation, chemotherapy, or environmental stress.** ([Peptidi][3])

⚠️ *None of these actions have been validated in rigorous pharmacological studies published in peer-reviewed journals.*

**No mechanisms (e.g., receptor targets, signaling pathways) are established** in the scientific literature.

---

## 📊 Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability, Absorption)

**There are no** published pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., blood levels, half-life, oral bioavailability, Tmax, Cmax) for Vladonix.

Peptide fragments derived from thymus tissue are not characterized like standard drugs:

* Peptides typically have **poor oral bioavailability** because they are digested in the GI tract unless specially formulated (e.g., sublingual). ([PMC][4])
* Without published studies, **half-life is unknown** and cannot be estimated reliably.

No credible values are available for:

| Parameter                  | Status  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| **Oral bioavailability**   | No data |
| **Half-life (t1/2)**       | No data |
| **Tmax / Cmax**            | No data |
| **Volume of distribution** | No data |

---

## 📍 Routes of Administration

From available product information:

* **Oral capsules** (most common): 1–2 capsules, 1–2 times a day with meals. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])
* **Sublingual drops**: 5–6 drops, 3–4 times a day before meals. ([peptide-shop.com][5])

Again: **These are usage suggestions from sellers, not medically validated dosing regimens.**

## 💊 Dosing Information (Supplement Labels Only)

Available product instructions (not scientific clinical doses):

| Form                 | Suggested Use                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capsules**         | 1–2 capsules, once or twice daily with meals for ~1 month. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1]) |
| **Sublingual drops** | 5–6 drops, 3–4 times daily before meals. ([peptide-shop.com][5])                 |

No recognized *minimum effective dose*, *maximum safe dose*, or *therapeutic index* has been established in controlled research.

---

## ☠️ Toxicology (LD₅₀ & Safety)

There are **no published LD₅₀, NOAEL, or MTD values** for Vladonix in animals or humans.

The available clinical documentation claims **no side effects or tolerance issues** in their cohort; however:

* These results are **not peer-reviewed**,
* Study design details are **not transparent**,
* They lack standard pharma safety evaluation data.

Therefore:
✔️ We **cannot estimate LD₅₀**.
✔️ We **cannot determine at what dose “it becomes dangerous.”**

## 🧪 Summary — What Is & Isn’t Known

### ✔️ Known (From Marketing/Clinical Brochures)

* Vladonix is a **dietary peptide supplement with thymus peptides**. ([shop-npcriz.lv][1])
* Claimed to support immune function and recovery. ([peptidesco.bg][2])
* Often taken orally or sublingually. ([peptide-shop.com][5])

### ❌ Not Known (No Scientific Data)

* **Pharmacokinetics:** half-life, bioavailability, Tmax, Cmax
* **Pharmacodynamics:** receptor targets, validated mechanisms
* **Toxicology:** LD₅₀, safe upper limit, therapeutic index
* **Clinically proven efficacy** in controlled trials

---

## 🧠 Important Safety Note

Before taking any peptide supplement:

* **Talk to a healthcare professional**, especially if you’re on medications, immunocompromised, pregnant, or have chronic illness.
* Be cautious of **unvalidated health claims** from supplement vendors.

If you want, I can help you compare Vladonix with peptide drugs that *do* have published pharmacology (e.g., Thymogen, other synthetic peptides) and provide real pharmacokinetic and dosing data — just let me know!
