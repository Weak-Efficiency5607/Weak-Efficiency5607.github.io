**Yes, Poly(I:C) (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) is frequently used in laboratories as a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog to mimic the immune responses and inflammatory effects of rhinovirus (RV) infections, particularly in airway epithelial cell models and animal studies of asthma exacerbations.**

Rhinovirus, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, generates dsRNA intermediates during replication, which activate pattern recognition receptors like TLR3. Poly(I:C) activates TLR3 similarly, inducing interferon production, cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10), and antiviral states in cells—effects often studied alongside or instead of live RV (e.g., RV-A16 or HRV1b) to model infection without biosafety risks of live virus.

Examples include:
- In vitro studies on human bronchial epithelial cells, where Poly(I:C) replicates TLR3-mediated antiviral activity and cytokine profiles seen with RV.
- Mouse models of viral asthma exacerbations, where Poly(I:C) induces neutrophilic inflammation and corticosteroid-resistant responses mirroring HRV.

**Note:** Poly(I:C) does not support actual viral replication (unlike live RV), so it's a surrogate for dsRNA-triggered signaling rather than full infection. Some studies highlight limitations, as live RV can show replication-dependent differences in inflammation. It's still a standard tool for these purposes in respiratory research.

**Yes, Poly(I:C) (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) is commonly used in laboratories as a synthetic mimic for rhinovirus (RV) infections.** It serves as a double-stranded RNA analog that activates pathways like TLR3, mimicking the dsRNA intermediates produced during rhinovirus replication (an ssRNA virus).

Researchers often use it alongside or instead of live rhinovirus (e.g., HRV16 or HRV1b) to study innate immune responses, cytokine production (like IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10), interferon signaling, and inflammation in airway epithelial cells, without the biosafety challenges of handling live virus.

Examples include:
- Pre-treatment studies where Poly(I:C) restores or modulates IFN responses before RV infection.
- Direct comparisons showing similar neutrophilic inflammation or pro-inflammatory profiles between Poly(I:C) and live RV.
- Models of asthma exacerbations or COPD where Poly(I:C) simulates RV-induced effects.

It's not a perfect replication of full viral replication cycles but reliably models the key signaling and inflammatory aspects of RV infection.
