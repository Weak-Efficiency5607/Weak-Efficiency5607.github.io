Here’s a *comprehensive summary* of what is *scientifically documented vs. what *manufacturers claim* about **Renisamin (a complex of proteins and nucleoproteins, marketed as a kidney bioregulator)** — including its pharmacological actions, clinical evidence status, **pharmacokinetics (half-life, bioavailability)**, **dosage ranges**, and safety information.

---

## **1. What Renisamin *Is* (Product Description)**

* **Composition:** A complex of proteins and nucleoproteins (polypeptides and nucleic acids) derived from bovine/kidney tissues. ([NootropicsBase.com][1])
* **Category:** *Dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator* — not approved as a therapeutic drug by major regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA, EMA). ([NootropicsBase.com][1])
* **Form:** Oral tablets (typically ~155 mg). ([NootropicsBase.com][1])

Manufacturers claim it selectively targets kidney tissues to:

* Restore kidney function
* Support repair of renal parenchyma and tubular cells
* Improve cellular metabolism and synthesis of essential proteins
* Reduce proteinuria and other urinary symptoms
* Help in early hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and kidney surgery recovery ([NootropicsBase.com][1])

**Important:** These claims are *manufacturer or supplement-provider assertions* and are **not established by clinical pharmacology studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals.** There are *no robust, controlled human pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies in the scientific literature* for Renisamin specifically. Available peer-reviewed evidence around *“peptide bioregulators”* generally is limited, with most data in basic research or preclinical/experimental contexts. ([PubMed][2])

## **2. Pharmacological Actions (Claims vs. Evidence)**

### **Manufacturer-Reported Actions**

Renisamin is claimed to:

* *Activate and accelerate* restoration of kidney functions
* Support *normalization of renal metabolism*
* Stimulate repair and growth of damaged renal cells
* Reduce pathological urinary markers (e.g., proteinuria)
* Potentially counter early hypertension and metabolic disorders
  (These actions are *not established clinical effects* in regulatory pharmacology studies.) ([NootropicsBase.com][1])

### **Scientific Evidence Status**

* No well-designed clinical pharmacology studies (e.g., Phase I/II PK/PD or controlled trials) are available for Renisamin in indexed biomedical literature.
* The “peptide bioregulator” class referenced in Russian literature includes other peptides (e.g., thymogen, epithalamin) with limited clinical explorations; however, **this does *not* validate Renisamin’s specific actions.** ([PubMed][2])

---

## **3. Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability, Absorption)**

### **Direct Data for Renisamin**

No reliable, published pharmacokinetic data exist for Renisamin (e.g., half-life, plasma levels, systemic bioavailability). There are *no peer-reviewed PK studies* for this specific product.

### **General Notes on Peptides**

* **Peptide molecules** (complex proteins/nucleoproteins) generally have *poor oral bioavailability* due to degradation in the GI tract and first-pass metabolism unless specifically formulated for absorption. ([scirp.org][3])
* Small endogenous peptides often have **short half-lives** in vivo (minutes to a few hours) unless chemically modified or protected. ([scirp.org][3])
* Oral peptide drugs that *are* bioavailable typically require advanced formulation; Renisamin is not demonstrated to have that property.

→ In absence of data, **no reliable half-life or bioavailability values** (oral, systemic exposure, or metabolites) can be provided for Renisamin.

---

## **4. Dosage & Administration**

### **Common Manufacturer-Recommended Regimens**

For oral administration:

* **1–3 tablets** taken **2–3 times per day**
* Taken **10–15 minutes before meals**
* Typical course: **10–15 days**
* Repeat courses may be taken after **3–6 months**
  These recommendations are *product guidelines from sellers/supplements providers*, not evidence-based clinical dosing. ([NootropicsBase.com][1])

### **Safe Range vs. Effective Dose**

* There are **no clinical trials** establishing a *minimum effective dose* or *maximum safe dose* validated by pharmacodynamic responses.
* These dosing suggestions should be interpreted as *supplement use guidelines*, not medical dosing.

---

## **5. Safety and Side Effects**

### **Manufacturer Statements**

* Claimed to cause *no side effects, no intoxication, no accumulation, and no withdrawal syndrome*. ([NootropicsBase.com][1])

### **Scientific Evidence**

* There are *no published clinical safety studies* for Renisamin.
* Peptide supplements are generally considered *low risk* by some providers, but this does *not guarantee safety*, especially in patients with kidney impairment, autoimmune conditions, or concurrent therapies.

### **Regulatory Status**

* Not evaluated or endorsed by FDA/EMA regulatory agencies as a drug. ([NootropicsBase.com][1])
