### Pharmacological Actions of Compound 7P (CAS 1890208-58-8)

Compound 7P is an experimental nootropic compound primarily studied for its role in promoting neuronal growth and regeneration. Based on available scientific literature and vendor descriptions, its key pharmacological actions include:

- **Promotion of Neurite Outgrowth**: Enhances the extension of neurites (axons and dendrites) in cultured primary neurons derived from the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and retina. This action supports neuronal development and repair in vitro.
- **Induction of Axon Regeneration**: Stimulates the growth of GAP-43-positive axons in vivo, particularly in models of optic nerve injury, translating in vitro neurite outgrowth to actual axon regeneration.
- **Potential Neuroprotection and Cognitive Enhancement**: Vendor claims suggest it improves coordination, elevates mood, combats fatigue, prevents oxidative damage in the brain, and aids in recovery from alcohol-related brain damage. These are likely derived from its neurogenic effects, though not directly substantiated in primary studies.
- **Other Claimed Actions**: Some sources mention selectivity for prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTGIS) over thromboxane synthase, but this appears to be a misattribution from a different "compound 7p" in unrelated literature. The primary actions are neuronal regeneration-related, with no confirmed anti-thromboxane effects for this specific molecule.

No evidence of violent, illegal, or disallowed activities in its use; it is researched for therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative conditions.

### Quantitative Values and Time-Related Influences

Limited quantitative data is available, as compound 7P is not an approved drug and studies are preclinical. Time-related values (e.g., onset, duration) are inferred from pharmacokinetics and study designs. Here's a summary with available metrics:

| Action | Key Quantitative Values | Time-Related Influences | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Neurite Outgrowth (In Vitro) | Effective concentration: 2–20 μM; Optimal: 10 μM.<br>Axon length categories: Increased >50 μm, 50–100 μm, 100–200 μm, >200 μm vs. control (p < 0.05, n=9 fields from 3 experiments).<br>Fold increase (related precursors): ~3-fold at 10–20 μM. | Assayed after 72 hours of exposure.<br>Onset: Visible within hours to days in culture; full effect by 72 h.<br>Duration: Tied to exposure; no persistent effect post-removal noted. | Measured via immunofluorescence (anti-β-III tubulin or anti-neurofilament). No cytotoxicity at these concentrations (viability unchanged, n=3). |
| Axon Regeneration (In Vivo) | Axon extension: At >1500 μm distal to injury: 0.70 ± 0.20 axons (treated) vs. 0.22 ± 0.081 (control) (p < 0.05, n=4 rats, 11–15 sections each).<br>Significant increases at 500, 1000, 1500 μm. | Administered every 4 days for 3 weeks; effects assessed post-treatment (3 weeks).<br>Onset: Likely within days; full regeneration observed after repeated dosing.<br>Duration: Sustained during treatment period; no long-term follow-up. | Optic nerve crush model in rats; GAP-43 immunostaining. |
| Metabolic Stability | 61.2% remaining after 30 min in mouse liver S9 fraction. | Rapid metabolism inferred; improved vs. precursors (0.3–0.7% remaining). | Indicates potential for short systemic exposure. |
| Other Claimed Actions (e.g., Mood Improvement, Anti-Oxidative) | No quantitative values available. | No time-related data; vendor claims imply daily use for ongoing effects. | Marketing-based; not quantified in studies. |

### Half-Life
- Reported half-life: 1–2 hours (based on vendor data; no study confirmation).
- No detailed elimination kinetics; aligns with rapid metabolism observed in liver assays.

### Bioavailabilities
Limited data due to preclinical status and water insolubility (insoluble in water; soluble in ethyl acetate, dichloromethane; slightly soluble in methanol). No route-specific values beyond inferences:
- **Oral Bioavailability**: Not quantified, but likely low due to poor water solubility and rapid metabolism. Vendors claim high purity improves bioavailability, but no numerical values. Oral administration is common in nootropic contexts, with potential for first-pass metabolism reducing systemic exposure.
- **Intravitreal (Ocular)**: Assumed high local bioavailability in eye models (direct injection bypasses systemic barriers), but no systemic PK measured.
- **Other Routes**: No data on intravenous, subcutaneous, or other bioavailabilities. Log P = 2.43 suggests moderate lipophilicity, potentially aiding absorption, but no absolute bioavailability (F) reported.

### Dosages
No human clinical data; all from preclinical studies or vendor suggestions. Compound 7P is sold as a research chemical/nootropic supplement, not for therapeutic use.
- **In Vitro Minimum Effective Dosage**: 2 μM (lowest tested for neurite outgrowth).
- **In Vivo Dosage (Animal Model)**: 0.22 μg per eye (in 5 μL vehicle; ~0.001 mg/kg for 200–250 g rats), intravitreal injection every 4 days for 3 weeks.
- **Human Dosages (Unofficial/No Data)**: No approved dosages. Vendors imply oral use (e.g., as powder), but no specific recommendations. Minimum effective or safe range unknown; preclinical data suggests low μg ranges for local effects.
- **Safe Range**: No toxic side effects reported within tested ranges (2–20 μM in vitro; 0.22 μg/eye in vivo). No LD50 or chronic toxicity data. Vendors claim "no toxic side effects within dosage range," but undefined.
- **Minimum Effective Dosage**: ~2 μM in vitro; scaled animal equivalent ~0.001 mg/kg (local). For oral human use, speculative (e.g., 10–50 mg based on nootropic patterns, but unverified).

Additional optimization is needed for clinical translation, as mechanism remains unclear and PK data is sparse.
