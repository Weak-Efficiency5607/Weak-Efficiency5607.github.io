I **couldn’t find credible, detailed scientific or clinical pharmacological data on something called “peptide complex A-7” as a defined pharmacological agent** in the published literature or regulatory sources. There **is no recognized therapeutic peptide with that exact name in established research or drug databases**; no published values for human pharmacological actions, half-life, bioavailability, dosages, LD₅₀, or safety thresholds were available in the searches I conducted.

Here’s what the searches *did* reveal — which may help clarify **what you might be referring to** and what *cannot* be provided because of lack of data:

---

## 🧬 1. There *is* an investigational peptide known as **A7R**

* The **A7R peptide** is a short heptapeptide (7-amino-acid peptide) that **binds to neuropilin-1 (NRP-1)** and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), blocking VEGF165-mediated angiogenesis in cancer models, and has been studied in experimental oncology for **anti-angiogenic and tumor-targeting purposes**. ([PMC][1])

**Pharmacological actions reported in research (preclinical):**

* **Anti-angiogenic:** competes with VEGF165 for NRP-1/VEGFR2 binding, *reducing angiogenesis and tumor growth* in animal models. ([PMC][1])
* **Tumor vasculature alteration:** may “normalize” chaotic tumor blood vessels in some models. ([cell.com][2])

**Key points:**

* A7R’s effects are *mechanistic/targeted* (blocking growth factor signaling), not general systemic pharmacology.
* It is *not* an approved drug — characterization is limited to experimental models.

🛑 **What is *not* available in the literature that you asked for:**

* **Half-life in blood or tissues**
* **Bioavailability via oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, or other routes**
* **Dosage regimens**
* **Minimum effective dose, safe range, maximum tolerated dose**
* **LD₅₀ or toxicity thresholds**

No controlled human or animal PK/PD studies with quantitative pharmacokinetic values are published for A7R. These parameters simply don’t exist in established literature for this peptide.

## ⚠️ 2. Other A-7 or A7-named peptides are different

There are *other research peptides* with “A7” in their name but **not the same thing**:

### 🧪 7-amino-acid peptides (e.g., 7P)

* A 7-amino-acid sequence studied for **anti-inflammatory effects in mouse asthma models** (reduced Th2 cytokines, reduced airway hyperresponsiveness). ([PubMed][3])
* This is a different sequence and was examined only in preclinical disease models.

### 🧬 A7-1 peptide in wound healing

* A synthetic peptide tested in mice for **accelerating wound and skin graft healing**, but *no systemic pharmacokinetic or safety profile* is available. ([link.springer.com][4])

None of these are standardized therapeutic agents with regulatory approval.

---

## 🧪 Why there’s *no pharmacological profile* available

Peptides like A7R are studied mainly **as experimental tools or targeting ligands** in laboratory research:

* Peptides without modifications are rapidly degraded by proteases in blood and the digestive tract, leading to very **short half-lives and poor oral bioavailability**. This is a well-known issue for peptides generally. ([sciencedirect.com][5])
* Detailed toxicology (LD₅₀), bioavailability, and dosage profiles are typically determined **only in drug development programs** under regulatory studies — these have *not been published* for A7R or “A-7” complexes.

---

## 🔍 General remarks on peptide pharmacology (relevant but *not specific* to A7R)

**Pharmacokinetic tendencies of small peptides:**

* **Half-life:** Many unmodified peptides are cleared within minutes to a few hours in blood. ([peptiderecon.com][6])
* **Bioavailability:**

  * Oral: very poor due to gastric/intestinal degradation. ([sciencedirect.com][5])
  * Parenteral (e.g., IV or subcutaneous): higher systemic exposure, but still short unless engineered. ([peptiderecon.com][7])

These general rules explain *why specific PK values for A7R aren’t published* — its unmodified form likely would have very limited systemic bioavailability and a short half-life, but the exact values are not established.

## 🧫 Summary

| Parameter                    | **Data available?**              | Notes                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pharmacological actions      | ✕ (for A-7 complex specifically) | Only A7R actions known in research        |
| Time-course/PK values        | ✕                                | No published half-life, Tmax, Cmax        |

| Dosage & safe range          | ✕                                | No clinical dosing data                   |
| Minimum effective dose       | ✕                                | Only context-dependent experimental doses |
| LD₅₀ / toxicity              | ✕                                | No formal toxicity studies published      |

**Conclusion:** There is **no complete pharmacological profile published** for a “peptide complex A-7” that meets your requested depth. The closest relevant scientific subject — **A7R peptide** — is an experimental antiangiogenic peptide studied in preclinical cancer research, and *quantitative pharmacokinetics/toxicology data aren’t available in the literature*. ([PMC][1])

If you can provide more context — for example, whether “A-7” refers to a *specific sequence, brand, research peptide, or therapeutic candidate* you saw in a study — I might be able to help locate more targeted information or clarify terminology.
