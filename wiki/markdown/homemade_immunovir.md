Homemade "Immunovir" is a concept based on an attempt to recreate the effects of *Inosine pranobex*, a compound that was originally marketed under the brand name Immunovir. Inosine pranobex has been used in some countries as an immune-stimulating drug, often for the treatment of viral infections and immune-related conditions, though its effectiveness and availability vary worldwide.

### Key Components: Inosine and DMAE

The core idea of homemade "Immunovir" typically involves combining *inosine* and *DMAE* (Dimethylaminoethanol), two components that, while they have some related properties, do not fully replicate the activity of the original drug.

1. **Inosine**: This is a nucleoside that the body can convert into various substances important for cell function. It has been used as a supplement for athletic performance and brain function, with some immune-enhancing properties.
2. **DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol)**: DMAE is a compound sometimes used as a nootropic (cognitive enhancer). It is naturally found in small amounts in the human brain and in some foods, and is believed to promote acetylcholine production, benefiting mood and cognitive functions. Its effects on the immune system are, however, indirect and limited.

### Mechanism of Action of Real Inosine Pranobex

Inosine pranobex is an immunomodulator that is thought to work by:

* Enhancing lymphocyte activity, particularly T-lymphocytes.
* Increasing the production of cytokines like interferon-gamma and interleukins, which help combat viruses.
* Potentially increasing antibody production.

Inosine pranobex combines inosine with another component, *N,N-dimethylamino-2-propanol p-acetamidobenzoate*, which isn’t the same as DMAE and plays a specific role in its immune-stimulating properties.

### Challenges with Homemade "Immunovir"

Combining inosine and DMAE does not replicate the mechanism of Inosine pranobex:

* **Limited Immunomodulatory Effects**: While inosine may support cellular energy and metabolic processes, it does not by itself provide the same immune cell activation or cytokine production as the original drug.
* **DMAE's Role**: DMAE does not have a clear effect on immune function, and its impact on brain health or mood may vary significantly from person to person.

### Potential Risks

* **Dosage and Side Effects**: Dosage can be hard to standardize without professional oversight. Inosine, for example, has been associated with increased uric acid levels, potentially leading to gout or kidney stones if used in high amounts or over long periods.
* **Ineffectiveness**: Because inosine and DMAE do not fully mimic the effects of Inosine pranobex, the resulting mixture may not provide the desired immune benefits, and it lacks clinical backing for immune support.

### Summary

Homemade "Immunovir" using inosine and DMAE may not effectively stimulate the immune system and does not fully replicate the properties of Inosine pranobex. If immune support is needed, it’s generally safer and more effective to consult a healthcare provider to discuss clinically validated supplements or medications rather than relying on untested homemade formulations.
