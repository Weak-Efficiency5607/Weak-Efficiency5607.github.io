Here’s a **comprehensive summary** of the **pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, and dosage/administration information** for two different substances that your description might be referring to:

1. **Tiramin (thyroid bioregulator; complex of proteins and nucleoproteins)** — *a peptide/nucleoprotein product marketed as a “bioregulator” of thyroid function* (not a standard approved pharmaceutical in major regulatory jurisdictions such as FDA/EMA). ([Nzt lab][1])
2. **Tyramine** — *a well-studied endogenous/food-derived trace amine with known pharmacology* (often confused with “Tiramin” due to the similar name, but pharmacologically quite different). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])

Below, these substances are **distinctly described** with all available data.

---

## **1) Tiramin — Thyroid Bioregulator (Proteins & Nucleoproteins)**

### **What It Is**

* A **complex of proteins and nucleoproteins obtained from animal thyroid tissue**, often sold as a **thyroid bioregulator or peptide supplement**. ([Nzt lab][1])
* Marketed claims suggest **selective action on thyroid cells**, promoting restoration and improving thyroid function. ([rupharma.com][3])
* **Not recognized as an approved drug** by major regulatory agencies; available largely as a **nutritional or peptide supplement**. Sufficient high-quality clinical pharmacology data in rigorous scientific literature are *not available*. ([peptide-products.com][4])

---

### **Pharmacological Actions (Claims)**

**Advertised / Reported Effects (based on product descriptions and small clinical reports):**

* Tissue-specific regulatory effect on thyroid gland cells. ([peptide-products.com][4])
* Improves cellular metabolism in thyroid tissues. ([peptide-products.com][4])
* Helps normalize thyroid hormone production. ([peptide-products.com][4])
* Promotes recovery of damaged thyroid cells. ([peptide-products.com][4])

**Clinical Observations (limited, low-level evidence):**

* Improvements in laboratory and instrumental indices of thyroid function in some hypothyroid patients. ([RxEli][5])
* Increased work capacity, decreased headaches, and normalization of ECG parameters reported in small case series. ([RxEli][5])

⚠️ **Important:** These actions come from **small open-label / non-controlled studies or vendor materials**, not from large, peer-reviewed pharmacological trials. There is **no well-defined receptor mechanism, half-life data, or bioavailability data** in mainstream scientific literature.

---

### **Pharmacokinetics (Not Scientifically Established)**

* **Absorption / Bioavailability:** Not well documented in peer-reviewed pharmacology sources.
* **Half-Life:** No rigorous data available.
* Lacking standard pharmacokinetic measures such as *Tmax*, *Cmax*, *AUC*, *clearance*, etc.

**Reason:** Tiramin is a **biological peptide supplement**, not a standardized pharmacological compound studied in formal PK/PD trials. These products often degrade in the gastrointestinal tract unless specially formulated for peptide delivery.

---

### **Dosing & Administration (Based on Product Labels)**

**Typical dosing recommendations found in product information:**

* **Dose:** 1–3 tablets, **2–3 times per day**. ([rupharma.com][3])
* **Timing:** 10–20 minutes before meals. ([rupharma.com][3])
* **Course:** 10–14 days typical; repeated courses every 3–6 months. ([rupharma.com][3])
* **Form:** Oral tablets/capsules. ([peptide-products.com][4])

**Safety:**

* Manufacturer claims *no reported side effects or accumulation*, but **no formal safety trials or half-life data exist**. ([peptide-products.com][4])
* Safety and efficacy have **not been verified by major regulatory bodies**.

---

## **2) Tyramine — Endogenous Trace Amine (Well-Studied)**

> *Not to be confused with Tiramin; tyramine is a known pharmacological agent formed by decarboxylation of tyrosine.* ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])

### **Mechanism of Action**

* **Indirect sympathomimetic:** displaces norepinephrine from nerve terminals, raising heart rate and blood pressure. ([tmedweb.tulane.edu][6])
* Substrate for **monoamine oxidase (MAO-A)**; rapidly deaminated in gut/liver. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])
* Activates **trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs)** with unclear broader neuromodulatory effects. ([go.drugbank.com][7])

---

### **Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**

* Readily absorbed from GI tract. ([rivm.nl][8])

**Bioavailability:**

* Very **low oral bioavailability** due to extensive first-pass MAO metabolism; likely **<1% systemic exposure** under normal conditions. ([PMC][9])

**Time to Peak:**

* *Tmax* varies widely (approximately **13–120 minutes**). ([PMC][9])

**Half-Life:**

* Terminal half-life ~ **55 minutes (25–124 min range)** after oral dose. ([PMC][9])
* Earlier controlled study found ~ **0.53 hours (~32 min)** in fasted subjects. ([PubMed][10])

**Clearance:**

* High apparent clearance (e.g., CL/F ~ **107 L/min**) due to first-pass effect. ([PMC][9])

**Metabolism:**

* Oxidative deamination by MAO-A → **4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (major metabolite)**. ([PMC][9])

**Excretion:**

* Metabolites recovered in urine (majority as 4-HPAA). ([PMC][9])

---

### **Pharmacodynamics**

* **Pressor response:** Increased blood pressure via norepinephrine release. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])
* **Cardiovascular changes:** Elevated systolic BP correlates with systemic tyramine concentration. ([PMC][9])

---

### **Dosing & Clinical Considerations**

* **Not used therapeutically** as a drug in modern medicine.
* Exogenous tyramine ingestion poses risk particularly with **MAO inhibitors** (cheese effect). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])
* **Dietary intake thresholds:** ~10–25 mg tyramine with MAO inhibitors can trigger hypertensive episodes. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])

## **Key Caveats**

* **Tiramin lacks high-quality pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data** in peer-reviewed clinical pharmacology literature.
* Much of what exists for Tiramin comes from **vendor/product claims and small clinical case reports**, not controlled trials. ([peptide-products.com][4])
* Tyramine is scientifically characterized but **not used as a therapeutic drug**; its pharmacology is relevant mainly in drug interactions and toxicology. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2])
