Here’s a **comprehensive scientific summary** of what is known *from published research (preclinical and early mechanistic studies)* about the **peptide “A-11”** (often described as an ANXA1-derived or angiopoietin-interacting peptide). Unfortunately, there are **no established clinical pharmacokinetics, human half-life or approved dosing regimens** because this peptide has **not been developed as a regulated drug** — only investigated in research settings. Therefore, most parameters like oral bioavailability, human half-life, safe dose range, or minimum effective dose **are not defined in humans**.

## 🧬 1. **Identity & Mechanism (Pharmacological Actions)**

**A11 Peptide**

* A short peptide (11 amino acids) derived from **Annexin A1 (ANXA1)** or identified from angiopoietin segments, depending on context. ([biocat.com][1])

**Primary reported actions (preclinical):**

1. **Anti-angiogenic activity**

   * Binds to angiopoietins and **inhibits Ang-2 binding to the Tie2 receptor**, reducing endothelial cell migration and vessel formation. ([PubMed][2])

2. **Tumor vascular inhibition / reduced vascular density**

   * Demonstrated in tumour and retinal neovascularization animal models. ([PubMed][2])

3. **Inhibition of EphA2/ANXA1 interaction**

   * Blocks ANXA1 attachment to EphA2, increases EphA2 ubiquitination, internalization and degradation, suppressing nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. ([biocat.com][1])

4. **Reduced tumour immune evasion via PD-L1 degradation**

   * Binds PD-L1, enhances its ubiquitination and degradation — boosting T-cell anti-tumour activity (in vitro & mouse studies). ([PubMed][3])

5. **Enhanced radiosensitivity in tumours**

   * Decreases EphA2 signalling related to radioresistance (preclinical). ([PubMed][4])

💡 **Mechanistic summary:**
A11 modulates key signalling pathways including Ang-Tie2, EphA2, and PD-L1/USP7, affecting angiogenesis, tumour cell survival, immune response and potentially sensitivity to therapies. All evidence so far is from **cell and animal models**. ([PubMed][2])

## 📊 2. **Pharmacologic Metrics (Time-Linked Effects)**

**Time courses and kinetic data from published research are scarce and mostly qualitative:**

* There are **no human half-life measurements published** for A11.
* Typical results in vitro/in vivo show **activity measured over hours to days** in angiogenesis assays and tumor suppression models. ([PubMed][2])

**Experimental time frames reported (examples):**

* In anti-angiogenic assays, effects were measurable within **hours to days** in cells or chick/mouse models. ([PubMed][2])
* Tumour volume reduction observed over **weeks in xenograft models**. ([PubMed][2])

**Inferences on peptide stability:**

* Unmodified small peptides generally have **short plasma half-lives (minutes to hours)** due to rapid proteolysis and renal clearance unless modified or delivered via a protected vehicle, based on general peptide pharmacology principles. ([peptiderecon.com][5])

🧪 *But specifically for A11,* no peer-reviewed half-life or plasma stability data have been published.

## 📈 3. **Bioavailability & Routes of Administration**

There are **no published clinical studies** reporting:

* oral bioavailability
* subcutaneous or intravenous bioavailability
* human pharmacokinetic profiles

**General peptide pharmacology context (not specific to A11):**
Therapeutic peptides are usually:

* **poorly bioavailable orally** due to degradation in the GI tract,
* typically administered **parenterally** (e.g., subcutaneous or intravenous),
* and can have **substantial variability in absorption and half-life** without modification. ([peptiderecon.com][5])

So, **oral bioavailability of native A11 is likely very low** and not characterized.

---

## 💊 4. **Dosage & Safety**

There are **no approved or standard clinical doses** for A11. All investigations are **preclinical**, typically using:

* **micromolar concentrations in cell cultures**,
* **mg/kg ranges in animal models** (not systematically documented).

Safety data are generally **only from animal models or in vitro**. No formal toxicology, safe range or maximum tolerated dose has been defined in humans.

## ⚠️ Key Limitations

1. **No clinical pharmacokinetics or dosing approved**

   * All available A11 information comes from **research settings**, not pharmaceutical development.

2. **No human safety or regulatory data**

3. **No standardized potency or effectiveness studies across models**

4. **Terminology confusion**

   * “A11” may refer to different peptides in different research contexts (e.g., ANXA1-derived versus angiopoietin-derived) — these are mechanistically distinct. ([PubMed][2])
