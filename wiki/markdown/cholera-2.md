### Symptoms of Cholera

Cholera, caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, is often **asymptomatic** or mild in the majority of infected people. Approximately 75–95% of those infected show no symptoms or only mild diarrhea (estimates vary by outbreak and population immunity), while only about 5–20% develop noticeable illness, and 1–5% of all infected (or ~10–20% of symptomatic cases) progress to severe disease if untreated.

When symptoms occur (typically 12 hours to 5 days after infection), they result primarily from toxin-induced fluid loss in the intestines. The hallmark is acute watery diarrhea, often described as "rice-water stool" (pale, milky, odorless, with flecks like rice). Below is a list of the main symptoms in **symptomatic patients** (those with clinical cholera), along with how commonly they occur based on clinical data from outbreaks, WHO/CDC reports, and studies (e.g., confirmed cases in endemic areas):

| Symptom                          | Description                                                                 | Frequency in Symptomatic Patients                  |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Watery diarrhea**             | Profuse, painless, non-bloody diarrhea; can exceed 1 liter/hour in severe cases, leading to rapid fluid loss. | Nearly universal (close to 100%) – the defining symptom of clinical cholera. |
| **Vomiting**                    | Often early-onset, with clear fluid; worsens fluid loss.                    | Very common (70–90%, often ~80% in outbreak studies). |
| **Dehydration signs**           | Includes thirst, dry mouth/mucous membranes, sunken eyes, reduced urine output, weakness, and loss of skin elasticity (skin "tents" when pinched). | Common and progressive (50–90%, depending on severity; present in virtually all untreated severe cases). |
| **Muscle/leg cramps**           | Painful cramps, especially in legs, due to electrolyte loss (sodium, potassium). | Common (50–80% in many reports; higher in dehydrated patients). |
| **Abdominal pain/cramps**       | Mild discomfort or cramping (diarrhea is usually painless).                | Less common (30–70%, varies by study; e.g., ~67% in one African outbreak). |
| **Nausea**                      | Feeling of sickness, often accompanying vomiting.                          | Common (50–80%, usually with vomiting).            |
| **Rapid heart rate (tachycardia) and low blood pressure** | Signs of shock from volume loss.                                            | Common in moderate-to-severe cases (50–80%).       |
| **Shock or lethargy**           | Extreme dehydration leading to confusion, cold/clammy skin, or collapse.   | Less common overall (10–20% if untreated; defines severe "cholera gravis"). |

**Rare or uncommon features**:
- Fever (uncommon; <10–20%, and if present, may suggest co-infection).
- Bloody diarrhea or severe abdominal pain (very rare; suggests another cause).

In severe cases, untreated patients can lose 10–20% of body weight in hours, leading to death in 50–60% without rehydration (mortality drops to <1% with prompt oral/intravenous fluids). Symptoms resolve quickly with treatment, often within days.

If you experience these symptoms (especially profuse diarrhea) after travel to an endemic area or consuming contaminated water/food, seek immediate medical care for rehydration. Sources: WHO fact sheet (2024), CDC cholera pages (2025 updates), Mayo Clinic, and clinical studies from outbreaks.
