Cholera, caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, leads to symptoms that vary widely in severity. Most infected people (75–90%) remain **asymptomatic** or experience only mild symptoms, while 10–20% develop acute watery diarrhea, and 5–10% progress to severe, life-threatening disease with rapid fluid loss if untreated.

Symptomatic cases typically start 12 hours to 5 days after infection. The hallmark is sudden, profuse, painless watery diarrhea (often "rice-water" stool). Below is a list of recognized symptoms with their approximate prevalence or presence in symptomatic cases (primarily drawn from severe or clinically significant infections, as mild cases may only have minimal diarrhea).

### Common Symptoms and Prevalence
- **Watery diarrhea (profuse, rice-water-like stools)**: Present in **virtually 100%** of symptomatic cases; the defining and most consistent symptom.
- **Vomiting (often forceful and frequent early on)**: Very common, present in **70–90%** of symptomatic cases (especially severe ones); may occur with or after diarrhea starts.
- **Leg/muscle cramps (due to electrolyte loss)**: Common in moderate to severe cases, affecting **50–80%**; results from rapid loss of salts like potassium and sodium.
- **Signs of dehydration** (thirst, dry mouth/throat, sunken eyes, reduced skin turgor, low urine output, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure): Develop in nearly **100%** of moderate-to-severe untreated cases; severity correlates directly with fluid loss volume.
- **Nausea**: Common but less universal, present in **50–70%**; usually precedes or accompanies vomiting.
- **Restlessness, irritability, or fatigue** (early dehydration signs, especially in children): Present in **30–60%** of dehydrating cases; reflects hypovolemia (low blood volume).
- **Abdominal discomfort/cramping**: Mild or absent in most cases (painless diarrhea is classic); when present, affects **<30%**.
- **Fever**: Rare (cholera is usually afebrile); occurs in **<10%**.
- **Altered mental status** (lethargy, confusion, or coma in extreme shock): Occurs only in very severe, untreated dehydration (**<5–10%** of all cases if prompt care is delayed).

### Anhedonia
**Anhedonia** (inability to feel pleasure, a psychiatric symptom often linked to depression or other mental health conditions): **Not present (0%)** as a symptom of cholera. Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infection that does not directly affect brain chemistry or cause psychiatric symptoms like anhedonia. In severe dehydration, patients may become irritable, lethargic, or confused, but these are physiological effects of shock/hypovolemia, not anhedonia. No medical authority (CDC, WHO, Mayo Clinic, etc.) lists anhedonia or any similar psychiatric symptom as part of cholera.

Rapid rehydration (oral or IV) resolves symptoms quickly in most cases when treatment is prompt. If you suspect cholera, seek immediate medical care.
