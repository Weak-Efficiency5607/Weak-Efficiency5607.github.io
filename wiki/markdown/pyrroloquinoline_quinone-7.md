Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) does induce downregulations in the pathways previously discussed, as confirmed by multiple preclinical studies (primarily in rodent and cell-based models of inflammation, oxidative stress, atrophy, and metabolic disorders). These effects are generally beneficial, targeting proinflammatory and stress responses without evidence of long-term harm in healthy systems. Below, I verify the presence of these downregulations based on available evidence, including persistence after discontinuation. Estimates of likelihood remain similar to prior assessments (high during use, moderate beneficial persistence in early-life models, low adverse persistence in adults), but are now substantiated by specific studies.

### Verified Downregulations in Key Pathways
Evidence supports PQQ's role in downregulating these pathways, often via antioxidant mechanisms that reduce ROS and inhibit upstream activators. Most data come from in vitro and in vivo animal models; human studies are limited but align with anti-inflammatory benefits.

1. **NF-κB Pathway**:
   - **Confirmed**: Yes, PQQ consistently downregulates NF-κB activation, nuclear translocation of p65, and downstream proinflammatory genes (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2). This occurs in models of LPS-induced inflammation in microglia, cardiac hypertrophy, renal senescence, and obesity.
   - **Examples**: In LPS-treated microglia, PQQ (1–10 μM) reduces NO/PGE2 production and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. In isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, PQQ (10–100 μM) inhibits NF-κB nuclear entry. In obese mice, early-life PQQ lowers hepatic NOS2, NLRP3, IL-6, and PTGS2 expression.
   - **Likelihood**: High (85–95% in stress models); dose-dependent (e.g., 100 nM in cells, 2–5 mg/kg in animals).

2. **MAPK Pathways (JNK/p38/ERK)**:
   - **Confirmed**: Yes, PQQ downregulates phosphorylated JNK and p38 in inflammation and atrophy models, reducing apoptosis and catabolism. Effects on ERK vary: upregulation in some (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis), downregulation in others (e.g., neuronal cells).
   - **Examples**: In denervated muscle atrophy, PQQ (5 mg/kg/day) suppresses JNK/p38 phosphorylation. In LPS models, it dephosphorylates p38/JNK. In cancer cells, PQQ alters ERK2 levels to induce apoptosis.
   - **Likelihood**: High (80–90% in inflammatory models); context-specific for ERK.

3. **JAK/STAT Pathway**:
   - **Confirmed**: Yes, PQQ downregulates JAK2/STAT3 activation in atrophy and allergic models, reducing proliferation and inflammation. It modulates phosphorylation of STAT1/3/6 while promoting STAT4.
   - **Examples**: In denervated atrophy, PQQ (5 mg/kg/day) inhibits JAK2/STAT3. In allergic airway inflammation, it suppresses STAT1/3/6 phosphorylation.
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate to high (70–85%); often linked to anti-inflammatory effects.

4. **TGF-β/Smad Pathway**:
   - **Confirmed**: Yes, PQQ downregulates TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling, reducing fibrosis and apoptosis in atrophy models.
   - **Examples**: In sciatic nerve transection models, PQQ (5 mg/kg/day) decreases TGF-β1 and p-Smad3, attenuating fibrosis.
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate (60–80%); primarily in fibrosis/atrophy contexts.

5. **Other Downregulations**:
   - **Apoptotic/Senescence Pathways**: Confirmed; PQQ downregulates p16/p21 in senescence models and Bcl-2 in cancer cells (pro-apoptotic there, but protective in healthy cells).
   - **CUL3**: Confirmed in sepsis models; PQQ downregulates CUL3 to reduce apoptosis.

### Persistence After Discontinuation
- **Beneficial Persistence**: Confirmed in early-life models; e.g., prenatal/lactation PQQ in obese mice leads to sustained downregulation of proinflammatory genes (NOS2, NLRP3, IL-6, PTGS2) and reduced hepatic inflammation/lipotoxicity into adulthood, even after weaning withdrawal. In adult models, effects like reduced inflammation reverse within days–weeks (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis reverts in 1–2 days in rats).
- **Adverse Persistence**: Not confirmed; no studies show harmful long-term downregulations post-withdrawal. Temporary fatigue/anxiety in anecdotal reports may occur due to reversal of stimulatory effects, but clinical trials (up to 12 weeks) report no persistent issues. Safety is high; no toxicity in long-term animal studies.
- **Likelihood**: Beneficial persistence moderate (50–70%) in developmental models; low (10–20%) adverse in adults.

In summary, these downregulations are well-supported and protective. Human data are emerging but promising; consult a professional for use.
