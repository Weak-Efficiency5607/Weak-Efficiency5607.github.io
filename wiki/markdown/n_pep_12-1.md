### Pharmacological Actions of N-PEP-12
N-PEP-12 is a proprietary peptide-based dietary supplement derived from enzymatically digested porcine brain proteins (similar to Cerebrolysin). It consists of neuropeptides and amino acids, and is marketed under names like Cebrium or Memoprove. It is primarily used for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement, particularly in aging, memory impairment, and post-stroke recovery. Below is a comprehensive list of its reported pharmacological actions, based on available preclinical and clinical data. Where possible, quantitative values (e.g., time courses, effect sizes) are provided to illustrate influence. Note that N-PEP-12 is a mixture, not a single compound, so some actions may vary by component or model. Data is drawn from cell culture, animal studies, and human trials.

#### 1. **Neuroprotection Against Neuronal Lesions**
   - **Description**: Protects cortical neurons from age-related and disease-associated damage, including metabolic stress, hypoxia, ischemia, and neurodegenerative events. Prevents neuronal cell death in models mimicking aging, ischemic stroke, and other neurological disorders.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - Dose-dependent effect in neuronal cell cultures: Neuroprotection observed across various lesion models (e.g., beta-amyloid toxicity, oxidative stress). Effect size increases with dose and recovery time post-lesion; stronger protection with longer recovery periods (e.g., 24–72 hours post-exposure) and higher initial lesion severity.
     - In vivo: In aged rats, 3 months of daily oral treatment prevents brain aging-related neuronal loss.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Dose-dependent in vitro (effective at low micromolar concentrations, e.g., 1–10 µg/mL equivalents); effect magnitude varies by lesion extent (e.g., 20–50% reduction in cell death depending on model).

#### 2. **Cognitive Enhancement and Memory Improvement**
   - **Description**: Enhances memory performance, particularly in age-related cognitive decline and post-stroke impairment. Improves recall, learning, and overall cognitive function.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - In healthy elderly humans: Single 180 mg oral dose improves memory subtest performance at 6 hours post-administration.
     - In older adults with subjective memory complaints: 30 days of 90 mg daily dosing significantly improves memory impairment.
     - In post-ischemic stroke patients: 90 days of 90 mg daily enhances neurorecovery (e.g., better scores on MoCA, HADS Anxiety, Color Trails 1 tests at day 90). Extended 360 days of 90 mg daily supports sustained cognitive recovery (e.g., improved neuropsychological performance).
     - In aged rats: 3 months daily gavage improves cognitive performance in behavioral tests.
   - **Quantitative Values**: In human trials, effect sizes include borderline intermediate (Cohen's d = 0.491 for MoCA at 90 days), small-to-intermediate (d = 0.424 for anxiety reduction, d = 0.481 for attention tasks). Odds ratios for improvement: 2.436 (MoCA), 2.157 (anxiety), 2.3927 (attention). In some tests, intermediate effects favor control (d = 0.501 for symbol search errors).

#### 3. **Activation of Brain Bioelectrical Activity**
   - **Description**: Modulates EEG patterns to support brain function, potentially aiding alertness and cognition.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - In healthy elderly: Single 180 mg oral dose increases relative alpha-activity power and decreases slow delta-activity at 6 hours post-administration.
     - Sustained effects in cognitive trials align with 6-hour onset for acute changes.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Significant increase (p < 0.05) in alpha power (~10–20% relative enhancement) and generalized delta decrease at 6 hours.

#### 4. **Increase in Synaptic Density**
   - **Description**: Promotes synaptic plasticity, which may underlie cognitive benefits.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - In aged rats: 3 months daily oral treatment increases synaptic density, correlating with improved cognitive performance.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Not quantified precisely, but aligns with behavioral improvements over chronic dosing.

#### 5. **Amelioration of Endothelial Dysfunction**
   - **Description**: Reduces vascular issues associated with aging, potentially supporting brain health indirectly.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - In aged rats: 10 weeks of 60 mg/kg daily gavage ameliorates endothelial dysfunction.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Partial reduction in dysfunction markers; not directly quantified in humans.

#### 6. **Stimulation of Neurite Outgrowth and Neuronal Survival**
   - **Description**: Shares properties with natural peptide growth factors, enhancing neuronal repair and survival under stress.
   - **Influence and Time Courses**:
     - In cell cultures: Dose-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth and protection against metabolic stress; effects build over hours to days.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Effective in low doses (e.g., similar to growth factors at 1–10 µg/mL).

### Half-Life
- No formal half-life has been established for N-PEP-12 in humans or animals, as it is a peptide mixture with variable components. Pharmacokinetic studies are limited, and half-life is not reported in available literature. In general, for oral peptide preparations, half-lives can range from minutes to hours due to enzymatic degradation, but N-PEP-12's design (stabilized peptides) suggests longer persistence, as evidenced by effects lasting 6+ hours post-dose and chronic benefits over months.

### Bioavailabilities
- **Oral Route**: N-PEP-12 is described as orally bioavailable, with absorption confirmed by neurobehavioral effects, cognitive responses, and brain distribution in rats (e.g., radiolabeled 125I N-PEP-12 reaches brain after gavage). However, no specific percentage is reported. General peptide bioavailability is low (often 1–2% due to GI degradation and poor permeability), but N-PEP-12's formulation (enzymatically derived for stability) enhances it sufficiently for clinical effects. No data on fasted vs. fed states or comparisons to other routes.
- **Other Routes**: Primarily oral; no comparative data for IV or other administrations. In rats, gavage shows distribution to brain, indicating systemic availability.
- No absolute or relative bioavailability values (e.g., F%) are available; estimates for similar peptides suggest <10%, but N-PEP-12's effects imply functional bioavailability.

### Dosages
- **Standard Dosage**: 90 mg once daily (oral capsule, e.g., Cebrium brand) for chronic use in cognitive support, post-stroke recovery, or age-related memory issues.
- **Single Dose in Studies**: 180 mg (acute effects on EEG and memory at 6 hours).
- **Minimum Effective Dose**: 90 mg daily appears to be the minimum based on human trials showing benefits at this level. In cell culture, lower equivalents (e.g., 1–10 µg/mL) are neuroprotective, but human translation is unclear. In rats, 60 mg/kg daily (roughly 500–700 mg human equivalent, adjusted for body surface area) was effective for endothelial effects.
- **Safe Range**: 90–180 mg in human studies, with no adverse effects reported. Extended use (up to 360 days at 90 mg) was well-tolerated in post-stroke patients. No upper tolerable limit defined, but as a supplement, it lacks formal toxicity data; general peptide safety suggests low risk at these doses. No serious side effects noted in trials (e.g., no drug interactions or contraindications reported).

Note: Data is limited due to N-PEP-12's status as a dietary supplement rather than a regulated drug. Most values come from small clinical trials (n=50–106) and preclinical models. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized use, as individual responses may vary.
