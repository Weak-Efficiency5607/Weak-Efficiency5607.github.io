Based on scientific studies, oral NMN supplementation does not appear to downregulate nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression. In fact, some research indicates it can upregulate or restore NAMPT levels in certain contexts, such as during oxidative stress or inflammation, while other studies show no significant effect on NAMPT. However, NMN can downregulate other biological productions in the body, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β), inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB p65), and profibrogenic genes. These effects are often linked to NMN's role in boosting NAD+ levels, which supports anti-inflammatory and anti-aging processes.
