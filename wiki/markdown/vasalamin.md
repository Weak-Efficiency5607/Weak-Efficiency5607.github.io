Here’s a **comprehensive, evidence-based summary** of what is *known* (and *not reliably known*) about **Vasalamin** — a marketed peptide/protein-nucleoprotein complex said to act on blood vessels. Unfortunately, **there is no high-quality clinical or pharmacokinetic data in the medical literature or official drug registries** detailing precise pharmacological mechanisms, half-life, bioavailability, or safety/efficacy parameters. What *does* exist about Vasalamin comes from **supplement vendors or product descriptions**, not from peer-reviewed pharmacology or regulatory assessments. I’ve clearly separated the *actual evidence* from *marketing claims* below.

---

## 🧬 What Vasalamin *is*

**Vasalamin** is described commercially as:
• A complex of proteins and **nucleoproteins** derived from the blood vessels of animals (cattle/pigs). ([RUPharma][1])
• Mainly sold as **oral tablets or capsules** (≈155 mg/tablet; ≈10 mg peptide/protein complex per tablet). ([Peptide Shop][2])

⚠️ **Important:** Vasalamin is **not an approved pharmaceutical medication** in regulated markets (e.g., EMA, FDA, MHRA) and does not have recognized pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles in scientific publications. Regulatory evaluation (safety, efficacy, PK/PD) by major agencies is not available. ([RUPharma][1])

---

## 🧪 Pharmacological actions (claimed by sellers, *not clinically proven*)

These are **marketing claims** from supplement product descriptions — **not validated pharmacodynamics from human studies**:

### 💡 Claimed actions

1. **Selective support of vascular cells:** Peptides purportedly help vascular cells synthesize essential proteins and **restore damaged cells**. ([RUPharma][1])
2. **Improving microcirculation** (including brain). ([COSMOLL.ORG][3])
3. **Decreases atherosclerotic lesions** of arteries (intra- and extracranial, peripheral). ([peptide-products.com][4])
4. **Increases capillary wall strength**, reduces micro-hemorrhages. ([peptide-products.com][4])
5. **Decreases atherogenic lipoprotein fractions** (claimed). ([peptide-products.com][4])
6. **Restores venous blood flow and reduces microcirculatory disturbances.** ([peptide-products.com][4])

👉 These descriptions use **general physiological language** (e.g., “restores vascular function”) but do **not detail specific receptor targets, molecular mechanisms, or validated pharmacodynamics.** Scholarly pharmacology databases *do not contain peer-reviewed characterizations* of Vasalamin’s pharmacological actions.

---

## 🧪 Pharmacokinetics (Half-life & Bioavailability)

### 🔬 **Half-Life**

There is **no published pharmacokinetic data** showing:

* plasma half-life (t½)
* time to peak concentration (Tmax)
* elimination kinetics

for Vasalamin.

⛔ While peptide drugs often have **short systemic half-lives** due to rapid enzymatic degradation (~minutes to hours) and poor oral absorption, this is a *general property of peptides* — **not specific measured data for Vasalamin**. ([PMC][5])

### 🧪 **Bioavailability**

* **Oral bioavailability is *unknown*** — commercial descriptions imply oral tablets are effective, but **no clinical studies report systemic absorption or pharmacokinetics**. ([RUPharma][1])
* General peptide science shows that **oral bioavailability of peptides is usually very low (<2%)** due to proteolytic degradation and poor intestinal absorption. ([PMC][5])

👉 Without formal studies, any numeric claim for Vasalamin’s systemic exposure *cannot be provided*.

---

## 💊 Dosage

Available product literature (not clinical guidelines):

### 📌 Oral (tablet/capsule)

* **1–3 tablets**, **2–3 times per day**, **10–15 min before meals**. ([RUPharma][1])
* Typical **course duration:** 10–15 days. ([RUPharma][1])
* **Repeat courses** suggested every **3–6 months**. ([RUPharma][1])

💡 One tablet typically contains ~0.01 g (10 mg) of active peptide/protein complex. ([Peptide Shop][2])

⚠️ These are **manufacturer recommendations**, not validated clinical doses. No **minimum effective dose**, **therapeutic index**, or formal **safe range** have been established in controlled human studies.

---

## ⚠️ Safety Profile & Side Effects

There are **no authoritative clinical safety studies** on Vasalamin.

Vendor materials often state “no side effects or accumulation,” but this is *unverified marketing language*. ([RUPharma][1])

Without regulatory or clinical data, you **cannot assume safety** — especially in people with:

* cardiovascular disease
* pregnancy
* chronic illness
* concurrent medications

Always consult a healthcare provider before use.

---

## 🧠 Current Scientific Evidence Status

✔ There are **no peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetic studies** on Vasalamin.
✔ There are **no controlled clinical trials** supporting its efficacy.
✔ There is **no standardized pharmacodynamic characterization** in pharmacology references.

The existing product claims **come from supplement vendors** and are *marketing statements*, not evidence-based pharmacology.

## 📌 Summary Table (what exists vs what does *not*)

| Category            | Known (Evidence)                     | Not Proven/Unknown                |

| Pharmacokinetics    | None published                       | Half-life, Tmax, AUC              |
| Bioavailability     | Oral formulation exists              | Actual systemic bioavailability   |
| Dosing              | Manufacturer suggestions             | Clinical dose-response curve      |
| Safety              | No formal data                       | Adverse effects, toxicity profile |
| Regulatory approval | None                                 | EMA/FDA/MHRA approval             |

## 🧠 General Note on Peptide/Protein Drugs

Most peptide-based drugs have:

* **poor oral absorption** and low bioavailability unless specially formulated. ([PMC][5])
* **rapid degradation** by gastrointestinal and systemic proteases. ([PMC][5])
* Without modification (e.g., PEGylation, carriers), peptides typically have **very short half-lives**. ([PMC][5])

This general science explains *why* precise PK data for Vasalamin is likely absent — most peptide complexes are **not orally bioavailable without specialized formulation**.

---

## 🧠 Bottom Line

**No reliable pharmacological measurements exist for Vasalamin**. All claims about actions, half-life, bioavailability, dose ranges, and safety are **marketing material**, not validated pharmacology.

---

If you want, I can help you find **any published clinical studies (if they exist)** or explain why peptides generally have low oral bioavailability and short half-lives.
