### Pharmacological Actions of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)

PQQ is a redox-active compound that functions as an enzymatic cofactor, antioxidant, and modulator of cellular signaling pathways. It influences various biological processes, primarily through its ability to scavenge free radicals, promote mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhance NAD+-dependent pathways. Below, I outline the key pharmacological actions based on available data from animal, cell culture, and human studies. For each action, I've included details on mechanisms (how it influences physiological processes), as this appears to align with your request for "values for each of time to know how each pharmacological actions influence" (interpreted as mechanistic details or explanatory values). Where quantifiable data exists (e.g., from studies on enzyme modulation, gene expression, or physiological outcomes), I've provided it. Note that PQQ is not a pharmaceutical drug but a nutrient-like compound, so effects are often dose-dependent and studied in the context of supplementation (typically 10-60 mg/day in humans).

1. **Antioxidant Activity**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ acts as a potent scavenger of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, reducing oxidative stress by cycling between oxidized (PQQ) and reduced (PQQH2) forms. It attenuates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, protects cellular components from damage, and enhances overall redox balance. In studies, PQQ reduces lipid peroxidation (e.g., measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) by 20-50% in models of oxidative injury. It also modulates lactate dehydrogenase and other enzymes to increase NAD+ levels, indirectly boosting sirtuin activity (e.g., SIRT1 upregulation by 1.5-2-fold). This leads to improved cellular resilience against ischemia, inflammation, and aging-related oxidative damage.  
   - **Key Values**: Antioxidant capacity is 7.4 times that of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in radical scavenging assays; effective at nanomolar concentrations (0.1-1 nM) in cell cultures for ROS reduction.

2. **Promotion of Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Function**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) by 1.5-3-fold, along with nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1, NRF-2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). This enhances mitochondrial density (up to 20-30% increase in neonatal models) and bioenergetics, improving ATP production and respiratory chain efficiency. It preserves mitochondrial complexes and reduces insulin resistance in hypoxic conditions. In obesity models, it mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to better energy metabolism and reduced fat accumulation.  
   - **Key Values**: Increases mitochondrial content by 20-50% in rodent livers; modulates NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases, elevating NAD+ levels by 10-20% to enhance sirtuin targets.

3. **Neuroprotective Effects**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ crosses the blood-brain barrier and protects neurons from glutamate, 6-hydroxydopamine, and amyloid-beta toxicity by reducing ROS and modulating SIRT1/CREB pathways (up to 2-fold activation). It promotes nerve growth factor production (1.5-2 times baseline) and inhibits neuronal apoptosis. In models of stroke or cognitive deficits, it improves synapse-related gene expression and cognitive function, while attenuating inflammation via reduced NF-κB activation.  
   - **Key Values**: Reduces neuronal death by 30-50% in in vitro injury models; enhances cognitive scores by 10-20% in aging rodent studies.

4. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ lowers inflammation markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by scavenging ROS and modulating signaling pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K/Akt). In human studies, it decreases CRP by 10-45% and IL-6 by 20-30%. It ameliorates obesity-related inflammation, reducing visceral fat and hepatic lipid accumulation via PGC-1α-mediated metabolic shifts.  
   - **Key Values**: Reduces IL-6 levels by 20-45% in supplemented humans (0.3 mg/kg/day); inhibits NF-κB by 25-40% in cell cultures.

5. **Cardioprotective and Anti-Ischemic Effects**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ protects cardiac myocytes from oxidative injury by enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing reoxygenation damage. It improves bioenergetics in hypoxic cells, preserving respiratory complexes and lowering insulin resistance. In pulmonary hypertension models, it regulates mitochondrial metabolism to improve vascular function.  
   - **Key Values**: Reduces infarct size by 20-40% in rodent ischemia models; increases mitochondrial potential by 15-30% in stressed cells.

6. **Anti-Diabetic and Metabolic Improvement**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ enhances glucose dehydrogenase activity for better glucose sensing and reduces insulin resistance via mitochondrial enhancement and SIRT1 activation. It improves metabolic flexibility, promoting fat oxidation and reducing lipotoxicity. In diabetic models, it lowers blood glucose by modulating AMPK pathways.  
   - **Key Values**: Decreases insulin resistance indices by 15-25% in cell studies; improves glucose tolerance in rodents at 2-5 mg/kg doses.

7. **Anti-Obesity Effects**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ reduces visceral and hepatic fat accumulation by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation. It ameliorates obesity comorbidities like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic kidney disease via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.  
   - **Key Values**: Reduces fat mass by 10-20% in high-fat diet rodent models; lowers triglyceride levels by 15-30%.

8. **Immunomodulatory and Growth-Promoting Effects**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ increases CD4+ T-cell counts and IL-2 production for immune enhancement. It supports growth and reproduction by improving mitochondrial function in neonates, leading to better fertility and development. In deficiency models, repletion restores growth rates.  
   - **Key Values**: Enhances neonatal growth by 10-20% in PQQ-deficient diets; boosts IL-2 by 15-25% in immune assays.

9. **Anti-Cancer and Anti-Degenerative Potential**  
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: As an antioxidant, PQQ scavenges radicals to prevent DNA damage and modulates pathways like mTOR and EGFR for cell proliferation/apoptosis balance. It shows promise in reducing melanoma and neurodegeneration via reduced oxidative stress.  
   - **Key Values**: Inhibits cancer cell growth by 20-40% in vitro; extends lifespan markers in models by 10-15%.

10. **Sleep and Cognitive Enhancement**  
    - **Mechanism/Influence**: PQQ modulates PGC-1α for better sleep maintenance and reduces encephalitis via neuroprotection. It improves memory and attention in aging models.  
    - **Key Values**: Enhances sleep quality scores by 10-20% in studies; boosts nerve growth factor by 1.5-fold.

11. **Other Actions (e.g., Anti-Melanogenic, Radioprotective)**  
    - **Mechanism/Influence**: Inhibits melanin production via tyrosinase modulation; protects against radiation via ROS scavenging.  
    - **Key Values**: Reduces melanin by 20-30% in skin models; radioprotection at 3 mg/kg in animals.

### Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life and Bioavailabilities

- **Half-Life**: Plasma half-life is approximately 2-3 hours in humans and animals after oral administration. Despite the short half-life, effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression can persist for days due to downstream signaling (e.g., PGC-1α activation lasts 24-48 hours post-dose).

- **Bioavailabilities**: 
  - Oral route: High bioavailability, with 60-62% absorption in the lower intestine (from rodent studies; similar in humans). Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) reaches ~9-14 nM within 1-3 hours after a 0.2-0.3 mg/kg dose. About 80-95% of absorbed PQQ binds to blood cells, with primary excretion via urine (81% of dose within 24 hours, 10-15% unchanged). No significant accumulation occurs with repeated dosing. Derivatives (e.g., IPQ from amino acid reactions) may form, but free PQQ is detectable in tissues like kidney and skin up to 24 hours. In humans, fasting levels rise linearly with dose (2-14 nM at 0.075-0.3 mg/kg). Compared to other routes, oral is the most studied and efficient for supplementation; intravenous data (limited) shows faster clearance but similar distribution.

### Dosages and Safety

PQQ is generally safe as a supplement, with no reported toxicity in humans at studied doses. It's considered a novel food/nutraceutical, not a vitamin, but with vitamin-like effects. Dosages are based on human trials (up to 60 mg/day) and animal toxicology.

- **Minimum Effective Dose**: 0.075-0.2 mg/kg/day (about 5-20 mg/day for a 70 kg adult) for antioxidant and inflammatory benefits (e.g., reduces CRP/IL-6). In studies, 0.1-1 nM in cells shows mitochondrial effects.

- **Safe Range**: 10-60 mg/day in adults (0.1-0.3 mg/kg), as per human trials with no adverse effects. For general use, 20 mg/day is common and approved in supplements (e.g., by FDA as GRAS up to 20 mg/serving). Avoid in pregnancy/lactation due to lack of data.

- **Maximum Without High Risks**: Up to 60 mg/day in short-term human studies; animal NOAEL is 400 mg/kg/day (equivalent to ~4-5 g/day in humans, adjusted for body surface area). Beyond this, reversible kidney changes may occur in sensitive models.

- **LD50**: Oral LD50 in rats is 1000-2000 mg/kg (females lower at 500-1000 mg/kg); other estimates 3690-5010 mg/kg. In humans, extrapolates to >35-50 g/day (over 1000x typical dose), indicating very low acute toxicity.

- **When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous**: Toxicity is rare; at >400 mg/kg/day in rats (subchronic), reversible increases in kidney weight, urine protein, and crystals occur (NOAEL 100-400 mg/kg/day). In humans, no issues up to 60 mg/day, but >100-200 mg/kg (7-14 g for 70 kg) may risk renal strain based on animal data. No genotoxicity or teratogenicity observed. Monitor kidney function at high doses; start low to assess tolerance.
