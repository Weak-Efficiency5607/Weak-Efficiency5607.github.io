**PRL-8-147** is a hypothetical or unreleased nootropic compound developed by Dr. Nikolaus Hansl at Creighton University in the 1970s, as a follow-up to the better-known **PRL-8-53**. Unlike PRL-8-53, whose chemical structure is publicly documented (IUPAC name: methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride; molecular formula: C₁₈H₂₁NO₂ for the free base, often as the HCl salt), the structure of PRL-8-147 remains unknown and has never been published or patented individually.

Multiple sources across scientific discussions, nootropics forums (e.g., Reddit's r/Nootropics, LongeCity), and chemical databases consistently describe PRL-8-147 as a "lost" or "unreleased" compound. Reports indicate that its formula existed only in Dr. Hansl's private notes, and efforts to retrieve it (including contacts with his family) were unsuccessful. Rumors suggest it was a more potent derivative intended to outperform PRL-8-53 in memory enhancement, with some animal toxicology data referenced in obscure abstracts (e.g., a 1977 Nebraska Academy of Sciences proceeding titled "Pharmacological and toxicological characteristics of PRL-8-147"), but no structural details are provided anywhere.

Hansl's known patents cover related aminoethyl benzoic acid derivatives (e.g., esters and amides like m-[2-(benzylamino)ethyl]benzoic acid variants), and PRL-8-53 fits within that series as a meta-substituted methyl ester with an N-methyl-N-benzyl amine. PRL-8-147 might have been a minor modification (e.g., different ester/amide group, substituent position, or amine variation), but this is pure speculation—there is no evidence to support any specific deduction.

In summary, the complete structure of PRL-8-147 is not known publicly, and no reliable deduction is possible based on available information. It remains a "lost treasure" in nootropics lore, with no CAS number, IUPAC name, or synthesis route documented. If new details ever surface (e.g., from archived papers), that could change, but as of now, it cannot be determined.
