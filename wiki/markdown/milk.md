Milk provides key nutrients like calcium, vitamin D (especially when fortified), protein, phosphorus, and magnesium that support bone formation and maintenance. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that dairy supplementation, including milk, can increase bone mineral density (BMD) in various populations, such as children, adolescents, and postmenopausal women. For instance, in healthy postmenopausal women, dairy products have been linked to a 0.7–1.8% increase in BMD over two years, depending on the measurement site. In children aged 3–18, dairy intake has been associated with gains in whole-body BMD by about 1.8% and reductions in bone turnover markers, potentially aiding peak bone mass development. Longitudinal studies also indicate that lifelong milk consumption, particularly in midlife, correlates with higher BMD in old age.

On the fracture prevention side, some evidence suggests benefits from moderate intake. A meta-analysis found that consuming 200–250 ml of milk daily may reduce fracture risk by 5% or more in adult Caucasian women. Another analysis showed that dairy intake at levels up to 250 grams per day was linked to a lower risk of osteoporosis. Fermented dairy products like yogurt and cheese appear particularly protective, with cohort studies associating them with a 10–15% lower fracture risk compared to non-fermented milk. High-calcium milk has also shown promise in improving BMD and regulating gut flora in postmenopausal women, potentially reducing osteoporosis progression.

However, the evidence isn't uniformly positive, and some studies highlight potential drawbacks or limitations. High milk intake (three or more glasses per day) has been associated in observational research with increased fracture risk—up to 2–9% higher per glass in women—and even higher mortality rates. A large Swedish cohort study, for example, found that women drinking three or more glasses daily nearly doubled their mortality risk compared to those drinking less than one, alongside elevated fracture rates, possibly due to compounds like D-galactose promoting inflammation. Other research, including a 12-year Harvard study of over 78,000 women, found no protective effect of milk against fractures. Critics argue that while milk boosts BMD short-term, it may not translate to long-term fracture prevention, especially without factors like exercise or adequate vitamin D. In populations with low dairy consumption, like in Japan or India, hip fracture rates remain low, suggesting milk isn't essential.

Additionally, not all dairy is equal—plain or fortified milk shows benefits in some trials, but cottage cheese or high-fat options may have neutral or adverse effects on bone health. For lactose-intolerant individuals, fermented options or non-dairy calcium sources (e.g., leafy greens, tofu, fortified plant milks) can provide similar benefits without drawbacks. Overall, meta-analyses of umbrella reviews indicate dairy consumption is generally linked to better bone health outcomes, but associations with fracture risk are weaker in prospective cohorts than in case-control studies.

In summary, milk is neither unequivocally good nor bad for bones—it offers clear nutritional benefits for BMD when consumed moderately (1–2 glasses daily) as part of a balanced diet, but excessive intake may pose risks, and it's not the only path to strong bones. Exercise, overall nutrient intake, and individual factors like age and genetics play larger roles. If you're concerned about bone health, consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
