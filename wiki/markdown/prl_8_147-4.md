The two compounds—methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride (also known as PRL-8-53) and its ethyl ester analog—are structurally very similar, differing only in the ester alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl). This minor change can lead to subtle pharmacological differences, primarily driven by variations in physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and membrane permeability. Both are likely to exhibit nootropic effects similar to PRL-8-53, including memory enhancement, potential cholinergic activity, dopamine potentiation, and partial serotonin inhibition, based on the known pharmacology of the series. However, specific predictions focus on bioavailability and CNS penetration as requested, with other potential differences noted.

### Bioavailability
- **Predicted Differences**: The ethyl ester is expected to have slightly higher oral bioavailability compared to the methyl ester. This is due to its higher calculated logP (3.54 vs. 3.15), which enhances passive diffusion across the gastrointestinal epithelium, potentially improving absorption. Both compounds have favorable properties for oral absorption (e.g., molecular weight <300 Da, low topological polar surface area of ~29.5 Å², no hydrogen bond donors, and rotatable bonds <10), but the added methylene group in the ethyl ester increases hydrophobicity, which could reduce first-pass metabolism or improve partitioning into systemic circulation.
- **Rationale**: In similar ester-based drugs (e.g., omega-3 fatty acid esters or amino acid esters), longer alkyl chains like ethyl often show improved pharmacokinetic profiles, including higher plasma concentrations, compared to methyl counterparts. If ester hydrolysis occurs (e.g., via carboxylesterases in the liver or plasma), the methyl ester may be metabolized more rapidly to the corresponding benzoic acid, potentially lowering its bioavailability if the acid is less active or more rapidly cleared. No direct clinical data exists for the ethyl analog, but structural analogies suggest minimal impact from solubility (both hydrochlorides are water-soluble).

### CNS Penetration
- **Predicted Differences**: The ethyl ester is likely to exhibit modestly better CNS penetration than the methyl ester, leading to potentially stronger or more sustained central effects (e.g., enhanced memory retention or dopaminergic modulation). Its higher logP favors better crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where lipophilicity is a key factor for passive diffusion.
- **Rationale**: Both compounds have properties conducive to BBB permeability (low TPSA, no HBD, logP in the 3–4 range optimal for CNS drugs), but the ethyl ester's increased hydrophobicity could improve partitioning into lipid-rich brain tissue. In contrast, the methyl ester (PRL-8-53) is known to be CNS-active at low oral doses (e.g., improving learning and retention in human studies), but the ethyl variant's extra rotatable bond and slight molecular weight increase (297 vs. 283 Da) are unlikely to hinder this—lipophilicity gains should dominate. Examples from related ester series (e.g., beta-carboline carboxylates) show that methyl and ethyl esters can differ in CNS-mediated effects like convulsions or jerks, possibly due to varying penetration or hydrolysis rates.

### Other Potential Pharmacological Differences
- **Metabolic Stability and Duration**: Methyl esters are generally more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than ethyl esters, which could result in faster clearance for the methyl compound and a shorter duration of action. If the parent esters are the active moieties (as implied in patent data for this series), the ethyl ester might provide longer-lasting effects.
- **Overall Activity Profile**: Both should share spasmolytic, psychotherapeutic, and learning-facilitating properties, with low toxicity (e.g., LD50 >500 mg/kg in rodents). However, the ethyl ester's enhanced lipophilicity might amplify CNS-related side effects (e.g., mild hypotension or motor depression at high doses) or improve efficacy in memory tasks, though this is speculative without direct testing.
- **Limitations**: These predictions are based on computational descriptors (e.g., from RDKit) and analogies from similar ester drugs; actual differences would require in vivo studies. The ethyl ester appears in patent literature (US3870715) as part of the same series but has not been clinically developed, unlike PRL-8-53.
