### Possible Structures for PRL-8-147

PRL-8-147 is an unreleased, more potent analog of PRL-8-53 (methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride) developed by Nikolaus Hansl. Its exact structure remains unknown, as it was never patented or published in detail, and appears only in limited references like animal studies and personal notes. Based on Hansl's patent (US3870715) for similar substituted amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters, PRL-8-147 is likely a variation in this family, possibly with modifications to enhance CNS penetration, potency, or acetylcholine response. These could include changes to the ester group (for better bioavailability), amine substituents (for altered receptor affinity), or alkyl chain (for structural tweaks).

Here is a list of deduced possibilities, ranked by likelihood based on common analog patterns in the patent and nootropic design principles (e.g., increasing lipophilicity or adding functional groups for better memory enhancement). I've included chemical names, SMILES notations (for visualization), and rationale for each:

1. **Ethyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OCC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Simple ester upgrade from methyl (in PRL-8-53) to ethyl, common for improved absorption and potency in analogs; listed as an example in the patent.

2. **n-Propyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OCCC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Longer alkyl chain on the ester (propyl instead of methyl) for enhanced lipophilicity and brain penetration; patent explicitly includes n-propyl esters as variations.

3. **t-Butyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Branched ester like t-butyl for steric protection and potentially higher potency; patent mentions t-butyl esters, which could make it "more powerful" by altering pharmacokinetics.

4. **Methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(ethyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CCN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Amine modification from methyl to ethyl on the benzylamino group; patent includes benzylethylamino analogs, which might boost cholinergic effects for better memory enhancement.

5. **Methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(2-methoxyethyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: COCCN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Adds a methoxyethyl to the amine for possible hydrogen bonding or solubility improvements; patent has N-benzyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)amino examples, aligning with potency upgrades.

6. **Methyl 3-[1-methyl-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CC(C)c1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Alpha-methyl substitution on the ethyl chain for chiral or steric effects; patent describes alpha-methyl variants, which could enhance selectivity or duration.

7. **Methyl 3-[2-(morpholino)ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: C1COCCN1CCc2cccc(c2)C(=O)OC  
   Rationale: Replaces benzylmethylamino with morpholino (heterocyclic); patent lists morpholino analogs, potentially more potent if aiming for different receptor interactions.

8. **Benzyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OCc2ccccc2)Cc3ccccc3  
   Rationale: Esterified with benzyl alcohol for aromatic enhancement; patent includes benzyl esters, which might improve blood-brain barrier crossing.

9. **Methyl 3-[1-methoxy-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate**  
   SMILES: CN(CC(OC)c1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC)Cc2ccccc2  
   Rationale: Beta-methoxy on the chain for added functionality; patent has methoxy-substituted examples, possibly increasing metabolic stability or efficacy.

10. **Methyl 3-[2-(piperidino)ethyl]benzoate**  
    SMILES: C1CCCN(C1)CCc2cccc(c2)C(=O)OC  
    Rationale: Piperidino heterocyclic amine instead of benzylmethyl; common in patent for ring-based variations, could be a "potent successor" if heterocyclic forms show better nootropic profiles in unpublished tests.

These are educated speculations—without Hansl's private notes or lost research, confirmation is impossible. If PRL-8-147 follows the pattern, it's likely one of the ester or amine tweaks for optimization. For synthesis or testing, custom labs could produce these, but safety is unverified beyond PRL-8-53's data.
