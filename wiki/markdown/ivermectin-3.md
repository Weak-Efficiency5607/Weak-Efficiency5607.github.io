### Key Points
- Research suggests the highest safe daily dose of Ivermectin for three weeks is around 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, based on short-term studies, but long-term daily use lacks extensive research.
- It seems likely that higher doses, up to 600 micrograms per kilogram daily, are safe for short periods (up to three days), but safety for extended daily use is uncertain.
- The evidence leans toward consulting a healthcare professional, as daily dosing for three weeks is not standard and may carry risks not yet fully studied.

### Dosage Recommendation
Based on available studies, a daily dose of approximately 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight appears to be a reasonable upper limit for safety over three weeks, given its use in shorter durations without significant adverse effects. However, this is an extrapolation, and safety for such prolonged daily use has not been extensively established.

### Safety Considerations
Ivermectin is generally well-tolerated at standard doses, but daily use for three weeks is not a typical regimen for approved conditions like strongyloidiasis or onchocerciasis, which usually involve single or spaced doses. Potential risks, especially at higher doses, include neurological effects, though rare in humans due to the blood-brain barrier. Always discuss with a doctor, especially for off-label use.

### Medical Advice
Given the lack of direct evidence for three weeks of daily dosing, it’s crucial to seek medical advice before starting such a regimen. A healthcare provider can assess individual health conditions and potential interactions, ensuring safety and efficacy.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Ivermectin Daily Dosing for Three Weeks

This note provides a comprehensive review of the available literature and data on the highest safe daily dose of Ivermectin for a three-week period, based on current medical research and guidelines as of August 1, 2025. Ivermectin, an antiparasitic medication, is primarily approved for conditions such as strongyloidiasis, onchocerciasis, and scabies, with typical dosing regimens involving single or spaced doses rather than daily administration over extended periods. The focus here is to synthesize evidence from clinical studies, pharmacokinetic data, and safety profiles to address the query, acknowledging the complexity and lack of direct evidence for the specific regimen requested.

#### Background and Approved Uses
Ivermectin, available in oral tablet form (e.g., Stromectol) with strengths of 3 mg, 6 mg, and 12 mg, is FDA-approved for treating intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis in humans, typically at a dose of 150–200 micrograms per kilogram (mcg/kg) as a single dose, with retreatment possibly needed every 3–12 months for onchocerciasis. For scabies, off-label use includes two doses of 200 mcg/kg 7–14 days apart, and for crusted scabies, multiple doses (up to seven) may be given over a month, spaced at intervals (e.g., days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 22, 29). These regimens do not involve daily dosing for three weeks, highlighting a gap in standard practice for the queried duration.

#### Pharmacokinetic Insights
Ivermectin’s pharmacokinetics are critical for understanding safety in repeated dosing. Studies indicate an elimination half-life ranging from 12 to 54.5 hours, with a typical value around 18–36 hours, suggesting moderate accumulation with daily dosing. For a drug with a half-life of approximately 24 hours, daily dosing leads to an accumulation ratio of about 2, meaning steady-state concentrations are roughly twice those after a single dose, reached after about 5 days (5 half-lives). This implies that prolonged daily dosing could result in sustained exposure, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects if doses are too high.

- **Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameters from Studies**
  | Reference | Dose | Population | Elimination Half-Life (hours) |
  |-----------|------|------------|------------------------------|
  | [8 a]     | 6 mg | Healthy    | 12.6                        |
  | [8 a]     | 12 mg| Healthy    | 13.4                        |
  | [12]      | 150 µg/kg | Healthy    | 36.6                        |
  | [16]      | 6 mg | Onchocerciasis | 54.5                   |

This table, derived from a review of pharmacokinetic studies, shows variability in half-life, influencing accumulation with repeated dosing.

#### Clinical Studies on Repeated and Daily Dosing
Several studies provide insights into repeated or daily dosing, though not specifically for three weeks. For instance:
- A study on COVID-19 treatment used 12 mg (approximately 200 mcg/kg for a 60 kg person) daily for 5 days, finding it safe with no significant adverse effects, and effective in reducing viral clearance time (PMC, published 2020-12-02, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7709596/).
- In dengue fever, a phase III study demonstrated safety for daily doses of 200–400 µg/kg over three days (European Journal of Medical Research, 2022-02-05, https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-022-00645-8).
- For malaria transmission reduction, doses of 300 and 600 mcg/kg/day for three days were safe, with Cmax similar to single doses of 800 mcg/kg, which is well-tolerated (PMC, 2016-11-17, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133431/).
- A study by Guzzo et al. (2002, PubMed ID: 12362927) showed safety for single doses up to 120 mg (2000 mcg/kg for a 60 kg person) and 60 mg three times weekly, with no significant CNS toxicity, suggesting tolerance for higher repeated doses at intervals.

These studies indicate that short-term daily dosing (up to 5 days) at 200–600 mcg/kg/day is generally safe, but none extend to three weeks, creating uncertainty for prolonged use.

#### High-Dose and Long-Term Safety Data
High-dose studies provide additional context:
- Single doses up to 2000 mcg/kg were well-tolerated, with no increased adverse events (Guzzo et al., 2002, PubMed ID: 12362927).
- In Rhesus monkeys, daily doses of 1.2 mg/kg (1200 µg/kg) for 16 days showed no undesirable effects (PMC, 2018-02-01, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5835698/).
- For crusted scabies, regimens involve up to seven doses of 200 mcg/kg over a month, totaling 1400 mcg/kg, with no significant safety issues reported (CDC, 2023-12-18, https://www.cdc.gov/scabies/hcp/clinical-care/index.html).

These data suggest a wide safety margin, but daily dosing for three weeks (21 days) exceeds the duration of most studies, and accumulation could potentially increase risk, particularly at higher doses.

#### Estimating the Highest Safe Daily Dose for Three Weeks
Given the lack of direct evidence, estimation relies on extrapolation:
- At 200 mcg/kg daily, used safely for 5 days in COVID-19 studies, steady-state concentrations (approximately twice single-dose levels) remain within the safety margin of single doses up to 2000 mcg/kg, suggesting safety for three weeks.
- Higher doses, like 600 mcg/kg/day for three days in malaria studies, were safe, but for 21 days, accumulation might exceed safe thresholds, given the half-life and potential for CNS effects at very high exposures, though rare in humans.
- Comparative analysis with spaced dosing (e.g., 60 mg three times weekly, about 857 mcg/kg per dose for a 70 kg person, safe over two weeks) suggests daily doses around 300–400 mcg/kg might be tolerable, but without long-term data, 200 mcg/kg is a conservative estimate.

#### Potential Risks and Considerations
Ivermectin’s safety profile is excellent at standard doses, with side effects like dizziness, nausea, and rash reported in less than 4% of patients (Next Steps in Dermatology, 2025-03-04, https://nextstepsinderm.com/derm-topics/oral-ivermectin-therapeutic-cheat-sheet/). However, higher doses or prolonged use could increase risks, including:
- Neurological effects (e.g., confusion, tremor) at very high doses, though mitigated by the blood-brain barrier.
- Liver function concerns, as Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and prolonged exposure might affect hepatic function, especially in elderly patients with pre-existing conditions.
- Reports of toxic effects from misuse (e.g., veterinary formulations, high doses for COVID-19) highlight the importance of medical supervision (NEJM, 2021-10-20, https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907).

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
Based on current evidence, the highest safe daily dose of Ivermectin for three weeks is likely around 200 mcg/kg per day, extrapolated from short-term studies showing safety at this level for up to five days, with pharmacokinetic modeling suggesting manageable accumulation. However, this is not a standard regimen, and safety for such prolonged daily use is not well-established. Consultation with a healthcare provider is essential, especially considering individual health factors, potential interactions, and the lack of FDA approval for daily long-term use. This recommendation aligns with the need for cautious, evidence-based use, acknowledging the gaps in long-term data.
