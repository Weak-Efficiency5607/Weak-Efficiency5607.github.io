Fabomotizole (also known as afobazole; CAS 173352-21-5, noting the user's provided CAS 173352-21-1 appears to be a minor typo) is a selective anxiolytic drug primarily used in Russia for treating anxiety disorders and adjustment disorders. It is not a benzodiazepine and lacks sedative, hypnotic, or muscle relaxant effects at therapeutic doses. Below, I outline its pharmacological actions based on available data, including any quantitative measures (e.g., binding affinities like Ki values, where known) that indicate potency or influence. These values help illustrate the drug's relative strength in interacting with targets—lower Ki values generally mean higher affinity and potentially stronger influence at that site. I've provided as many values as possible from reliable sources, noting that the mechanism is not fully elucidated and some actions are proposed based on preclinical studies.

### Pharmacological Actions and Associated Values
Fabomotizole's effects stem from interactions with multiple targets, leading to anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and neuroprotective outcomes without CNS depression. Key actions include:

- **Sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) agonism/chaperone activity**: Acts as a ligand at sigma-1 receptors, enhancing cellular stress responses, modulating calcium signaling, and providing neuroprotection against ischemia, acidosis, and stress. This is considered a primary mechanism for anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects.
  - Ki = 5.9 µM (moderate affinity; higher doses needed for significant effect).
  - IC50 = 6.4–13.7 µM (in mouse brain homogenates, varying by strain; indicates inhibition of ligand binding).
  - Influence: Prevents stress-induced reductions in GABA_A receptor benzodiazepine site binding; reduces neuronal calcium overload in ischemia models at 0.3–3 mg/kg (animal doses). Anxiolytic effects in elevated plus maze tests (e.g., increased open-arm time) at 2.5–5 mg/kg in mice are blocked by sigma-1 antagonists like BD-1047 or NE-100.

- **Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) reversible inhibition**: Inhibits MAO-A, potentially increasing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels, contributing to mood stabilization and anxiolytic effects.
  - Ki = 3.6 µM (moderate affinity).
  - Influence: Reversible, unlike irreversible MAOIs; may enhance serotoninergic tone without strong antidepressant effects. Involved in anti-stress responses but less potent than dedicated MAOIs.

- **Melatonin receptor type 3 (MT3; also NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 or NQO2) antagonism**: Antagonizes MT3 receptors, which may modulate oxidative stress and neuroprotection.
  - Ki = 0.97 µM (high affinity; stronger interaction compared to other targets).
  - Influence: Contributes to neuroprotective effects; metabolite M-11 (main active metabolite) retains this activity, potentially prolonging some effects.

- **Melatonin receptor type 1 (MT1) agonism**: Agonism at MT1 receptors, possibly influencing sleep-wake cycles and neuroprotection, though affinity is low.
  - Ki = 160 µM (low affinity; minimal influence at therapeutic doses; some sources report 16 µM, but 160 µM is more consistent across data).
  - Influence: Suggested role in anxiolytic effects, but weak; may promote nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release.

- **GABAergic modulation (indirect)**: Proposed promotion of GABA_A receptor function via sigma-1 interactions, without direct binding to benzodiazepine sites.
  - No direct Ki/IC50 available (not a direct ligand).
  - Influence: Enhances GABA signaling under stress; prevents ischemia-induced calcium overload in neurons at 10–100 µM in vitro.

- **NGF and BDNF release promotion**: Stimulates release of neurotrophic factors, supporting neuronal survival and plasticity.
  - No specific quantitative values (preclinical observations).
  - Influence: Neuroprotective in stroke models; reduces neuronal death in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) at 0.3–3 mg/kg.

- **Serotonin receptor involvement (unspecified)**: Potential indirect effects on serotonin systems, possibly via MAO-A inhibition.
  - No specific Ki/IC50.
  - Influence: May contribute to anxiolytic mood effects; not well-quantified.

- **Other neuroprotective actions**: Antimutagenic and antiteratogenic in mice; reduces hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin models.
  - Effective at 10 mg/kg (animal dose) for reducing malondialdehyde accumulation.
  - Influence: Broad anti-stress effects; restores dopamine in Parkinson's models (e.g., 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum) at deferred doses.

These actions collectively produce anxiolytic effects (e.g., reducing anxiety in generalized anxiety disorder) and neuroprotection (e.g., in ischemia or stress models) without sedation. Potency is generally moderate (micromolar Ki values), requiring multi-target engagement for full effects. Clinical efficacy is seen at 30 mg/day, non-inferior to diazepam (30 mg/day) in trials but with better safety.

### Half-Life
- Elimination half-life: 0.82 ± 0.54 hours (short, necessitating multiple daily doses to maintain levels; no accumulation with repeated dosing).

### Bioavailabilities
- Oral bioavailability: 43.64% (moderate, with pronounced first-pass hepatic metabolism reducing systemic exposure).
- No data on other routes (e.g., IV, IM) in standard use; the drug is primarily oral. Preclinical studies may use IP or IV, but human bioavailability for non-oral routes is not established. Extensive hepatic metabolism (via CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) yields inactive metabolites, with renal excretion (~70% as metabolites).

### Dosages
Fabomotizole is typically administered orally in tablets. Doses are based on clinical trials and Russian guidelines (not FDA-evaluated).

- **Minimum effective dose**: 10 mg/day (divided; e.g., 5–10 mg 1–2 times daily), sufficient for mild anxiety in some patients.
- **Standard/therapeutic range (safe range)**: 10–30 mg/day, divided into 2–3 doses (e.g., 10 mg three times daily). Used for 2–4 weeks, extendable to 12 weeks under supervision.
- **Maximum dose without high risks**: Up to 60 mg/day (divided; e.g., 20 mg three times daily) in severe cases, per some clinical practices, with monitoring. Exceeding this increases side effect risk without proportional benefit.
- **LD50 (lethal dose 50%)**: Not publicly available for humans (rare overdose reports; low toxicity profile). In animal studies (mice/rats), LD50 >1,000 mg/kg (oral/IP), indicating very low acute toxicity. No fatal human overdoses reported; drug has a wide therapeutic index.
- **When it starts to become too dangerous (estimation)**: Doses >60–100 mg/day may increase risks of mild-to-moderate side effects (e.g., nausea, headache, dizziness). Overdose symptoms (rare, even at high doses) include drowsiness, GI upset, or allergic reactions; severe toxicity unlikely without co-ingestants. At >200–500 mg (estimation based on animal scaling), potential for pronounced CNS effects or organ strain, but no data on lethal thresholds in humans. Seek medical help for any suspected overdose; supportive care is sufficient due to short half-life.

Side effects are mild/rare (e.g., nausea, headache, dizziness, allergic rash; <5% incidence) and resolve quickly. No withdrawal, dependence, or abuse potential. Well-tolerated in trials vs. diazepam.

For closed-ended math (e.g., half-life calculations), no specific equations are needed here, but half-life (t1/2 = 0.82 h) means plasma levels halve every ~0.82 hours: after 1 dose, ~50% remains at 0.82 h; ~25% at 1.64 h. Steady-state with TID dosing maintains therapeutic levels.
