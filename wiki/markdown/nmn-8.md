Here’s what the **scientific evidence says** about whether NMN supplementation causes *lasting downregulation* of endogenous NAD⁺ synthesis or related pathways after stopping — based on the **best available research and mechanistic studies** (not Reddit anecdotes). ([PMC][1])

---

## 📌 **1. Evidence on Enzyme Levels & Feedback Regulation**

### ✅ **No Clear Evidence of Permanent Downregulation**

* Research shows NMN reliably increases NAD⁺ levels during supplementation, but **there’s no confirmed mechanism showing that NMN permanently downregulates NAMPT or other NAD⁺ synthesis enzymes after stopping**. ([PMC][1])
* A human clinical trial found NAD⁺ levels increased during NMN supplementation and then **returned toward baseline after supplementation ended**, suggesting temporary effects rather than long-term suppression of endogenous pathways. ([PMC][2])
* Reviews on NMN/NR metabolism state that **there is limited data on the long-term effects on enzyme expressions**, and that pathways adjust dynamically with NAD⁺ levels. ([PMC][3])

### ⚠️ **Transient Regulation is Biologically Plausible**

* Metabolic systems like the NAD⁺ salvage pathway are **regulated by feedback** — high NAD⁺ levels can transiently influence expression or activity of enzymes (e.g., NRK, NMNAT) depending on tissue type and metabolic context. ([PMC][1])
* This kind of regulation would be *adaptive* (temporary shift) rather than a permanent shut-off of endogenous NAD⁺ production.

**Bottom line:** Available evidence **does not demonstrate lasting downregulation** of NAD⁺ synthesis enzymes or pathways after NMN is discontinued.

## 📌 **2. Mechanistic Pathways & Potential Regulatory Checks**

Below are the main ways NMN could theoretically influence regulation, along with what the research says about permanence:

### 🧠 **A. NAMPT Expression**

* NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme for the NAD⁺ salvage pathway.
* Aging and metabolic stress can downregulate NAMPT, while exercise upregulates it. ([Wikipédia][4])
* There is *no solid evidence* that NMN itself causes sustained suppression of NAMPT after stopping supplementation.

**CONCLUSION:** No demonstrated lasting downregulation.

---

### 🧬 **B. NAD⁺ Salvage Pathway Enzymes (NRK, NMNAT)**

* Some research shows levels of uptake and utilization enzymes may vary across tissues and conditions, but this reflects metabolic flexibility rather than permanent suppression. ([PMC][1])
* For instance, NMN can be effectively utilized even when certain enzyme activities are lower, suggesting alternative uptake pathways help maintain NAD⁺ production. ([PMC][1])

**CONCLUSION:** Regulatory shifts are flexible, not permanently downregulated.

---

### 🧩 **C. SARM1/NMN Ratio and Signalling**

* In neuronal models, elevated NMN relative to NAD⁺ can activate SARM1, a pro-degenerative enzyme. This is a *specific cellular context* and not evidence of systemic long-term suppression after supplementation. ([Wikipédia][5])

**CONCLUSION:** Pathway activation in injury contexts does not imply chronic downregulation after supplementation.

---

### 🧠 **D. Feedback Via NAD⁺ Levels**

* When NMN increases NAD⁺, some **feedback gating** of synthesis pathways might occur temporarily, as part of normal metabolic regulation.
* However, these feedback loops **do not shut off endogenous production permanently** — they respond to current NAD⁺ demand and return to baseline after levels normalize. ([PMC][3])

**CONCLUSION:** Regulatory adaptation is short-term and reversible.

---

## 📌 **3. What Happens After Stopping NMN? (Best Evidence)**

### ✔ **NAD⁺ Levels Return Toward Baseline**

The most rigorous clinical data shows that NAD⁺ levels increase with NMN and then **go back toward pre-supplement levels after the supplement is stopped**. ([PMC][2])

### ✔ **No Evidence of Worse-Than-Baseline After Cessation**

* Studies haven't shown that NAD⁺ levels or enzyme expressions drop *below* original baseline after stopping.
* Instead, homeostasis generally re-establishes itself as NAD⁺ demand and supply re-balance.

### ✔ **Short-Term Regulation vs Permanent Downregulation**

* Any change in enzyme activity or uptake mechanisms observed in research tends to be **context-dependent** (e.g., metabolic stress, different tissues) but not *irreversible downregulation* caused by supplementation.

---

## 📌 **4. Gaps & Research Needs**

💡 **What we still don’t know:**

* Long-term effects (>1 year) of high-dose or chronic NMN supplementation on NAD⁺ metabolism enzyme regulation.
* Tissue-specific responses (muscle vs brain vs liver).
* Whether subtle transcriptional changes occur that affect metabolic pathways long after stopping.

Most existing evidence remains **preclinical (animal, cell studies)** or short-duration human trials. ([PMC][3])

## 🧠 **Summary: Are Downregulations There or Not?**

| Potential Downregulation Mechanism          | Evidence Exists?                    | Permanent Effect After Stopping?          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **NAMPT suppression**                       | ❌ No evidence                       | ❌ Unlikely                                |
| **NRK/NMNAT downregulation**                | ⚠️ Tissue-specific adaptive changes | ❌ Not shown permanent                     |
| **Feedback via NAD⁺ levels**                | ⚠️ Possible short-term              | ❌ No long-term suppression shown          |
| **SARM1 activation from NMN/NAD imbalance** | ⚠️ Yes in specific models           | ❌ Not evidence of systemic downregulation |

**Takeaway:** *Scientific evidence to date does **not** support the idea that NMN induces persistent downregulation of endogenous NAD⁺ synthesis pathways after stopping.* At most, temporary adaptive regulation may occur as part of normal metabolic feedback. ([PMC][2])

---

## 📍 **Final Notes**

* Most clinical data is still early and limited in duration.
* Preclinical findings suggest adaptive regulation rather than permanent suppression.
* There is **no robust evidence** that NAD⁺ levels or synthesis capacity fall below baseline after stopping NMN.

If you want, I can go deeper into specific **enzyme expression data** (e.g., NAMPT, NMNAT, SIRT1) from individual studies so you can see how these pathways shift during and after NMN supplementation.
