For rectal administration of GENFERON® suppositories, the interferon alfa-2b component exhibits high bioavailability, exceeding 80%, which allows it to be absorbed into the systemic circulation and exert pronounced immunomodulatory effects throughout the body. This means over 80% of the interferon dose reaches the bloodstream unchanged, contributing to whole-body antiviral and immune responses, in addition to local effects at the administration site. Peak serum concentrations are typically achieved around 5 hours post-administration, with an elimination half-life of about 12 hours, supporting twice-daily dosing for sustained systemic activity. Benzocaine primarily provides local anesthetic effects with minimal systemic absorption, while taurine aids in local anti-inflammatory and regenerative actions, so the overall "whole-body" impact is driven predominantly by the interferon's >80% systemic bioavailability.
