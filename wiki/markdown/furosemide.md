### Pharmacological Actions of Furosemide
Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic primarily used for treating edema, hypertension, and conditions like heart failure or renal disease. Its main mechanism is inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water. It also affects proximal and distal tubules. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions, based on data from sources like DrugBank, StatPearls, and FDA labels. For each, I've included available time course data (onset, peak, and duration) where applicable, focusing on diuretic and related effects. These can vary by route of administration, patient factors (e.g., renal impairment), and dose. Times are averages for standard adult doses (e.g., 20-80 mg oral or IV).

- **Diuretic Effect (Primary Action: Increased Urinary Excretion of Water, Sodium, Chloride, Potassium)**: Inhibits electrolyte reabsorption, promoting natriuresis and diuresis. This reduces extracellular fluid volume.
  - Oral: Onset 30-60 minutes, peak 1-2 hours, duration 6-8 hours.
  - IV: Onset 5 minutes, peak 20-60 minutes, duration 2 hours.
  - IM: Onset 10-30 minutes, peak unknown (likely 1-2 hours), duration 4-8 hours.
  - SUBQ: Onset unknown (likely within 1 hour), peak unknown (median 4-5 hours based on bioavailability studies), duration 8 hours.
  - Influence: Leads to rapid fluid loss (up to 1-2 liters in responsive patients), but can cause dehydration if excessive. In renal impairment, duration prolongs (up to 24 hours total effect).

- **Electrolyte Imbalance Induction (Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, Hypomagnesemia, Hypocalcemia)**: Increases excretion of potassium, magnesium, and calcium; can cause hyponatremia via water loss.
  - Time Course: Mirrors diuretic effect (peaks within 1-2 hours post-dose), but cumulative with repeated dosing; effects like hypokalemia may manifest over days/weeks.
  - Influence: Risk of arrhythmias (e.g., due to low potassium/magnesium), muscle cramps, or metabolic alkalosis (from chloride loss and hydrogen ion shifts).

- **Venodilation and Preload Reduction**: Direct vasodilatory effect on veins, reducing venous return to the heart (beneficial in acute pulmonary edema).
  - IV: Onset within 5-15 minutes (faster than diuretic effect), peak 30 minutes, duration 2-4 hours.
  - Influence: Rapid relief of dyspnea in heart failure; lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure before significant diuresis occurs.

- **Antihypertensive Effect**: Reduces blood pressure via volume depletion and possible direct vascular effects.
  - Oral: Onset 1-2 hours, peak 4-6 hours, duration 6-8 hours per dose; full effect may take days with chronic use.
  - Influence: Lowers systolic/diastolic pressure by 10-20 mmHg in responsive patients; more pronounced in hypertension with edema.

- **Increased Uric Acid Retention (Hyperuricemia)**: Competes with uric acid for renal secretion, potentially precipitating gout.
  - Time Course: Acute rise within hours of dose, peaks 4-6 hours; chronic elevation with repeated use.
  - Influence: Can exacerbate gout attacks; risk increases with doses >80 mg/day.

- **Metabolic Effects (e.g., Hyperglycemia, Metabolic Alkalosis)**: Mild glucose elevation due to hypokalemia; alkalosis from bicarbonate retention.
  - Time Course: Onset 1-2 hours, peaks with diuretic effect; resolves as drug clears.
  - Influence: Worsens diabetes control; alkalosis can cause fatigue or confusion.

- **Ototoxicity (Hearing Loss, Tinnitus)**: High doses inhibit NKCC1 in the inner ear, causing reversible or permanent damage.
  - IV (rapid infusion): Onset minutes to hours, peak during infusion, duration variable (often transient, but permanent at >200 mg rapid IV).
  - Influence: Dose-related; higher risk in renal failure or with aminoglycosides.

- **Other Minor Actions**: Noncompetitive blockade of GABA-A receptors (at high concentrations, potential CNS effects like sedation); increased renal blood flow initially.
  - Time Course: Not well-defined for these; generally aligns with peak plasma levels (1-2 hours oral, 30 minutes IV).
  - Influence: Rare clinical relevance except in overdose.

Note: In renal or hepatic impairment, all effects prolong due to extended half-life. Maximum diuresis/electrolyte loss is greater than with thiazides but similar to other loop diuretics.

### Half-Life
- Normal renal function: 0.5-2 hours (average 1-1.5 hours).
- Renal impairment: Prolonged, up to 9-24 hours in severe cases (e.g., end-stage renal disease).
- Hepatic impairment: Doubled (e.g., up to 4-10 hours in cirrhosis).
- Neonates/Infants: 1.2-67 hours (highly variable, longer in prematures).
- Elderly: Slightly prolonged (e.g., 2-3 hours).

### Bioavailabilities by Route
Bioavailability varies widely due to absorption-limited kinetics and patient factors (e.g., gut edema in heart failure reduces it).
- Oral (tablets/solution): 10-100%, average 47-70% (commonly ~50-64%; higher with food, lower in uremia or severe edema).
- IV: 100%.
- IM: ~100% (similar to IV, but slightly delayed absorption).
- SUBQ: 99-112% (nearly complete, based on formulations like Furoscix).
- Sublingual: ~59% (slightly higher than oral, but similar kinetics).

### Dosages
Dosages are individualized based on response, condition, and renal function. Titrate to the minimum effective dose to minimize risks like electrolyte loss. Below are guidelines from sources like Drugs.com, Medscape, and FDA labels. All for adults unless noted; pediatrics: 1-2 mg/kg (max 6 mg/kg/day).

- **Safe Range (General)**: 20-600 mg/day oral/IV, divided doses. Start low (20-40 mg), increase gradually. Monitor electrolytes, weight, and renal function daily initially.
- **Minimum Effective Dose**: Varies; e.g., 20 mg oral for mild edema/hypertension; 40 mg IV for acute pulmonary edema. In responsive patients, 5-10 mg may suffice initially.
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: Up to 600 mg/day in severe/refractory cases (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, severe heart failure), but only under close monitoring. Individual doses: Max 200 mg IV per dose. Risks (dehydration, ototoxicity) rise >80-160 mg/day or with rapid IV infusion.
- **LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%)**: No human data (ethical reasons). Animal data: Oral rat 2600 mg/kg; IP rat 800 mg/kg; SC rat 4600 mg/kg. Human lowest published toxic dose (TDLo): 6.25 mg/kg (female, oral). Overdose threshold not fixed, but symptoms (severe hypotension, shock, renal failure) can start at 200-500 mg in sensitive patients.
- **When It Becomes Too Dangerous**: No exact threshold, but risks escalate at >200 mg single IV dose (ototoxicity) or >600 mg/day chronic (electrolyte imbalances, gout, renal damage). Dangerous in renal failure (prolonged effects), dehydration, or with ototoxic drugs. Overdose: Dehydration/electrolyte loss leads to shock; treat supportively (fluids, electrolytes). Signs of danger: Urine output >1 mL/kg/h unresponsive, severe hypokalemia (<3 mEq/L), or hypotension.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized dosing, as furosemide can interact with many drugs (e.g., NSAIDs reduce efficacy, digoxin increases arrhythmia risk with hypokalemia).
