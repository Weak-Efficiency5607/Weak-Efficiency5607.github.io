Yes, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) can be administered orally, though it is not the most common route due to potential degradation in the gastrointestinal tract by enzymes like pancreatic nucleases. Examples include sublingual delivery in preclinical vaccine studies, where it serves as an adjuvant to stimulate immune responses without being swallowed. In animal models, direct intraluminal administration into the small intestine (bypassing the stomach via surgical injection) has been used to induce intestinal effects, but this is not standard oral ingestion. Overall, oral routes are explored mainly in research for mucosal immunity or adjuvancy, often requiring formulations to enhance stability and efficacy.
