Here’s a **comprehensive, science-based summary of what is *known* (and not known) about Suprefort® — *Suprefort* (also labeled a peptide bioregulator) — specifically regarding **pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, dosages, safety, and toxicology**. **Important:** Suprefort is marketed as a **dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator**, not an approved pharmaceutical drug. Because of that:

* There is **no authoritative drug monograph with detailed pharmacokinetics like half-life, clear bioavailability, LD₅₀, or therapeutic index** in humans.
* Standard clinical pharmacology data (e.g., plasma concentration over time, oral vs sublingual bioavailability curves) are *not published in peer-reviewed literature*.
* It is **not officially classified as a drug**, so many typical pharmacological parameters simply *do not exist* in regulatory databases.

Below is everything that *can* be stated with current evidence/documentation, and *what cannot be answered meaningfully due to lack of data*.

## 1) **What Suprefort® Is (Mechanism / Pharmacological Actions)**

Suprefort® is a **peptide bioregulator** — a mixture of short peptides derived from pancreas tissue (often from young animals). It is **sold as a dietary supplement** intended to *support* pancreatic function. ([BiogenVita][1])

**Proposed pharmacological actions (from manufacturer/clinical study reports):**

1. **Supports pancreatic cell metabolism** by providing tissue-specific peptide fractions said to interact at a DNA level in cells. ([suprefort.com][2])
2. **Normalizes pancreatic enzyme activity** (suggested increase in digestive enzymes in small clinical sample). ([Anti Aging Peptides][3])
3. **Supports carbohydrate and lipid metabolism** by purportedly modulating gene expression in pancreatic tissue. ([peptidesco.bg][4])
4. **Associated with improved glucose control** in a small clinical study in diabetics (not independently peer-reviewed). ([Anti Aging Peptides][3])

   > *Note:* This is a supportive claim from experimental clinical reports, **not an established pharmacodynamic mechanism in regulatory pharmacology terms**.

These actions **are not standard receptor-mediated pharmacology** (as with drugs) — rather they are described in literature/marketing as *gene modulators or physiological supports*.

**What is *not* documented:**

* **Specific receptor targets**
* **Enzyme inhibition constants (e.g., IC₅₀)**
* **Clinical dose–response curves in humans**
* **Mechanistic pharmacodynamics with verified pathways**

## 2) **Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability)**

There are **no published pharmacokinetic studies** of Suprefort peptides in humans with validated measurements of:

| Parameter                               | Data Available? |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Oral bioavailability                    | ❌ Not published |
| Sublingual bioavailability              | ❌ Not published |
| Plasma C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub> | ❌ Not published |
| Volume of distribution                  | ❌ Not published |
| Metabolism / clearance                  | ❌ Not published |
| Half-life (t½)                          | ❌ Not published |

**Why this is likely undocumented:**
Short peptides given orally are usually **rapidly digested and degraded in the GI tract** and, unless specifically formulated for stability, are unlikely to produce measurable intact peptide plasma levels. In general, short peptides not modified for stability often have **very short biological half-lives (minutes to low hours)** due to proteolytic degradation and renal clearance. ([PMC][5])

So, in **absence of specific data**, we *cannot provide numeric pharmacokinetic values*.

---

## 3) **Bioavailability by Route**

Suprefort is marketed primarily in **oral capsule** and **sublingual (lingual drop)** forms:

* **Oral capsules:** standard digestive absorption — no published bioavailability measurements. ([peptidesco.bg][4])
* **Sublingual form:** marketed with *claimed* higher bioavailability/speed of onset than oral because peptides can enter through oral mucosa — **no clinical PK data exist** to support numeric bioavailability percentages. ([COSMOLL.ORG][6])

**No validated values** exist for absolute bioavailability via either route.

---

## 4) **Dosage Recommendations in Literature / Commercial Information**

These are **manufacturer suggestions**, not regulatory therapeutic doses:

### **Capsule Form (oral):**

* **Typical adult dose:**
  1–2 capsules **1–2 times daily with meals** (usually before eating) for 30 days (often repeated in cycles every few months). ([peptidesco.bg][4])
* Each capsule often contains ~**10 mg** peptide complex A-1. ([BiogenVita][1])

### **Lingual (sublingual) Form:**

* **Common recommendation:**
  10–20 drops (~10 mg active/day) under tongue **2–3 times a day**, 5–15 min before meals. ([shop-npcriz.lv][7])

These dosing ranges **are for supplement use only, not pharmaceutical dosing**.

---

## 5) **Safety & Toxicology**

### **General Safety**

* Suprefort is marketed as **well-tolerated with no known side effects** and **no formal contraindications** beyond allergy or pregnancy/lactation in some product labeling. ([peptidesco.bg][4])

### **Toxicology / LD₅₀**

* There are **no published LD₅₀ values** for Suprefort (or pancreas peptide mixtures) in humans or animals.
* The concept of **LD₅₀ applies to single chemical entities**, not complex peptide mixtures without regulatory toxicology studies.
* Because Suprefort contains short peptides that resemble endogenous peptides, marketing materials typically claim low toxicity, but **this has not been independently validated**.

**No data exist for:**

* **Minimum effective dose (ED₅₀)** in humans
* **Toxic dose thresholds**
* **LD₅₀ in animals or humans**
* **Therapeutic window / safety margin**

---

## 6) **Typical Pharmacological Onset & Duration**

From clinical reports (not rigorous PK studies):

* In small clinical observations, favorable effects on enzyme activity or glucose levels were noted within **5–10 days** of starting a course (~1–2 capsules twice daily) in patients with pancreatic dysfunction/diabetes. ([Anti Aging Peptides][3])

⚠️ These are **clinical observation timelines**, *not pharmacokinetic half-life measurements*.

## **Important Clarifications**

* Suprefort is **not an approved drug**; it lacks regulatory pharmacology characterization.
* Claims about mechanisms (gene interaction, metabolic regulation) are **theoretical or based on limited/industry-sponsored research**, not accepted mainstream pharmacology.
* Numerical values for half-life, bioavailability, LD₅₀, therapeutic index, etc., **are not available in scientific literature**.

If you need, I can help explain **why peptide supplements like this generally *lack standard pharmacokinetic data*** and how peptide drugs *are studied* in clinical pharmacology.
