Your question **mixes very different products that share the name “Ovagen”**, and the scientific literature and product information are NOT consistent between them. Before answering, it’s important to clarify this:

1. **Ovagen peptide bioregulator** — a *research-grade tripeptide (Glu-Asp-Leu, ~375 Da)* sold for laboratory and dietary-supplement research use, *not an approved drug* for humans or animals outside research. ([LimitlessBioChem][1])
2. **Ovagen 25 mg Tablet containing clomifene** — a **prescription ovulation-stimulating medication** used in fertility treatment (clomifene citrate). ([1mg][2])
3. **Ovagen veterinary FSH product** — a veterinary follicle-stimulating hormone preparation for cattle. ([pdf.hres.ca][3])

Because your question asks for **pharmacological actions, kinetics, dosages, half-life, bioavailability, LD50, safety ranges**, etc., those kinds of data **only exist for approved pharmaceutical agents (like clomifene)** — *not* for “Ovagen peptide” products that are research chemicals or dietary supplements.

## 1) **If you mean the peptide “Ovagen” (Glu-Asp-Leu, liver bioregulator)**

### **Pharmacological Actions (research context)**

The peptide is *purported* to have tissue-specific regulatory effects in liver and digestive tissues. Reported actions in experimental/limited human contexts include:

* Hepatocyte support, liver regeneration and detoxification processes, normalizing metabolic and digestive functions. ([peptidi.info][4])
* Modulation of gene expression in target tissues by interacting with cellular transcriptional machinery. ([exploring-peptides.com][5])
* Possible cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects via regulation of stress and redox pathways in cell models. ([BioLongevity Labs][6])

**Important:** These are biological *research observations*, not clinically validated pharmacodynamic endpoints.

### **Pharmacokinetics**

There is **no reliable published data** on:

* **Half-life** in plasma/organ systems. Medical literature does *not* document elimination half-lives for this peptide. ([exploring-peptides.com][5])
* **Bioavailability** (oral or injected) — peptides this small may be degraded in the gut; absorption characteristics aren’t well documented.
* **Routes** — research protocols mention oral capsules (dietary supplement context) and injection (SC/IM) in experimental settings, but no standardized characterization exists. ([peptidedosages.com][7])

### **Dosage**

Commercial (non-regulated) products may state doses (e.g., 25–50 mg capsules once or twice daily for “liver support”), but these are **not medically approved dosages**, and efficacy/safety are *not established*. ([exploring-peptides.com][5])

Some research-protocol examples (not clinical guidelines):

* **Injected peptide**: ~0.5–4 mg per injection daily or every other day from reconstituted vials — *used in research settings* (not an approved regimen). ([peptidedosages.com][7])

### **Safety, Toxicity, LD₅₀**

There are **no official toxicology studies, LD₅₀ values, or regulatory safety profiles** for this peptide in humans or animals. As a research chemical:

* It’s *not FDA or EMA approved* for therapeutic use.
* Toxicity and overdose thresholds are **not established in the literature**.

**Therefore, giving a minimum effective dose, maximum safe dose, LD₅₀, or dangerous threshold values is not possible with scientifically supported data.** Any dosing seen online is anecdotal and not medically validated.

## 2) **If you mean “Ovagen 25 mg Tablet” containing clomifene citrate**

This is a **completely different drug** (fertility medication). It has clinical pharmacology, including:

### **Mechanism**

Clomifene increases release of gonadotropins (FSH, LH) by blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to ovulation induction. ([1mg][2])

### **Pharmacokinetic Information (clomifene)**

*(typical for the clomifene drug class — note specific values from standard references)*

* **Bioavailability**: oral (high, but exact percent not well quantified in open sources).
* **Half-life**: prolonged (around ~5–7 days common for clomifene and its active isomers) — *this is typical for clomifene citrate, although precise product labeling is preferred*.
* **Metabolism**: hepatic.

### **Clinical Dosage**

* Typical therapeutic regimen for inducing ovulation is **25–50 mg orally daily for 5 days**, often starting on day 5 of the cycle, adjusted by clinician. ([1mg][2])

### **Safety / Toxicity**

* **Side effects**: headaches, nausea, breast discomfort, hot flushes, visual disturbances. ([1mg][2])
* **Overdose/Toxicity**: serious toxicity includes ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; exact LD₅₀ is not clinically relevant for therapeutic use.
* **Contraindications**: pregnancy, liver disease, estrogen-dependent tumors. ([1mg][2])

## 3) **If you mean the veterinary FSH probiotic marketed as Ovagen**

This product contains **FSH from ovine pituitary extract** and is used for ovulation/superovulation protocols in cattle. Its pharmacology is typical for **gonadotropin injections** in veterinary reproduction:

* Stimulates follicle maturation and estrogen synthesis. ([pdf.hres.ca][3])
* Administered by **intramuscular injection** at regimented intervals; no human pharmacokinetic data is applicable.

## **Important Safety Notes**

* The **peptide Ovagen is a research chemical/dietary supplement product**, *not an approved drug* — no rigorous pharmacology, toxicology, or dosing guidelines exist.
* Dosage regimens found in online peptide forums are **not medical recommendations** and are not supported by clinical evidence.
* For the **clomifene medication**, dosing and safety thresholds should *only be provided by a qualified clinician*, and the drug must be used per prescription.
