Prednisone (CAS 53-03-2) is a synthetic corticosteroid prodrug that is metabolized to its active form, prednisolone, in the liver. It primarily exerts glucocorticoid effects but can have mineralocorticoid activity at high doses. Below is a comprehensive overview of its pharmacological actions, including time-related values (e.g., onset, peak, and duration where available) to illustrate how each action influences over time. These are based on general corticosteroid pharmacology, as specific per-action timings are not always distinctly separated in sources; instead, they align with overall pharmacokinetics. I've provided as many quantitative values as possible from reliable sources.

### Pharmacological Actions and Time-Related Influences
- **Anti-inflammatory action**: Prednisone inhibits pro-inflammatory signals by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing the production of mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes via phospholipase A2 inhibition, decreasing capillary permeability, and limiting leukocyte migration to inflammation sites. This leads to reduced swelling, redness, and pain.  
  - Onset: 1-2 hours after oral administration.  
  - Peak effect: 1-2 hours.  
  - Duration: 18-36 hours, with effects building over hours to days for genomic changes (e.g., gene expression alterations inhibiting NF-Kappa B). Short-term non-genomic effects (e.g., decreased vasodilation) occur rapidly within hours, while longer-term promotion of anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10 takes hours to days.

- **Immunosuppressive action**: At higher doses, it suppresses immune responses by inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis, demargination, and overall immune system activity, including decreasing lymphocyte volume and function. This is useful for autoimmune conditions but increases infection risk.  
  - Onset: 1-2 hours.  
  - Peak effect: 1-2 hours.  
  - Duration: 18-36 hours, with cumulative effects over days for sustained immunosuppression (e.g., higher doses >40 mg/day lead to prolonged immune suppression). Genomic effects (e.g., inhibition of inflammatory transcription factors) influence over hours to days.

- **Antineoplastic action**: Induces cell death in immature lymphocytes and inhibits glucose transport/phosphorylation, potentially slowing abnormal cell growth in conditions like leukemia.  
  - Onset: Hours to days, as it involves gene expression changes.  
  - Peak effect: Not specifically quantified, but aligns with plasma peak at 1-2 hours.  
  - Duration: Effects persist 18-36 hours per dose, with cumulative impact over treatment courses.

- **Antiemetic action**: Blocks cerebral innervation of the emetic center by inhibiting prostaglandins, reducing nausea (e.g., in chemotherapy).  
  - Onset: 1-2 hours.  
  - Peak effect: 1-2 hours.  
  - Duration: 18-36 hours.

- **Mineralocorticoid action (at high doses)**: Binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, causing sodium retention and potassium excretion, leading to fluid/electrolyte imbalances.  
  - Onset: Within hours for acute effects.  
  - Peak effect: 1-2 hours.  
  - Duration: 18-36 hours, with risks increasing over extended high-dose use (e.g., days to weeks).

### Half-Life
The elimination half-life of prednisone is 2-3 hours, while its active metabolite prednisolone has a half-life of 2.1-3.5 hours (up to 3-4 hours in adults and 1-2 hours in children). In liver disease, it may be prolonged.

### Bioavailabilities
- **Oral route**: 80-100%, with rapid absorption (Tmax 1-2 hours for immediate-release; 6-6.5 hours for delayed-release).  
- **Other routes**: Prednisone is primarily oral, but its metabolite prednisolone has ~70% bioavailability orally; intravenous administration (as prednisolone or equivalent) achieves 100% bioavailability. Bioavailability may increase in cirrhosis due to reduced metabolism.

### Dosages
Dosages vary by condition (e.g., inflammation, allergies, autoimmune diseases) and should be individualized, taken with food, and tapered to avoid adrenal insufficiency.  
- **Minimum effective dose**: 5 mg/day orally (e.g., for maintenance in chronic conditions).  
- **Safe range**: 5-60 mg/day initial dose; long-term maintenance typically 5-20 mg/day to minimize risks.  
- **Maximum without high risks**: <40 mg/day; doses ≥40 mg/day are considered high and increase adverse effects like osteoporosis, hypertension, and infection risk.  
- **LD50**: Not established for humans (ethical reasons); animal data includes oral LD50 in mice of 1680 mg/kg for prednisolone acetate. Human toxic dose low (TDLO) is 9 mg/kg over 2 weeks in men and 14 mg/kg over 13 days in women.  
- **When it starts to become too dangerous**: Doses >40 mg/day or prolonged use (>2-3 weeks at high doses) raise toxicity risks (e.g., Cushing's syndrome, adrenal suppression). Overdose symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, hyperglycemia) can occur at >40 mg/day; acute overdose may require supportive care, but no specific lethal threshold is defined—risk escalates with cumulative exposure.
