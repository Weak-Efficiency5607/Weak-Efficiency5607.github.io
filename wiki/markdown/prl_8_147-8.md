Here is a list of possible complete chemical structure names (IUPAC names) for PRL-8-147, based on the speculative modifications I outlined earlier. These are all hypothetical analogs closely related to the known structure of PRL-8-53 (methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate). I've included the likely hydrochloride salt form where applicable, as PRL-8-53 is typically reported as the HCl salt.

1. **Different ester group (ethyl ester)**  
   Ethyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

2. **Different ester group (isopropyl ester)**  
   Isopropyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

3. **Modification to the amine substituent (N-ethyl-N-benzyl)**  
   Methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(ethyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

4. **Modification to the amine substituent (N-benzyl-N-propyl)**  
   Methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(propyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

5. **Additional substituent on the benzyl ring (para-chloro)**  
   Methyl 3-(2-((4-chlorobenzyl)(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

6. **Additional substituent on the benzyl ring (para-methoxy)**  
   Methyl 3-(2-((4-methoxybenzyl)(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

7. **Change in the ethyl linker (alpha-methyl branch)**  
   Methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)propyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)  
   (or more precisely: methyl 3-(1-(benzyl(methyl)amino)propan-2-yl)benzoate (hydrochloride))

8. **Shift in benzoic acid substitution position (para position)**  
   Methyl 4-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)

9. **Amide instead of ester (N-methyl amide)**  
   N-Methyl-3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzamide (hydrochloride)

10. **Hydroxy/methoxy addition on the chain (alpha-methoxy)**  
    Methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)-1-methoxyethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride)  
    (or more precisely: methyl 3-(1-(benzyl(methyl)amino)-2-methoxyethyl)benzoate (hydrochloride))

These names follow standard IUPAC conventions for the core scaffold in Hansl's patented series. Again, all are purely speculative—there is no evidence confirming any of these as the actual structure of PRL-8-147. It could be one of these minor variations (or something entirely different within the same chemical class) that Dr. Hansl deemed more potent but never publicly disclosed.
