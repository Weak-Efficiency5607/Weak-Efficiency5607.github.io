Here’s a clear and honest overview **of what is (and is not) known scientifically about *Prostalamin*** — based on available product, supplement, and scientific information. Importantly, *Prostalamin is not a well-characterized pharmaceutical drug in mainstream pharmacology*: it is typically marketed as a **dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator** for prostate support, with **no established pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or regulatory drug approval** in major jurisdictions like the FDA or EMA. There is **no clinical pharmacology data (half-life, bioavailability, LD50, precise mechanism) published in peer-reviewed scientific literature for Prostalamin itself**. ([peptide-products.com][1])

## 1) **What Prostalamin *Is***

Prostalamin (sometimes spelled *Prostalamin® Classic* or *Prostalamin peptide bioregulator*) is marketed as a **natural peptide supplement** derived from animal prostate tissue (proteins and nucleoproteins) intended to support prostate and genitourinary function. ([peptide-products.com][1])

**Main claimed actions** (from supplement descriptions):

* Supports prostate cell metabolism and regeneration
* May relieve painful urination (dysuria) and improve urinary function
* May improve erectile function and pelvic floor muscle tone
* Claimed to accelerate recovery from prostatitis
* Used for early prostate adenoma and urodynamic support
* Claimed to improve spermatogenesis and treat oligospermia
* Claimed benefits in cases of partial androgen insufficiency ([peptide-products.com][1])

**Importantly:**

* These claims are **not established by rigorous clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals**.
* The product is sold as a **dietary supplement** in most markets, **not as a licensed pharmaceutical**.

## 2) **Pharmacological Actions — What Is *Claimed***

Because Prostalamin is a *supplement* and not a regulated drug, there are **no standardized pharmacological action profiles** in published clinical pharmacology databases. However based on manufacturer/marketing materials:

| Claimed Effect                                | Basis                                                              | Scientific Evidence                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Improves prostate cell metabolism             | peptides broken down to amino acids used for new protein synthesis | **no clinical PK/PD data**                                                         |
| Anti-inflammatory effect                      | modulation of inflammatory processes is claimed                    | Some concept of peptides affecting cell signalling, but **no rigorous human data** |
| Support for spermatogenesis / sexual function | peptide supply to tissue                                           | Not clinically validated                                                           |
| Relieves urinary symptoms                     | tissue-specific effect on prostate and bladder                     | Not proven in controlled trials                                                    |
| “Selective action on genitourinary cells”     | product packaging claims                                           | Not scientifically established                                                     |

**Evidence level:** observational / manufacturer claims only — **no standard clinical pharmacology validation**.

For more context on peptide bioregulators generally — some prostatic peptide extracts (e.g., *Prostatilen* from Russian literature) are described with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in experimental and some clinical reports, but even these lack well-controlled modern pharmacokinetic profiling. ([Eco-Vector Journals Portal][2])

## 3) **Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability, etc.)**

There are **no authoritative pharmacokinetic studies for Prostalamin** available in scientific literature or regulatory drug databases. Therefore:

###  **Half-Life**

* **Not established**: No published values for plasma half-life or tissue distribution.

###  **Bioavailability**

* **Not established**: Oral absorption, systemic bioavailability, and tissue targeting have not been documented.

###  **Time to Effect**

* Supplement claims suggest effects over **days–weeks**, with courses of 10–15 days typical. But there is **no pharmacokinetic measurement** of onset of action.

**Why this matters**
Pharmacological compounds require controlled measurement of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion — and those simply *don’t exist* for Prostalamin.

---

## 4) **Dosage — Official Product Recommendations (Supplement Labels)**

These reflect **product labeling**, not regulatory dosing guidelines.

Typical recommended use on product packaging:

* Take **1–3 capsules/tablets 2–3 times daily**
* 10–15 minutes before meals
* Course duration: **10–15 days**
* Repeat course recommended in **3–6 months** ([peptide-products.com][1])

This is **not clinical guidance** but marketing directions.

---

## 5) **Toxicity, Safety, LD50, Dangerous Levels**

There are **no published acute or chronic toxicity studies** for Prostalamin.

###  **Half Lethal Dose (LD50)**

* **Not available**: no toxicology studies exist in peer-reviewed literature or regulatory toxicology resources.

###  **Side Effects / Safety**

Manufacturer claims suggest “**no side effects, no intoxication, do not accumulate in the body, no withdrawal syndrome**.” But these are **unverified marketing claims** without independent evidence.

###  **High-Dose Risk**

* No known thresholds of harm.
* As a protein/peptide supplement, risk of allergic reactions or immunogenic responses is plausible, especially with animal-derived extracts, but not quantified.

###  **Drug-like Toxicity Data**

* No regulatory reporting of serious adverse events exists in recognized databases like FAERS or EudraVigilance.

## 6) **Summary — Scientific / Clinical Evidence Level**

| Category               | Known / Established        | Unknown / Not Established             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Basic product claims   | Manufacturer assertions    | Scientific clinical validation        |
| Mechanism of action    | *Hypothetical / marketing* | Verified molecular pharmacology       |
| Half-life              | —                          | Not measured                          |
| Bioavailability (oral) | —                          | Not measured                          |
| Dosing (effective)     | Supplement labeling        | Clinical efficacy evidence            |
| Safety / LD50          | —                          | Not established in toxicology studies |

---

## 7) **Comparison to Drugs with Known Pharmacokinetics**

To illustrate why this matters: bona fide drugs (e.g., prostaglandins like alprostadil, prostacyclin analogs) have well-documented half-lives and dosing regimens derived from clinical studies. For example, alprostadil has a terminal half-life of **5–10 minutes after IV dosing**, and its systemic pharmacokinetics are defined. ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][3])

By contrast, **Prostalamin has *no such data***.

---

## Bottom Line

**Prostalamin is a marketed peptide supplement for prostate support, not an approved pharmaceutical with validated pharmacology.**
There is **no reliable, published scientific data** on its:

* pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, Tmax, Cmax)
* bioavailability (especially oral)
* dose-response relationships
* toxicity thresholds, LD50, or safety margins
* precise mechanisms of action defined in controlled studies

Claims about Prostalamin’s effects are **based on manufacturer descriptions and traditional peptide bioregulator concepts**, not modern clinical pharmacology evidence.

If you’re considering this product for a medical condition (e.g., prostatitis, BPH, sexual dysfunction), **consult a licensed healthcare provider** — especially since lack of regulatory evaluation means safety and interactions are not well documented.
