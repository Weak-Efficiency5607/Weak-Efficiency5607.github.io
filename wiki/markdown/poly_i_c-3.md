Other non-injection routes for administering polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) to humans have been explored primarily in preclinical and early-stage research, often as an adjuvant in vaccines. These methods aim to leverage mucosal immunity while avoiding needles for better patient compliance and reduced risk of needle-related issues. Keep in mind that poly I:C is not yet widely approved for routine human use, and most data come from animal models or limited human trials, but the following alternatives show promise for safety based on available studies:

- **Sublingual administration**: This involves placing the formulation under the tongue for absorption through the oral mucosa. It's considered safe and non-invasive, with studies in non-human primates (like cynomolgus macaques) demonstrating no significant adverse effects while eliciting strong immune responses when combined with antigens like SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Safety assessments in mice and macaques also support its tolerability, avoiding systemic toxicity often seen with injections.

- **Intranasal administration**: Delivered as a nasal spray or drops, this route targets the respiratory mucosa and has been used to adjuvant vaccines, such as against influenza. It's generally safe, with research showing it induces interferon responses without central nervous system issues, and it's effective for pulmonary immunity. Combined with mucosal vaccines, it protects against infections like influenza without notable safety concerns in preclinical models. This method is particularly relevant for respiratory pathogens.

- **Eyedrop (ocular) administration**: Applied as drops to the eye, this has been tested as an inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvant. Studies indicate it's safe and effective for inducing systemic and mucosal immunity, with no reported ocular irritation or systemic side effects in animal models, making it a convenient needle-free option.

- **Transmucosal routes (e.g., oral-intranasal combinations via nanocarriers)**: Advanced formulations like nanocarriers enable delivery through the mouth or nose without degradation. These are designed for needle-free vaccines and show low toxicity in preclinical settings, enhancing accessibility for mass immunization.

These routes prioritize ease of self-administration and mucosal protection, but human clinical data is still emerging. Always consult medical professionals for any experimental use, as individual responses can vary.
