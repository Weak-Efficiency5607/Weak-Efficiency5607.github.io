Here is a comprehensive *pharmacological profile* of **sirukumab (CNTO-136)** based on available clinical and pharmacokinetic literature. **Note:** sirukumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that *has never been approved for clinical use*, and detailed toxicology (such as LD₅₀ in humans, oral bioavailability, and maximum tolerated doses) is **not publicly available**. Many parameters are *not determined or not applicable* for large-molecule biologics like sirukumab. Where data are available (mostly from clinical trials), I’ve included them below with citations.

---

## **1) Mechanism of Action / Pharmacological Actions**

**Primary action:**

* **Direct neutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6)**: Sirukumab is a *fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody* that binds with very high affinity to circulating IL-6 and prevents IL-6 from interacting with its receptor (IL-6R), thereby blocking IL-6 mediated signaling (including JAK/STAT pathways). ([MedPath][1])

**Downstream biological effects (pharmacodynamic actions):**

* **Reduction of acute-phase reactants (e.g., CRP):** CRP levels drop significantly (mean decreases ≈80-90% from baseline) within ~1–2 weeks after dosing. ([PMC][2])
* **Modulation of immune cell counts:** Clinical studies indicate decreases in white blood cell counts (including neutrophils) and platelets were observed with some regimens. ([PubMed][3])
* **Effects on CYP enzymes:** By neutralizing IL-6 (which suppresses CYP expression), sirukumab *may* increase the metabolic activity of CYP3A, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 for at least ~6 weeks after a single dose, affecting substrate drug pharmacokinetics. ([PubMed][4])

## **2) Pharmacokinetics (PK)**

### **Routes of Administration**

Sirukumab has *not* been developed for oral use.

* **Intravenous (IV)** (clinical studies used IV infusions)
* **Subcutaneous (SC)** (investigated; similar to other mAbs)
* **Oral bioavailability:** *Negligible / not applicable* for monoclonal antibodies — large biologics cannot be absorbed intact through the gut. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5])

### **Absorption**

* After **SC administration (25-100 mg)**:

  * Median time to peak concentration (Tₘₐₓ): ~3–5 days. ([PubMed][6])
  * SC bioavailability (F): ~81-95% depending on dose and injection device. ([PubMed][7])

### **Distribution**

* Volume of distribution is *limited*, typical of monoclonal antibodies (≈vascular + interstitial spaces).

  * Central V₁: ~3.28 L; peripheral V₂: ~4.97 L in IV studies. ([PubMed][8])

### **Elimination & Half-Life**

* **Terminal elimination half-life (t₁⁄₂):**

  * **IV:** median ~18.5–29.6 days after single doses up to 10 mg/kg. ([PubMed][8])
  * **SC:** ~15–19 days in healthy subjects; ~16 days reported in patients. ([PubMed][7])

### **Clearance**

* Approximately **0.36 L/day** (IV) in healthy subjects; relatively slow clearance typical of IgG1 mAbs. ([PubMed][8])

### **Steady-State**

* Steady-state serum levels are generally reached by ~12 weeks with repeated dosing. ([PMC][2])

## **3) Dosing Regimens Studied**

Sirukumab dosing in clinical studies for RA typically followed SC or IV regimens similar to other biologic therapies. There is *no regulatory‐approved dosing*, so all figures below are from clinical trials:

### **Subcutaneous dosing in RA (Phase II/III studies)**

* **25 mg q4 weeks (every 4 weeks)**
* **50 mg q4 weeks**
* **100 mg q4 weeks**
* **100 mg q2 weeks (every 2 weeks)**
  These varied regimens were explored in RA patients; higher doses tended to show greater efficacy. ([JNJ.com][9])

### **Intravenous dosing (Phase I/Phase I/II)**

* Single doses of **0.3, 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg** IV infusion were tested for safety & PK. ([PubMed][8])

---

## **4) Pharmacodynamic Timing**

* **CRP reduction:** significant decreases observed within **~1–2 weeks** after dosing and sustained for many weeks. ([PMC][2])
* **Alteration of CYP enzymes:** effects on CYP probe drugs were noted up to **≥6 weeks** after a single high SC dose. ([PubMed][4])

---

## **5) Toxicology, Safety & Limits**

### **Toxicology / LD₅₀**

* **Classical LD₅₀ (acute lethal dose) values in humans**: *Not available.*

  * Therapeutic proteins like sirukumab are generally not evaluated for LD₅₀ in humans due to ethical issues; biologics are **not given orally**, and toxicity is evaluated via clinical adverse events rather than LD₅₀.
  * Preclinical toxicology in cynomolgus monkeys identified **no adverse effects at doses up to 50 mg/kg weekly** (no observed adverse effect level, NOAEL), but these are *non-equivalent to human LD₅₀*. ([cdn.clinicaltrials.gov][10])

### **Safety Profile (from clinical studies)**

* Common adverse events in trials: infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mild respiratory infections, elevated lipids. ([JNJ.com][9])
* Serious infections and lab abnormalities were noted at higher doses similar to other IL-6 pathway inhibitors. ([PubMed][3])
* Some Phase III trials showed a **signal for increased mortality** in treated patients, contributing to the program’s termination. ([MedPath][11])

### **Maximum / Minimum Doses (clinical context)**

* **Lowest studied IV dose:** 0.3 mg/kg single dose. ([PubMed][8])
* **Highest studied IV dose:** 10 mg/kg single dose. ([PubMed][8])
* **Typical SC doses in RA studies:** 25–100 mg every 2–4 weeks. ([JNJ.com][9])
* Doses beyond these have *not* been systematically studied for safety in humans.

## **6) Bioavailability Summary**

| Route    | Bioavailability       | Notes                                                                               |

| **SC**   | **~81-95%**           | High bioavailability typical for mAbs; depends on formulation/device. ([PubMed][7]) |
| **Oral** | **Negligible**        | Large protein not absorbed intact. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5])                    |

## **7) General Notes**

* **Monoclonal antibodies like sirukumab** have distinctly different pharmacological profiles compared to small molecules — with long half-lives, limited tissue distribution, and elimination via proteolytic catabolism rather than renal clearance. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5])
* Detailed toxicity metrics such as LD₅₀, *maximum tolerated dose (MTD)*, or *oral bioavailability* are typically *not established* for therapeutic antibodies and are not clinically relevant.
* Sirukumab’s development was discontinued, so much of the clinical safety and regulatory data remain unpublished or incomplete. ([MedPath][11])
