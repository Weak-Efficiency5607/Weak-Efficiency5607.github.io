### Common Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

Most UTIs are lower tract infections (cystitis) and primarily cause local urinary symptoms. Upper tract infections (pyelonephritis) add systemic symptoms. Symptom frequency varies by infection type, patient age, sex, and complicating factors, but here are the most evidence-based symptoms with approximate prevalence in uncomplicated cases in adult women (the most commonly affected group):

| Symptom                          | How Common (Approximate % of Cases) | Notes |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| **Pain or burning when urinating (dysuria)** | Very common (80–95%) | Almost always present in uncomplicated cystitis; often the most prominent symptom. |
| **Frequent urination (frequency)** | Very common (70–90% | Patients feel the need to urinate often, even with small volumes. |
| **Sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency)** | Very common (70–90%) | Often feels impossible to hold; classic triad with dysuria + frequency is >90% predictive of UTI in women. |
| **Lower abdominal / pelvic / suprapubic pain** | Common (50–70%) | Pressure or cramping over the bladder area. |
| **Cloudy, bloody, or strong-smelling urine** | Common (30–60%) | Blood (hematuria) is visible in about 30–50%; strong odor is frequent but not universal. |
| **Feeling tired or unwell (malaise)** | Common in moderate cases (30–50%) | General fatigue or shakiness, especially if the infection is more severe. |
| **Fever, chills, flank pain, nausea/vomiting** | Less common in simple UTI (5–20%); much more common if kidneys are involved (50–80% in pyelonephritis) | These indicate possible kidney infection and require urgent care. |

### Anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure or loss of interest in activities)

**Not a recognized symptom of UTI** (essentially 0% directly caused by the infection itself).

Anhedonia is a core symptom of **depression** and some other psychiatric conditions. Acute bacterial UTIs do not directly cause anhedonia. However:

- Recurrent or chronic urinary symptoms (including recurrent UTIs or interstitial cystitis-like conditions) are associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety in some studies.
- The chronic pain, frequent disruption, and helplessness from repeated infections can contribute to low mood or even clinical depression over time, where anhedonia could then appear as part of that depression.
- In elderly patients or severe infections, UTIs can sometimes trigger acute confusion/delirium or restlessness, but true anhedonia is not described.

So while anhedonia is not a symptom of the UTI itself, people with frequent or long-standing urinary tract problems sometimes report depressive symptoms (including reduced pleasure/interest) because of the impact on quality of life.

If you are experiencing anhedonia along with urinary symptoms, it is much more likely that the anhedonia is related to depression or another mental-health issue rather than being directly caused by the infection. Both conditions deserve separate medical evaluation.
