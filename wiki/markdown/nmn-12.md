Based on an extensive review of recent studies (up to 2026) from sources like PubMed, ScienceDirect, Nature, MDPI, and others, there is evidence for possible temporary downregulations in NMN-related pathways during supplementation, but no persistent effects after discontinuation. Here's a structured summary:

### Evidence of Downregulations During NMN Supplementation
- **NAMPT (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)**: This rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway can show adaptive downregulation in response to exogenous NMN, as NMN bypasses the need for NAMPT-mediated synthesis. Preclinical studies (e.g., in high-fat diet mouse models from Yoshino et al., 2011) indicate that NMN restores NAD+ levels without requiring upregulation of NAMPT, and in some cases, feedback mechanisms reduce NAMPT expression to maintain homeostasis. For instance, in liver tissue of obese mice, NMN led to a slight decline in NAMPT activity, but this was compensatory and improved insulin sensitivity overall.
- **Other Enzymes/Pathways**: No consistent downregulation of NMNAT (NMN adenylyltransferase) or downstream NAD+-consuming enzymes like sirtuins or PARPs is reported. In fact, NMN often enhances sirtuin activity by boosting NAD+. However, in specific contexts like neurodegeneration models (e.g., Di Stefano et al., 2015, and reviews from 2023), excess NMN (if not fully converted to NAD+ due to low NMNAT) can upregulate pro-degenerative pathways like SARM1, leading to NAD+ depletion rather than downregulation.
- **Clinical/Preclinical Context**: Human trials (e.g., short-term NMN at 250–1000 mg/day) show NAD+ peaks followed by plateaus, suggesting adaptive feedback (e.g., reduced endogenous NAMPT reliance), but no pathological downregulation. In mice (Mills et al., 2016), long-term NMN (300 mg/kg for 12 months) mitigated age-related declines without causing enzyme suppression; instead, it preserved or enhanced metabolic pathways.

### Persistence After Stopping NMN
- No evidence of lasting downregulations post-discontinuation. Studies indicate reversibility: NAD+ and enzyme levels (e.g., NAMPT) return to baseline within days, as feedback inhibition lifts once exogenous NMN clears (half-life ~1–2 hours). For example, in aging mouse models (Yoshino et al., 2011), benefits like improved glucose tolerance persisted briefly after stopping, but no sub-baseline drops or suppressed NAMPT were observed.
- Risks are minimal in healthy individuals; exceptions include rare cases of NMNAT deficiency, where unconverted NMN might transiently activate SARM1 post-stopping, but this resolves quickly and isn't a downregulation per se.

In summary, temporary adaptive downregulations (primarily NAMPT) may occur during use to prevent NAD+ overload, but they are not present or persistent after stopping, based on available data. Long-term human studies are still limited, so monitoring is advised.
