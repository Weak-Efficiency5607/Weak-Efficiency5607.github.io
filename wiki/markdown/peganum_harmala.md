### Pharmacological Actions of Peganum harmala
Peganum harmala (commonly known as Syrian rue) contains bioactive β-carboline alkaloids, primarily harmine, harmaline, harmalol, harmol, and tetrahydroharmine, along with quinazoline alkaloids like vasicine and vasicinone. These compounds contribute to its diverse pharmacological effects, supported by in vitro, in vivo, and some clinical studies. The plant has been used traditionally for various purposes, but modern research focuses on its alkaloids' mechanisms. Below is a comprehensive list of actions, with quantitative values where available (e.g., IC50 for inhibition, effective concentrations). Time-related data (onset, duration) is limited and mostly from harmine/harmaline studies, as the plant's effects are alkaloid-driven. Onset and duration can vary by route of administration, dose, and individual factors.

#### 1. **Monoamine Oxidase-A (MAO-A) Inhibition (Neuroprotective)**
   - **Mechanism**: Reversible inhibition of MAO-A, increasing monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine). This underlies neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.
   - **Values**: Harmine and harmaline inhibit MAO-A with IC50 values of ~5-20 nM (highly potent). Harmine shows strong binding to serotonin 5-HT2C and dopamine D2 receptors via molecular docking.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset ~20-60 min orally; duration 2-8 hours (dose-dependent). Effects peak at 1-2 hours, contributing to sustained neuroprotection in models like hypobaric hypoxia.
   - **Evidence**: Inhibits ROS accumulation; neuroprotective in Parkinson's models by reducing oligokinesia and rigidity.

#### 2. **Antidepressant**
   - **Mechanism**: MAO inhibition elevates monoamines; harmine reduces haloperidol-induced catalepsy and shows activity in Porsolt's forced swim test.
   - **Values**: Effective at 10 mg/kg in rats (comparable to amitriptyline); IC50 not specified, but harmine hydrochloride at 4.5-40 mg/kg shows dose-dependent effects.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset 30-60 min orally; duration up to 6-8 hours. In chronic models, effects build over days.
   - **Evidence**: Pronounced in behavioral despair tests; harmine at low doses (2.5-10 mg/kg) eliminates catalepsy.

#### 3. **Antiparkinsonian**
   - **Mechanism**: Reduces rigidity and oligokinesia; antihypoxic effects protect against neuronal damage.
   - **Values**: Effective at 10 mg/kg in rats (reduces Parkinson's symptoms); harmine at 4.5-40 mg/kg.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset ~30 min; duration 4-5 hours (half-life influences sustained effect).
   - **Evidence**: Eliminates haloperidol-induced catalepsy; comparable to standard drugs.

#### 4. **Antihypoxic**
   - **Mechanism**: Enhances oxygen utilization in brain tissue.
   - **Values**: Harmine hydrochloride at 4.5-40 mg/kg effective in hypobaric hypoxia tests.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset 20-30 min; duration up to 5 hours.
   - **Evidence**: Pronounced in rat models.

#### 5. **Antibacterial**
   - **Mechanism**: Increases ROS, damages cell membranes/walls, disrupts cytoplasm, inhibits DNA synthesis and biofilm formation.
   - **Values**: MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) 0.5-16 mg/mL against Gram-positive/negative bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli). Harmine/harmaline MIC ~0.25-1 mg/mL.
   - **Time Influence**: Effects observed in 24-48 hour assays; in vivo resolution of symptoms in 9-15 days at 5 mg/kg.
   - **Evidence**: Effective against drug-resistant strains; used traditionally for infections.

#### 6. **Antifungal**
   - **Mechanism**: Similar to antibacterial (membrane disruption, ROS induction).
   - **Values**: MIC 0.5-4 mg/mL against Candida spp. and Aspergillus; harmaline IC50 ~0.1-0.5 mg/mL.
   - **Time Influence**: 24-72 hour inhibition in assays.
   - **Evidence**: Inhibits violacein production in fungi.

#### 7. **Antiviral**
   - **Mechanism**: Interferes with viral replication (e.g., inhibits HSV, influenza, HPV); modulates cellular pathways.
   - **Values**: IC50 6-28 µM for harmine against HPV-positive cells; effective against HSV-1 at 50-100 µg/mL extracts.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset in hours; duration up to 24 hours in cell cultures.
   - **Evidence**: Inhibits enterovirus 71 and herpes simplex; β-carbolines block viral nucleic acid replication.

#### 8. **Antiparasitic/Anthelmintic**
   - **Mechanism**: Disrupts parasite metabolism; inhibits violacein and motility genes.
   - **Values**: Effective at 5 mg/kg in vivo (cures leishmaniasis in 15 days); MIC 0.1-1 mg/mL against protozoa.
   - **Time Influence**: Symptoms resolve in 9-15 days at daily dosing.
   - **Evidence**: Used for coccidiosis and leishmaniasis in animals.

#### 9. **Anticancer/Cytotoxic**
   - **Mechanism**: Induces apoptosis (caspase-3 activation), disrupts cell cycle (G2/M arrest), stabilizes microtubules, inhibits migration/invasion, reduces angiogenesis.
   - **Values**: IC50 1-52 µg/mL for extracts against various cancer lines (e.g., HeLa, MCF-7); harmine IC50 6-28 µM. LD50 in brine shrimp 61-567 µg/mL (cytotoxicity indicator).
   - **Time Influence**: Effects in 24-72 hours in vitro; apoptosis peaks at 48 hours.
   - **Evidence**: Active against cervical, breast, ovarian cancers; harmine reduces metastasis.

#### 10. **Anti-inflammatory**
   - **Mechanism**: Inhibits cytokine release, albumin denaturation; reduces edema.
   - **Values**: 63-75% inhibition at 200 mg/kg (comparable to diclofenac/indomethacin); IC50 ~49 µg/mL in assays.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset 1-3 hours; duration up to 24 hours in paw edema models.
   - **Evidence**: Effective in carrageenan-induced inflammation.

#### 11. **Antioxidant**
   - **Mechanism**: Scavenges DPPH radicals; increases cellular antioxidants.
   - **Values**: IC50 49 µg/mL (DPPH); 5x more potent in nanocapsules (IC50 30 µg/mL).
   - **Time Influence**: Rapid in vitro (minutes); sustained in vivo.
   - **Evidence**: Reduces lipid peroxidation.

#### 12. **Hallucinogenic/Psychoactive**
   - **Mechanism**: CNS stimulation via MAO inhibition and receptor binding.
   - **Values**: Effective at 25-50 mg harmine; higher doses toxic.
   - **Time Influence**: Onset 20-90 min orally; peak 1-2 hours; duration 3-8 hours.
   - **Evidence**: Used in ayahuasca; causes euphoria, hallucinations.

#### 13. **Other Actions**

   - **Antihypertensive/Vasorelaxant**: Reduces blood pressure (10-150 mg/kg extracts).
   - **Analgesic/Antinociceptive**: Reduces pain in formalin tests (100 mg/kg).
   - **Abortifacient/Emmenagogue**: Traditional use; high doses risky.
   - **Time Influence (General)**: For most systemic effects, onset 20-60 min orally; duration 2-8 hours.

### Half-Life
- **Harmine**: 1-7 hours (varies by study); ~99-147 min in liver microsomes; 1.49-4.78 hours in ayahuasca contexts.
- **Harmaline**: ~2 hours; 147 min in microsomes.
- **Harmalol/Harmol**: Longer, up to 48 hours for metabolites.
- Plant extracts: Elimination within 24 hours; half-life 2-5 hours for key alkaloids in blood.

### Bioavailabilities
- **Oral (Harmine)**: Low (1.09%); rapid metabolism to harmol. Relative bioavailability of harmine HCl ~112.7% (faster absorption orally vs. other routes).
- **Oral (Harmaline)**: Higher (17.11%); metabolized to harmalol.
- **General Plant Extracts**: Low due to first-pass metabolism; improved in formulations (e.g., nanocapsules enhance by 1.2-3x). pH and Na+-dependent transport via OATPs/OCTs; MRP2 efflux reduces absorption. Co-administration with inhibitors (e.g., probenecid) increases harmine bioavailability ~2x.

### Dosages
Dosages vary by compound, route, and purpose; based on animal/human data. Human data is limited; traditional use involves 3-6 g seeds (containing ~150-300 mg alkaloids). Therapeutic doses are generally safe; high doses risk neurotoxicity.

- **Safe Range**: 100-200 mg/kg extracts orally (non-toxic in chronic rat studies); harmine/harmaline <25 mg human equivalent for non-hallucinogenic effects. LD50 >3 g/kg for methanol extract (safe up to 3 g/kg acute).
- **Minimum Effective**: Varies; e.g., 5 mg/kg for antiparasitic (in vivo resolution in days); 10 mg/kg for antidepressant/antiparkinsonian; 25 mg harmine for mild CNS stimulation.
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: ~50-100 mg/kg extracts; harmine <3 mg/kg (symptoms start at 3 mg/kg). Avoid >150 mg/kg chronic (minor organ changes).
- **LD50**: 
  - Methanol extract: >3 g/kg oral (rats).
  - Total alkaloids: 350-501 mg/kg oral (mice/rats).
  - Harmine HCl: 87 mg/kg IP (rats); moderately toxic.
- **When It Becomes Too Dangerous**: >200 mg/kg extracts or >3 mg/kg harmine (tremors, convulsions, hallucinations, bradycardia, hypothermia). Acute >500 mg/kg risks death; chronic >300 mg/kg risks liver enzyme elevation, vascular congestion. Neurotoxicity (ataxia, agitation) at high doses; avoid with MAOIs/tyramine. Fatality rare but reported at "handful of seeds" (~10-20 g).
