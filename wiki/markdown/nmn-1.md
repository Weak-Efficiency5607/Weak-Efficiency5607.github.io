# Background: NMN and NAD+ Biosynthesis

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a key NAD⁺ precursor produced by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting step of the mammalian NAD⁺ salvage pathway[\[1\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5668137/#:~:text=Nicotinamide%20mononucleotide%20,on%20metabolic%20complications%20and%20other). There is theoretical concern that high NAD⁺ or NMN levels could feedback-inhibit NAMPT. Indeed, some reviews speculate that excess NMN “may induce a ‘feedback inhibition effect’ on NAMPT, inhibiting the formation of NAD⁺”[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9495723/#:~:text=concentrations%20of%20NMN%20may%20induce,Indeed%2C%20the). However, this notion remains unproven in experiments. In contrast, the bulk of current studies show that exogenous NMN does *not* suppress NAMPT – often it increases or restores NAMPT in stressed or disease models. We summarize recent human, animal, and cell studies examining whether oral or systemic NMN alters expression of NAMPT or related NAD⁺-biosynthetic enzymes.

## Animal Studies: NMN Supplementation Often Raises or Restores NAMPT

In rodent models, NMN supplementation has typically been shown to **increase** NAMPT mRNA or protein levels, especially under conditions where NAMPT was suppressed. For example, in a rat model of inflammatory arthritis, long-term NMN feeding (75–150 mg/kg/day) *upregulated* NAMPT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Immunofluorescence and PCR assays confirmed higher NAMPT expression in NMN-treated arthritic rats versus controls[\[3\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576921004926#:~:text=increasing%20Th17%2FTreg%20cells%20ratio,immune%20milieu%20through%20the%20up). The authors concluded that “long-term NMN supplement could … reshape the immune milieu through the up-regulation of NAMPT”[\[3\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576921004926#:~:text=increasing%20Th17%2FTreg%20cells%20ratio,immune%20milieu%20through%20the%20up). Likewise, in a rat hemorrhagic shock model, NMN treatment given during resuscitation *further enhanced* NAMPT mRNA in liver and kidney (versus shock alone)[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at). There was only a trend toward increased NAMPT with shock; NMN boosted it significantly above that level. Notably, in sham (healthy) animals NMN did not change NAMPT, but in injured animals NMN *restored* or raised NAMPT expression[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at).

Similarly, in a mouse model of alcohol-induced liver injury, NMN injections (300–500 mg/kg) reversed the alcohol-driven decline in hepatic NAMPT protein. In alcoholic mice, NAMPT and NMNAT protein levels were reduced by ethanol exposure; NMN “effectively restored” both NAMPT and NMNAT to normal levels[\[5\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357478/#:~:text=effectively%20restored%20the%20protein%20expression,levels%20and%20the%20NAD%2B%2FNADH%20ratio). In other words, rather than downregulating the enzyme, NMN reversed its injury-induced suppression. These animal examples indicate that NMN either has no suppressive effect on NAMPT or can even upregulate it under stress. We found **no evidence** in animal studies that oral NMN causes enduring downregulation of NAMPT or other NAD⁺ enzymes; in fact, NMN often compensates for declines in these enzymes under pathological conditions.

## In Vitro Studies: NMN Upregulates NAMPT under Stress

Cell culture studies likewise report that NMN does not suppress NAMPT. For instance, Deng *et al.* treated mouse brain endothelial (bEnd.3) cells with NMN in the presence of oxidative stress (H₂O₂). They found that NMN “inhibit\[ed\] the NF-κB p65 inflammatory signalling pathway *and increase\[d\] the expression of the enzymes NAMPT, VEGF and eNOS*”, protecting the cells from damage[\[6\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33340447/#:~:text=this%20study%2C%20we%20found%20that,induced%20oxidative%20stress%20and). Again, NMN upregulated NAMPT. The study concluded that NMN reduced oxidative stress partly by raising NAMPT levels[\[6\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33340447/#:~:text=this%20study%2C%20we%20found%20that,induced%20oxidative%20stress%20and). We did not find any in vitro report where NMN treatment led to reduced NAMPT or related biosynthetic enzymes. Instead, most cell studies note NMN boosts NAD⁺ and its downstream effects (e.g. activating SIRT1) without evidence of suppressing the salvage machinery.

## Human Studies: Lack of Data on NAMPT Regulation

To date no clinical trials of NMN have directly measured NAMPT gene or protein levels in humans. Human NMN trials have mainly focused on safety and metabolic endpoints (e.g. circulating NAD⁺) and have not assessed tissue NAD⁺ enzymes. We are unaware of any published human data showing that NMN intake downregulates NAMPT or NAD⁺ biosynthesis. One recent perspective notes that intermittent dosing might be worth testing, and that potential feedback/inhibitory effects of chronic high-dose NMN remain speculative[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9495723/#:~:text=concentrations%20of%20NMN%20may%20induce,Indeed%2C%20the). In short, there is **no human evidence** that oral NMN suppresses NAMPT expression.

## Feedback Mechanisms and Theoretical Considerations

Theoretical NAD⁺-homeostasis models describe multi-tier feedback loops (the “NAD World” concept[\[7\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772665/#:~:text=phosphoribosyltransferase%20,mammalian%20aging%20and%20longevity%20control)[\[8\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772665/#:~:text=match%20at%20L837%20feedback%20loops,of%20this%20new%20concept%20and)) but do not provide direct evidence that NMN ingestion turns off NAMPT. NAMPT regulation is known to respond to circadian cues, inflammation, and metabolic stress; for example, age and chronic inflammation tend to *lower* NAMPT expression[\[9\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772665/#:~:text=match%20at%20L304%20%E2%80%9Cinflammaging%E2%80%9D%2C%20decreases,Such). However, exogenous NMN appears to bypass these issues rather than exacerbate them. Indeed, by supplying the NAD⁺ precursor directly, NMN may relieve the need for high NAMPT activity; but experiments suggest compensatory upregulation rather than downregulation. A recent review explicitly states that while high NMN *could* hypothetically feed back to inhibit NAMPT, this effect “has not been proven so far”[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9495723/#:~:text=concentrations%20of%20NMN%20may%20induce,Indeed%2C%20the). In fact, all studies we found showed stable or increased NAMPT after NMN, and some showed NMN inducing NAMPT expression via SIRT1 or other pathways[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at)[\[5\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357478/#:~:text=effectively%20restored%20the%20protein%20expression,levels%20and%20the%20NAD%2B%2FNADH%20ratio).

Importantly, NMN inherently bypasses NAMPT by entering cells downstream of that enzyme. Studies note that NMN (unlike nicotinamide) is “not subject to feedback inhibition” of NAMPT[\[10\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11205942/#:~:text=was%20retained%20in%20the%20body,not%20subject%20to%20feedback%20inhibition). This kinetic bypass may lessen any pressure for negative feedback. In contrast, the only way NAMPT expression is robustly lowered in these contexts has been via stressors (oxidative stress, alcohol, ischemia) – conditions under which NMN actually *restores* NAMPT[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at)[\[5\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357478/#:~:text=effectively%20restored%20the%20protein%20expression,levels%20and%20the%20NAD%2B%2FNADH%20ratio).

## Conclusion

Across animal models and cell studies, chronic NMN supplementation has **not** been observed to downregulate NAMPT or other NAD⁺-salvage enzymes. On the contrary, NMN often preserves or enhances NAMPT expression when it is pathologically reduced[\[3\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576921004926#:~:text=increasing%20Th17%2FTreg%20cells%20ratio,immune%20milieu%20through%20the%20up)[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at)[\[5\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357478/#:~:text=effectively%20restored%20the%20protein%20expression,levels%20and%20the%20NAD%2B%2FNADH%20ratio). No human trials have demonstrated any compensatory suppression of NAD⁺ biosynthetic genes with NMN. Speculative feedback mechanisms (e.g. an allosteric NMN “feedback inhibition” of NAMPT) remain unproven[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9495723/#:~:text=concentrations%20of%20NMN%20may%20induce,Indeed%2C%20the). In summary, current literature provides **no evidence** that oral NMN causes lasting downregulation of endogenous NAD⁺ enzymes. Rather, NMN supplementation tends to increase NAD⁺ availability without triggering compensatory reduction in NAMPT.

**Sources:** Recent in vivo and in vitro studies, along with reviews, consistently report that NMN either restores or raises NAMPT expression (e.g. in arthritic or ischemic rodents and endothelial cells[\[3\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576921004926#:~:text=increasing%20Th17%2FTreg%20cells%20ratio,immune%20milieu%20through%20the%20up)[\[4\]](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/120182#:~:text=and%20H%29,in%20NAMPT%20protein%20expression%20at)[\[6\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33340447/#:~:text=this%20study%2C%20we%20found%20that,induced%20oxidative%20stress%20and)[\[5\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357478/#:~:text=effectively%20restored%20the%20protein%20expression,levels%20and%20the%20NAD%2B%2FNADH%20ratio)). Experts note only theoretical concern of feedback, which remains to be validated[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9495723/#:~:text=concentrations%20of%20NMN%20may%20induce,Indeed%2C%20the). No clinical data have shown negative feedback.
