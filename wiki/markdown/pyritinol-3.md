**Yes, pyritinol has several pharmacological actions that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) does not have—or exhibits only to a negligible or indirect extent.**  

Pyritinol is a semi-synthetic disulfide-linked dimer of pyridoxine, sharing some pharmacokinetic similarities (e.g., rapid absorption and short half-life) and overlapping roles in neurotransmitter support. However, its unique dimeric structure allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively and exert brain-specific effects, particularly in aged or impaired models. These include direct enhancement of cerebral metabolism, targeted cholinergic modulation, and vascular/antioxidant actions not seen with standard vitamin B6 supplementation.

Below are the key unique actions, with quantified percentages where available from studies (mostly in animal models, e.g., aged rats/mice). Vitamin B6 primarily acts as a coenzyme (via pyridoxal phosphate) in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis, but lacks these direct CNS-targeted, dose-dependent boosts.

1. **Significant increase in cerebral glucose utilization**  
   - Pyritinol induces a significant rise in glucose uptake and metabolism in key brain regions (striatum, cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum) in aged rats (at 200 mg/kg p.o.). This is a primary mechanism for its nootropic effects in cognitive impairment.  
   - Exact percentage increase not quantified in sources (described as "significant"), but this is not a direct action of vitamin B6, which supports glucose metabolism indirectly via systemic enzyme roles.

2. **Dose-dependent elevation of cortical cGMP levels** (cyclic guanosine monophosphate, linked to cholinergic and nitric oxide signaling for synaptic plasticity)  
   - Increases of **25%** (200 mg/kg p.o.), **42%** (600 mg/kg), and **71%** (1000 mg/kg) over 16–23 days in rats.  
   - This is specific to pyritinol and contributes to enhanced memory/learning; vitamin B6 does not produce comparable direct cortical cGMP boosts.

3. **Increase in blood ATP content** (enhancing cellular energy availability)  
   - Dose-related rises of **8%** (30 mg/kg p.o.), **17%** (100 mg/kg), and **20%** (300 mg/kg).  
   - Supports overall brain energy; not a quantified effect of vitamin B6 at therapeutic doses.

4. **Reduction of plasma viscosity and improvement in cerebral blood flow/circulation**  
   - Pyritinol decreases plasma viscosity and enhances perfusion, aiding oxygen delivery in cerebrovascular conditions.  
   - This vascular effect is unique and not shared with vitamin B6.

5. **Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS** (scavenging free oxygen radicals, membrane stabilization)  
   - Provides targeted neuroprotection against oxidative stress in brain tissue.  
   - Vitamin B6 has mild systemic antioxidant activity, but pyritinol's CNS-specific scavenging is more pronounced and distinct.

6. **Inhibition of GABAergic activity**  
   - Inhibits GABA binding to receptors (reducing affinity) and glutamate decarboxylase (decreasing GABA synthesis), promoting CNS activation.  
   - This is opposite to vitamin B6, which serves as a cofactor for glutamate decarboxylase (increasing GABA production).

7. **Targeted facilitation of cholinergic recovery**  
   - Restores high-affinity choline uptake in aged synaptosomes, increases choline acetyltransferase activity post-lesion, and facilitates recovery of cortical cholinergic deficits.  
   - While B6 supports acetylcholine synthesis indirectly, pyritinol's metabolite-specific effects on release and uptake in impaired models are more direct and restorative.

In summary, pyritinol's profile is more nootropic-oriented (cognitive enhancement in dysfunction) with quantified boosts in energy markers (e.g., 8–71% in ATP/cGMP) and metabolic/vascular effects absent in vitamin B6. These differences make pyritinol unsuitable as a simple B6 substitute but useful as an adjunct for brain-related conditions.
