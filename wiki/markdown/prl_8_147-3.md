The proposed structure for PRL-8-147—ethyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride—represents a close analog to the well-established structure of PRL-8-53, which is methyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride. To assess whether this could plausibly be the structure of PRL-8-147, I conducted a detailed analysis based on available patent data, chemical similarities, pharmacological context, and public discussions. Note that the exact structure of PRL-8-147 remains undisclosed in publicly accessible sources, often described as existing only in the inventor's private notes or as an unreleased variant. This limits verification to inference and plausibility rather than direct confirmation. Below, I break down the analysis step by step.

### 1. **Confirmation of PRL-8-53 Structure**
   - PRL-8-53 is consistently identified across chemical databases, vendor sites, and research discussions as the hydrochloride salt of the methyl ester: specifically, 3-[2-[methyl(phenylmethyl)amino]ethyl]benzoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride (also written as m-[2-(benzylmethylamino)ethyl]benzoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride).
   - **Molecular formula**: C18H21NO2 (free base), C18H22ClNO2 (hydrochloride salt).
   - **Key structural features**:
     - A benzoic acid core with a meta-substitution (position 3).
     - A side chain: -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)(CH2C6H5), where the nitrogen is tertiary with methyl and benzyl groups.
     - Esterified with a methyl group (-COOCH3).
   - This structure aligns with its description as a substituted phenethylamine derivative and matches the single human study from 1978, where it enhanced verbal memory retention. It is also noted for potential mechanisms involving dopamine potentiation, serotonin inhibition, and cholinergic interactions.

### 2. **Proposed Structure for PRL-8-147**
   - The suggested compound is ethyl 3-[2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]ethyl]benzoate hydrochloride, or m-[2-(benzylmethylamino)ethyl]benzoic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride.
   - **Molecular formula**: C19H23NO2 (free base), C19H24ClNO2 (hydrochloride salt). This adds one carbon and two hydrogens compared to PRL-8-53 due to the ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) instead of methyl.
   - **Structural comparison to PRL-8-53**:
     - **Core similarity**: Identical benzoic acid scaffold with the same meta-substituted side chain (-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)CH2C6H5). The only difference is the ester group: methyl (-CH3) vs. ethyl (-CH2CH3).
     - **Chemical class**: Both are esters of substituted aminoethyl meta-benzoic acids, fitting the general formula R1-C6H4-CH2-CH2-N(R2)R3, where R1 is -COOR4 (R4 = alkyl).
     - This minor variation (methyl to ethyl) is common in medicinal chemistry for analogs, as it can alter lipophilicity, metabolic stability, or bioavailability without changing the primary pharmacophore.

### 3. **Patent Context (US3870715A)**
   - The patent, granted in 1975 to Nikolaus R. Hansl, covers a series of these esters as spasmolytics, psychotherapeutic agents, and learning/memory facilitators.
   - **Relevant compounds listed**:
     - The methyl ester (PRL-8-53) is explicitly exemplified and tested for memory enhancement in animal models (e.g., maze tests, avoidance responses), showing improved acquisition and retention.
     - The ethyl ester is also explicitly claimed: "m-[2-(benzylmethylamino)-ethyl]benzoic acid ethyl ester." It appears alongside other variants like n-propyl, t-butyl, and benzyl esters.
     - No specific codes (e.g., "PRL-8-53" or "PRL-8-147") are assigned in the patent; these likely originated as internal lab designations from Hansl's work at Creighton University or Pacific Research Labs.
   - **Pharmacological overlap**: The patent attributes similar properties to the series, including low toxicity (LD50 ~500-700 mg/kg in mice) and memory facilitation. While the methyl ester is highlighted in examples, the ethyl variant is included without noted differences, suggesting it was considered part of the same therapeutic class.

### 4. **Evidence Supporting Plausibility**
   - **Analog rationale**: In drug development, ester variations often yield more potent or longer-acting compounds due to changes in hydrolysis rates or absorption. For instance, ethyl esters can be more lipophilic, potentially improving CNS penetration for nootropic effects. PRL-8-147 is repeatedly described as a "more potent" or "unreleased" variant of PRL-8-53, aligning with this pattern.
   - **Shared origin**: Both compounds stem from Hansl's research. PRL-8-147 is mentioned in nootropics communities as a follow-up, possibly synthesized before Hansl's death but never commercialized due to funding issues, a university feud, or sample destruction.
   - **No conflicting structures**: Extensive searches yielded no alternative proposed structures for PRL-8-147. It is absent from PubChem and other databases, reinforcing its undisclosed status but leaving room for the ethyl analog as a logical candidate.
   - **Nootropic community speculation**: Discussions often note PRL-8-147's superior memory/learning effects ("mother of all memory"), which could stem from minor tweaks like ester length.

### 5. **Evidence Against or Limitations**
   - **Lack of direct confirmation**: No source explicitly names the ethyl ester as PRL-8-147. The "147" designation doesn't correlate obviously with molecular weight, year, or other metrics (e.g., PRL-8-53's "53" might refer to a lab batch or arbitrary code).
   - **Patent breadth**: The patent includes many analogs (e.g., morpholino, piperidino, diethylamino variants), so PRL-8-147 could theoretically be another (e.g., propyl ester). However, the ethyl is the closest to the methyl in structure.
   - **Potency data gap**: While PRL-8-147 is called "more potent," the patent doesn't compare esters directly. Animal/human data focuses on the methyl. Anecdotal reports on PRL-8-53 (e.g., memory boosts at 5-20 mg) don't extend to 147.
   - **Development history**: Hansl's work stalled post-1978, possibly due to lack of FDA funding or institutional issues, leaving PRL-8-147 unstudied.

### 6. **Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, the proposed ethyl ester structure is highly plausible for PRL-8-147. It shares near-identical architecture with PRL-8-53, falls within the same patented series, and fits the description of a more potent analog through minor ester modification. However, without access to Hansl's private records or further disclosure, this remains an educated inference rather than verified fact. If new data emerges (e.g., from archived notes), it could confirm or refute this. For practical purposes in nootropics research, treating it as such aligns with available evidence.
