To address your request to identify the drugs used in the context of the provided text about "Resurrecting The Super Depression Drug" and MC5R blockers for depression and anxiety treatment, I will analyze the text, conduct web searches, and explore relevant sources to identify specific drugs or compounds mentioned. The text focuses on melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) blockers developed by Akhu Therapeutics, so I will prioritize finding information about these compounds and any related drugs.

### Step 1: Analyze User Intent and Key Information
The user’s intent is to identify specific drugs or compounds referenced in the provided text, which discusses MC5R blockers developed by Akhu Therapeutics for depression and anxiety. Key information to prioritize:
1. **Specific MC5R blockers**: Identify any named drugs or peptide compounds used as MC5R blockers.
2. **Context of use**: Confirm their application in depression and anxiety treatment.
3. **Development status**: Determine if these compounds have specific names or are still in development.
4. **Additional drugs**: Check for other melanocortin-related drugs mentioned in similar contexts.

The provided text mentions “a series of peptide compounds” designed to block MC5R but does not name specific drugs. I will search for more details about Akhu Therapeutics’ compounds and related melanocortin-based treatments.

### Step 2: Initial Analysis of Provided Text
The text highlights:
- Dr. Caurnel Morgan’s research on MC5R blockers since 2001.
- MC5R blockers showed significant efficacy in mouse models, improving depression symptoms in one hour and being three times more effective than traditional antidepressants.
- In April 2016, Akhu Therapeutics acquired a license for peptide compounds targeting MC5R for depression and anxiety treatment.
- No specific drug names are provided, only “peptide compounds.”

Since the text lacks specific drug names, I will search for:
- Akhu Therapeutics’ MC5R blockers and any named compounds.
- Other melanocortin-based drugs (e.g., MIF1, Nemifitide) mentioned in similar contexts.
- Recent developments or clinical trial data related to MC5R blockers.

### Step 3: Web Search for MC5R Blockers and Akhu Therapeutics
I’ll start by searching for information on Akhu Therapeutics and their MC5R blockers to identify specific compounds.

**Search Query**: “Akhu Therapeutics MC5R blockers peptide compounds depression anxiety”

**Search Results Analysis**:
1. **HuffPost Article (2016)**: Confirms Akhu Therapeutics, led by Dr. Caurnel Morgan, acquired a license for peptide compounds to block MC5R. No specific drug names are mentioned, but it notes the compounds were three times more effective than antidepressants in mouse studies and worked in one hour.[](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-this-the-solution-to-the-depression-epidemic_b_57ac86a4e4b08c46f0e4c639)
2. **TheBestBrainPossible.com (2016)**: Reiterates the same information about Akhu Therapeutics’ license for MC5R-blocking peptides. No specific drug names are provided.[](https://thebestbrainpossible.com/is-this-the-best-new-solution-to-the-depression-epidemic/)
3. **General Melanocortin Research**: Sources like PubMed and ScienceDirect discuss melanocortin receptors (MC1R to MC5R) and their role in stress, anxiety, and depression. They mention earlier melanocortin-based drugs like MIF1 (melanocyte-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting factor 1) and Nemifitide, but these are not MC5R-specific.[](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-this-the-solution-to-the-depression-epidemic_b_57ac86a4e4b08c46f0e4c639)

Since no specific MC5R blocker names are found, I’ll broaden the search to include other melanocortin-based drugs and check for updates on Akhu Therapeutics’ work.

**Refined Search Query**: “melanocortin-5 receptor blockers Akhu Therapeutics drugs depression anxiety”

**Search Results**:
- No new sources explicitly name Akhu Therapeutics’ peptide compounds. Most results echo the 2016 HuffPost and TheBestBrainPossible articles.
- A PubMed article on melanocortin receptors mentions MC5R’s role in stress responses but does not list specific blockers in clinical use.
- No clinical trial data or FDA approval records for Akhu Therapeutics’ MC5R blockers appear in recent searches, suggesting the compounds may still be in preclinical or early clinical stages.

### Step 4: Exploring Related Melanocortin-Based Drugs
The HuffPost article mentions MIF1 and Nemifitide as earlier melanocortin-based drugs for depression. I’ll investigate these to determine if they are MC5R blockers or relevant to Akhu’s work.

**Search Query**: “MIF1 Nemifitide melanocortin depression treatment”

**Search Results**:
1. **MIF1 (Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone Release-Inhibiting Factor 1)**:
   - Described as a naturally occurring molecule that inhibits melanocortin release in the brain. It was studied for depression but not specifically as an MC5R blocker.
   - MIF1 showed promise in early studies but was not patentable, limiting commercial development.[](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-this-the-solution-to-the-depression-epidemic_b_57ac86a4e4b08c46f0e4c639)
2. **Nemifitide**:
   - A synthetic analog of MIF1, developed to be patentable. It targets the melanocortin system and showed rapid antidepressant effects in phase II clinical trials (3-4 months of symptom relief after five days of treatment).
   - Not specifically an MC5R blocker; it acts more broadly on the melanocortin system. Development stalled due to patent and commercial issues, not lack of efficacy.[](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-this-the-solution-to-the-depression-epidemic_b_57ac86a4e4b08c46f0e4c639)
3. **Akhu Therapeutics’ Compounds**: No sources beyond 2016 provide specific names for their MC5R blockers. A 2016 press release quoted Dr. Morgan stating the compounds are protected by nine patent applications, but no drug names or trial updates are available.

### Step 5: Checking Clinical Trials and Recent Developments
To ensure I’m not missing newer information, I’ll search for clinical trials or updates on MC5R blockers.

**Search Query**: “MC5R blockers clinical trials depression anxiety 2025”

**Search Results**:
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: No active or completed trials list MC5R blockers or Akhu Therapeutics’ compounds for depression or anxiety as of 2025.
- **PubMed**: Recent studies on melanocortin receptors focus on MC4R (not MC5R) for obesity and stress-related disorders, with drugs like setmelanotide (an MC4R agonist, not a blocker). No MC5R-specific drugs are named.
- **X Posts**: No relevant posts mention MC5R blockers or Akhu Therapeutics. Posts about depression drugs focus on unrelated treatments (e.g., Rituximab, Tricoksagin, Cobenfy).

### Step 6: Cross-Checking Other Melanocortin Drugs
To be thorough, I’ll search for other melanocortin-based drugs that might be confused with MC5R blockers or related to Akhu’s work.

**Search Query**: “melanocortin receptor drugs depression anxiety”

**Search Results**:
- **MC4R Agonists**: Drugs like setmelanotide target MC4R for obesity, not depression. These are agonists, not blockers, and unrelated to MC5R.
- **Bremelanotide**: An MC1R and MC4R agonist used for sexual dysfunction, not depression or anxiety.
- **No MC5R-Specific Drugs**: Beyond MIF1 and Nemifitide, no other melanocortin-based drugs are consistently linked to depression treatment.

### Step 7: Conclusion and Verification
After extensive searching, the specific MC5R blockers developed by Akhu Therapeutics remain unnamed in available sources. They are described as “a series of peptide compounds” in preclinical development as of 2016, with no updates on clinical trials or FDA approval by 2025. Related drugs like MIF1 and Nemifitide are not MC5R-specific but target the broader melanocortin system. No other MC5R blockers are identified in the literature.

**Final Answer**

The provided text refers to a series of unnamed peptide compounds developed by Akhu Therapeutics to block the melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) for treating depression and anxiety. No specific drug names for these MC5R blockers are provided in the text or found in web searches. Related melanocortin-based drugs mentioned in similar contexts include:
- **MIF1 (Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone Release-Inhibiting Factor 1)**: A naturally occurring molecule that inhibits melanocortin release, studied for depression but not specific to MC5R.
- **Nemifitide**: A synthetic analog of MIF1, developed for depression, acting on the melanocortin system but not specifically targeting MC5R.

No other MC5R-specific drugs were identified in the searches.
