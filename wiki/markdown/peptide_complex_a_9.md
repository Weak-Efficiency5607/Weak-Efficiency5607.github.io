Here’s what is **scientifically and reliably known** about **Pielotax** — and, importantly, where *no good pharmacological data exists*. Based on available information, **Pielotax is not an approved medication** with established pharmacokinetics or toxicity values; rather it is marketed as a **dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator containing a “kidney peptide complex A-9”** with claimed effects on kidney tissue. ([pielotax.com][1])

## 🧪 What *Pielotax* Is

**Pielotax®** is described in product literature as a **natural peptide bioregulator** containing a complex of short peptides (peptide complex A-9) *intended to support kidney and urinary system function*. It is marketed for use in conditions like **urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, chronic pyelonephritis, nephropathy, and cystitis**, although it is **not recognized as a regulated drug** and most claims are *not supported by published pharmacological studies in humans*. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])

**Summary of proposed actions from product descriptions:**

* Normalizes metabolism in kidney tissues
* Regulates urinary system function
* Supports repair and regeneration of kidney cells
* Helps maintain filtration and excretion processes
  These actions are *reported in product marketing materials and supplement descriptions*, not clinical pharmacology references. ([pielotax.com][1])

## 📊 Pharmacological Actions — What Is *Claimed*

Since *Pielotax* is not a regulated drug, there are **no authoritative pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic data** (e.g., receptor binding, enzyme inhibition) in recognized scientific literature like PubMed or drug databases. However, based on product marketing:

**Reported/claimed actions:**

* *Supports kidney tissue cell metabolism and protein synthesis*
* *Helps reduce levels of urea and uric acid in blood*
* *Improves filtration and elimination of waste products*
* *Promotes cellular repair/regeneration in renal tissue*
  These are *supplement claims* with very limited or no scientific validation outside of proprietary clinical brochures. ([antiaging-systems.com][3])

There is one independent study (not directly about the marketed Pielotax product, but relevant to peptide complexes isolated from kidneys) showing that a **polypeptide complex from calf kidneys can stimulate kidney cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in rat kidney tissue cultures**, which *may correlate conceptually with peptide bioregulator claims* — but this is very preliminary and not specific to the marketed Pielotax formulation. ([PubMed][4])

## ⏱ Pharmacokinetic Data (Absorption, Half-Life, Bioavailability)

There are **no published pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., half-life, bioavailability) on Pielotax in humans or animals** in scientific literature or official drug references.

💡 **Why this matters:**

* Peptide supplements often have **very different absorption and metabolism** compared with conventional drugs
* Oral peptides can be broken down in the gut before absorption unless specially formulated
* Sublingual administration (as in the lingual version) is *claimed* to bypass some first-pass metabolism, but no quantitative data supports this for Pielotax A-9. ([Qi Supplements][5])

📌 **Conclusion on pharmacokinetics:**
There are **no trustworthy values** for:

* Time to onset of action
* Time to peak concentration (Tmax)
* Half-life (t½)
* Absolute or relative bioavailability (oral or sublingual)

Such data *simply do not exist in peer-reviewed publications or regulatory dossiers* for Pielotax.

## 💊 Dosage and Administration (Supplement Guidance)

Because Pielotax is marketed as a **dietary supplement**, recommended usage comes from product literature, not clinical guidelines:

**Capsule form:**

* Typically **1–2 capsules per day with meals**
* Standard course: **1–3 months**, may be repeated after a break
* Each capsule ~0.2 g contains ~10 mg of peptide complex A-9
* Typical regimen ~10-30 mg/day depending on source ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6])

**Lingual (sublingual) form:**

* ~10 drops under the tongue twice daily
* Each 1 mL contains ~10 mg peptide complex A-9
* Absorption claimed to be faster, but not scientifically quantified ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][7])

⚠️ **Important:** These are *supplement recommendations and marketing instructions*, not medically validated dose-response relationships.

## 🚫 Toxicity, LD50, Safety Thresholds

There are **no established toxicology studies, LD₅₀ values, or safety margins** for Pielotax in scientific literature, toxicology databases, or drug reference texts. No human clinical trials published with controlled safety data exist.

Because:

* It is **not a pharmaceutical drug**
* It has **no regulatory approval**
* It lacks peer-reviewed pharmacology or toxicology data

…there are **no reliable estimates for:

* Minimum effective dose
* Maximum tolerated dose
* LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of subjects)
* Onset of toxicity thresholds

If such values exist at all, they would only come from controlled toxicology studies — which have *not been published publicly* for Pielotax.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

👉 **Pielotax is a dietary supplement**, *not* an approved prescription medication.
👉 Claims about kidney regeneration, peptide-driven gene expression, and long-term metabolic effects are **not established in peer-reviewed human studies**.
👉 Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before using supplements, especially if you have a known kidney condition or are taking medications.
