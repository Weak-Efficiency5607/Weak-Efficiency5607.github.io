Prednisone (CAS 53-03-2) is a synthetic glucocorticoid widely used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Below, I provide a comprehensive overview of its pharmacological actions, their time course, half-life, bioavailability, dosage ranges, and toxicity considerations, supported by authoritative sources. The information is organized to address each aspect of your query systematically, with values where available, and includes recent insights where relevant.

### Pharmacological Actions of Prednisone
Prednisone is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver to its active form, prednisolone, which exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Its pharmacological actions are mediated through genomic (affecting gene transcription) and nongenomic (rapid, non-transcriptional) mechanisms. Below are the primary pharmacological actions, along with their mechanisms and approximate time courses where data is available:

1. **Anti-inflammatory Effects**
   - **Mechanism**: Prednisone (via prednisolone) binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, upregulating anti-inflammatory genes (e.g., annexin-1) and downregulating pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., those encoding IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB). It suppresses migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reverses increased capillary permeability.[](https://www.medicine.com/drug/prednisone/hcp)[](https://www.scbt.com/p/prednisone-53-03-2)
   - **Specific Effects**:
     - Reduces paw swelling in animal models (e.g., 86% inhibition at 12 mg/kg in sodium urate-induced swelling in mice).[](https://www.caymanchem.com/product/20677/prednisone)
     - Decreases mucosal TNF-α production, intestinal permeability, and NF-κB expression in various inflammatory conditions.[](https://www.scbt.com/p/prednisone-53-03-2)
   - **Time Course**:
     - **Onset**: Anti-inflammatory effects typically begin within hours (2–6 hours post-dose) due to rapid conversion to prednisolone and receptor binding.[](https://www.medicine.com/drug/prednisone/hcp)
     - **Peak Effect**: Maximal anti-inflammatory effects are often observed within 6–12 hours, depending on the condition and dose.[](https://www.medicine.com/drug/prednisone/hcp)
     - **Duration**: Effects may persist for 12–36 hours, correlating with the half-life of prednisolone (2–3 hours) and sustained receptor-mediated gene expression changes.[](https://www.medicine.com/drug/prednisone/hcp)

2. **Immunosuppressive Effects**
   - **Mechanism**: Prednisone reduces the activity and volume of the lymphatic system, decreasing granulocyte and lymphocyte activity. It inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, MCP-2, MCP-3, RANTES, TNF-α) and suppresses immune responses by altering T-cell and B-cell function.[](https://www.medicine.com/drug/prednisone/hcp)[](https://www.caymanchem.com/product/20677/prednisone)[](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/pharmacopeia/prednisone)
