Here is a **comprehensive pharmacological profile for peptide complex A-6** — more properly known as **A6 (also Å6)**, a short urokinase-derived octapeptide (sequence *Ac-KPSSPPEE-NH₂*) that has been studied as an antineoplastic/anti-metastatic agent and in early clinical trials. Note: *A6 is a research and investigational compound — it is not an approved drug in most countries.* ([cancer.gov][1])

## 📌 **1. Mechanism(s) of Pharmacological Action**

**Primary actions identified in preclinical/clinical research:**

1. **Modulation of CD44 activity**

   * A6 binds to CD44 (a cell surface adhesion receptor), alters its conformation, inhibits tumor cell migration/invasion, and activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) / MAPK signaling. ([PubMed][2])

2. **Anti-metastatic and anti-invasive effects**

   * A6 inhibits migration and metastasis of CD44-positive tumors in multiple models. ([PubMed][3])

3. **Anti-angiogenic properties**

   * Although less well quantified, A6 exhibited anti-angiogenic effects in early studies. ([PubMed][4])

4. **Anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclast effects**

   * A6 attenuates LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction by modulating NF-κB, AMPK, and Akt pathways in macrophage/osteoclast models. ([PubMed][5])

5. **Cell signaling modulation**

   * The peptide has upstream effects on CD44-mediated pathways affecting adhesion, migration, and survival. ([PubMed][3])

## 🕐 **2. Pharmacokinetics (PK)**

### **Absorption & Time to Peak**

* After **subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in humans**, **time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax)** ~ **0.5–2.1 hours**. ([PubMed][4])

### **Half-Life (t½)**

* In healthy human volunteers after s.c. injection, **terminal half-life ~1.4–1.8 hours**. ([PubMed][4])

### **Elimination**

* A6 is eliminated largely **unchanged in urine** (~78–95% depending on dose and regimen). ([PubMed][4])

### **Bioavailability**

* Exact absolute bioavailability values (especially oral) have *not been published in peer-reviewed A6 human studies* — but like most short peptides, A6 is likely poorly bioavailable orally unless modified (protease resistance, formulation strategies).
* In early human PK studies, only **subcutaneous administration was evaluated**. ([PubMed][4])

**Oral route:**

* Peptides like A6 are generally vulnerable to proteolytic digestion — unless specifically engineered for oral delivery, oral bioavailability is likely *very low*. Research exists exploring exceptions for other peptides but not specific quantification for A6. ([patents.google.com][6])

## 💊 **3. Dosage Information from Clinical Studies**

Human data exists only from early phase clinical trials:

### **Subcutaneous Dosing (Human Phase I)**

* Single doses: **15 mg up to 300 mg s.c.** were **safe and well-tolerated**. ([PubMed][4])
* Repeated s.c. dosing: **Up to 150 mg every 12 hours for 6 days** was tolerated. ([PubMed][4])

### **Clinical Oncology Trial Doses**

* In a randomized Phase II trial (ovarian cancer), daily s.c. injections of **150 mg (low) and 300 mg (high)** were used. ([PubMed][7])

### **Typical Research/Preclinical Doses (Animal Studies)**

* Murine tumor and bone loss models often used **~50–100 mg/kg s.c.** with biological effects reported. ([PubMed][2])

---

## ⚠️ **4. Safety, Toxicity & Maximum Tolerated Dose**

### **Human Safety Observations**

* **No dose-limiting toxicity was observed in early Phase I** trials up through 300 mg s.c. single dose. ([PubMed][4])
* No early immunogenic response (anti-A6 antibodies) detected. ([PubMed][4])

### **Toxic Dose / LD₅₀**

* **No published LD₅₀ values** exist for humans or standard animal toxicology data in peer-reviewed literature for the native A6 peptide.
* As a short peptide with rapid elimination and no serious toxicity up to high doses in early human trials, its **acute lethal dose** is unknown, and toxicity thresholds are not defined.

⚠️ This means: **LD₅₀ and toxicity curves are not established** — and inferring them would be speculative and irresponsible.

## ❗ **Important Considerations & Limitations**

🔹 **No oral A6 PK data in humans** — short peptides are generally poorly absorbed orally due to proteolysis. ([patents.google.com][6])
🔹 **Toxicology (LD₅₀, safety margins)** are not published — clinical dosing tolerability is limited to early, controlled settings. ([PubMed][4])
🔹 Mechanism details are primarily preclinical; **clinical efficacy data are mixed and not definitive.** ([PubMed][7])
🔹 Quantitative dose–response curves (e.g., EC₅₀, IC₅₀ for individual pathways in humans) are not generally available beyond cell models. ([PubMed][2])

## 📌 **Summary**

A6 is a short peptide with **anti-metastatic, anti-migratory, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory potential** acting mainly through **CD44 modulation** and related signaling pathways. It shows a **short half-life (~1–2 h)** after subcutaneous administration and **rapid renal elimination**. Human clinical data demonstrate safety up to hundreds of milligrams s.c., but **oral administration, bioavailability, and toxicity thresholds (LD₅₀) are not established**. ([PubMed][4])

If you want, I can help summarize typical **preclinical dose–effect relationships** (e.g., IC₅₀/EC₅₀ values for migration inhibition, signaling changes in cell models) in tabular form. Would you like that?
