The active ingredient in Tenoten® is affinity-purified antibodies to brain-specific protein S-100, applied to lactose monohydrate as a water-alcohol mixture at a concentration not exceeding 10⁻¹⁵ ng/g of the active form (for the adult formulation; the children's version uses 10⁻¹⁶ ng/g). Each tablet contains 0.003 g of this active component, along with excipients like lactose monohydrate (0.267 g), microcrystalline cellulose (0.03 g), and magnesium stearate (0.003 g). This is a homeopathic preparation, meaning the active ingredient is present in ultra-low, highly diluted doses (equivalent to homeopathic potencies such as C12, C30, and C200 or C50 in some descriptions).

### Pharmacological Actions
The claimed pharmacological actions are mediated by the antibodies modifying the functional activity of the S-100 protein, which is involved in coupling synaptic (informational) and metabolic processes in the brain, neuronal plasticity, and regulation of calcium-binding proteins. These actions are primarily based on manufacturer claims and clinical studies comparing it to conventional anxiolytics like amitriptyline, sertraline, and phenazepam, but without their sedative or muscle-relaxant side effects. No potent inhibitory effects on the central nervous system are reported. The following are all documented actions from available sources:

- **Anxiolytic (anti-anxiety)**: Reduces anxiety and emotional tension without causing drowsiness or muscle relaxation. Influences stress-limiting systems by providing GABA-mimetic effects, helping to restore balance in neurotransmitter activity.
- **Calming/sedative (mild)**: Promotes emotional stability and reduces irritability, particularly in neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders.
- **Nootropic**: Enhances cognitive functions, including learning, memory normalization, and attention. Supports neuronal plasticity and higher nervous activity.
- **Neuroprotective**: Protects brain cells in conditions of intoxication, hypoxia, or post-acute cerebral circulation disturbances (e.g., after stroke). Limits the area of brain damage and inhibits lipid peroxidation (oxidative stress).
- **Stress-protective**: Improves tolerance to psycho-emotional loads, reducing the impact of stress on the body.
- **Antidepressant**: Alleviates symptoms of depression, particularly in comorbid conditions like epilepsy or cognitive impairment.
- **Antiasthenic**: Reduces fatigue and asthenia (weakness), improving overall energy and mental performance.
- **Antiamnesic**: Counters memory loss or amnesia-like effects in stress or hypoxic states.
- **Antihypoxic**: Mitigates effects of oxygen deprivation on brain tissue.
- **Neurotrophic**: Supports neuronal growth and repair through modulation of S-100 protein, enhancing synaptic conjugation and metabolic processes.

These actions collectively influence brain function by regulating S-100 protein conformation, which plays a role in pathological anxiety states, neurodegenerative processes, and neuronal adaptability. Clinical studies indicate dose-dependent effects (e.g., anxiolytic action increases with higher doses in animal models, from 2.5 to 10 mL/kg equivalents), but human data lacks precise quantitative measures of influence due to the ultra-low doses. No measurable time-based values (e.g., onset of action, peak effect, or duration) are available, as the drug's effects are described as cumulative over days to weeks of use, with improvements in anxiety scores (e.g., Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) observed after 4-12 weeks in trials. The influence is generally supportive rather than acute, promoting long-term adaptation rather than immediate symptom suppression.

### Pharmacokinetics
Due to the ultra-low concentration of the active ingredient, pharmacokinetic studies are technically impossible using modern analytical methods (e.g., gas-liquid chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The active substance cannot be detected in biological fluids, organs, or tissues. Therefore:

- **Half-life**: Not available or measurable.
- **Bioavailability**: Not available or measurable. The drug is administered orally/sublingually (tablets held in the mouth until dissolved, not swallowed with food), but no data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion exists. Other routes (e.g., intravenous) are not used or studied.
- No data on time to peak concentration (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC), or clearance.

### Dosage
Tenoten® is taken sublingually (held in the mouth until fully dissolved, separate from meals). Dosages are based on clinical trials and manufacturer recommendations for adults (the standard Tenoten® formulation). There is a separate "Tenoten for Children" product with similar but adjusted dosing.

- **Recommended dosage**: 1-2 tablets, 2-4 times daily (total 2-8 tablets/day). In clinical trials, regimens included 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day) or 2 tablets 4 times daily (8 tablets/day) for somatoform or neurotic disorders; for children, 1 tablet 3 times daily.
- **Minimum effective dose**: 1 tablet twice daily (2 tablets/day), based on lower-end regimens showing anxiolytic effects in studies.
- **Safe range**: Up to 8 tablets/day (or higher in some extensions, but not recommended without supervision). No upper limit is strictly defined due to the homeopathic nature, but courses are typically 1-3 months, extendable to 6 months or repeatable after a 1-2 month break. Overdose has not been reported, even at higher intakes.
- **Adjustments**: Increase frequency/dose for severe symptoms (e.g., up to 4 times daily). For maintenance, lower doses suffice. In children (ages 3+ for the pediatric version), start at 1 tablet 1-3 times daily.

### Safety
Tenoten® is considered highly safe due to its ultra-low active ingredient concentration, with no reported side effects, drug interactions, tolerance, addiction, or withdrawal syndrome in clinical studies. It does not impair driving or machinery operation and lacks sedative, hypnogenic, or muscle-relaxant effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to components (e.g., lactose intolerance) and age under 18 for the adult formulation (use pediatric version for children). Safe in pregnancy/lactation based on low risk, but consult a physician. Compatible with anticonvulsants and other medications.
