1,3-Dihydro-2-benzofuran (Phthalane) -- Pharmacology and Toxicology
==================================================================

(1,3)-Dihydro-2-benzofuran (also called **phthalane** or 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran; CAS 496-14-0) is a simple bicyclic organic solvent/intermediate, not a pharmaceutical drug. It is *used in organic synthesis* (e.g. as an arylation reagent). Crucially, **no specific pharmacological activity** has been reported for this compound. In fact, safety data sheets state that phthalane "contains no substances which at their given concentration are considered hazardous to health", implying **no known receptor-mediated effects**. The *only* effects noted in exposure cases are general, non-specific CNS symptoms: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. In other words, phthalane acts like a typical organic solvent at high dose (causing central nervous system depression) rather than a targeted drug. (By contrast, one of its substituted derivatives -- the bicyclic "phthalane" core of citalopram/escitalopram -- is an antidepressant, but plain phthalane has none of those effects.)

-   **Pharmacological actions:** None known. **No agonist/antagonist activity** is reported for this compound. It does **not** bind known neurotransmitter receptors, enzyme targets, etc. Safety sheets explicitly report *no hazardous biological effects*. The only effects at high exposure are general CNS depression (e.g. as listed: headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea). There is no evidence of specific action on the 5‑HT, dopamine, adrenergic, or other systems.

-   **Onset/timing of effects:** Not studied. Because phthalane is not used as a drug, no controlled pharmacodynamic studies exist. One can presume that if ingested or inhaled, any effects (namely general drowsiness or irritation) would occur within minutes to hours as the compound is absorbed, similar to many solvents. However, we found *no data* on onset times or duration of action in animals or humans.

-   **Half-life (elimination):** No data available. We did not find any pharmacokinetic studies of phthalane. It is likely metabolized slowly to phthalic acid (oxidation of the benzofuran ring) and excreted, but no quantitative half-life in blood or tissues is reported. References (e.g. safety data and chemical handbooks) do not list any biological half-life for this compound.

-   **Bioavailability:** No data available. As an organic liquid with low water solubility, phthalane would presumably be **readily absorbed by inhalation** (its vapor pressure is not listed, but being a volatile liquid it can vaporize) and possibly moderately absorbed orally if ingested. However, no studies have measured its absorption or distribution. It is *not* administered as a drug, so **oral bioavailability in vivo is unknown**. Because it is oily and hydrophobic, one might expect rapid absorption via mucosa but no clinical data exist.

-   **Dosage (therapeutic/safe range):** Not applicable. Phthalane has no accepted medicinal use and no therapeutic dose. Therefore there is **no "minimum effective dose"** or "safe pharmacological range." It is simply a chemical reagent. Occupational or experimental exposure guidelines (if any) are not defined in published literature. For reference, a manufacturer's safety sheet notes *no ACGIH, NIOSH or OSHA exposure limits* for phthalane, reflecting its minimal regulation. In practice, one should **avoid any unnecessary exposure** (as with any solvent).

-   **Toxic dose and LD₅₀:** No data available. We found no published LD₅₀ (lethal dose 50%) for phthalane in any species. Safety documents confirm that *"LD50/LC50: Not available"*, and note *"no information found"* for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, etc.. This means no formal toxicity tests have been reported. Anecdotal sources do not provide an LD₅₀. By analogy to similar solvents, acute lethal doses would likely be on the order of grams per kg in animals, but that is speculation. In summary, **no quantitative toxicological values** (minimum lethal dose or LD₅₀) are known for (1,3)-dihydro-2-benzofuran.

-   **Onset of danger / risk of overdose:** Because phthalane is not used as a drug, there is no delineated "overdose" threshold. Danger would come from high concentration in inhalation or large ingestion, which could cause severe CNS depression (unconsciousness), respiratory failure, or aspiration into the lungs. There are no case reports in humans to define these levels. In effect, *any substantial acute exposure* (especially by inhaling concentrated vapor or swallowing significant volume of the liquid) could be dangerous. Standard chemical safety precautions should be followed: avoid breathing vapors, avoid skin contact, and treat it as a flammable hazard. (The safety sheet classifies it as a combustible/flammable liquid, so fire risk must also be managed.)

**Summary:** In summary, *no specific pharmacology is documented* for 1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran. It is merely an organic chemical intermediate. Consequently, there are **no reported values** for half-life, bioavailability, effective doses, or LD₅₀. Official safety data sheets explicitly show *"no substances... hazardous to health"* at normal concentrations and list *"LD50: Not available"*. The only noted effects of excessive exposure are general solvent-like symptoms (headache, nausea, drowsiness). Thus, from a pharmacological standpoint, (1,3)-dihydro-2-benzofuran has **no therapeutic actions**, and any risk comes only from non-specific toxicity at high doses.
