Here’s what can be reliably gathered **about Glandokort** — including what it *is*, what its claimed pharmacological actions are, and what established pharmacokinetic / safety data exist — based on currently available scientific and supplier information from published sources. **Important caveat:** *Glandokort is not a standard pharmaceutical drug with well-characterized pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxicity studies, or regulated dosage and safety data.* Most details come from product descriptions or small clinical reports in Russia and supplement sellers, **not from modern peer-reviewed drug research**. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

## 🧬 What Glandokort *Is*

**Glandokort** is marketed as a **peptide bioregulator supplement** containing a complex of peptides called **A-17**, derived from adrenal glands of young animals. It is promoted to *support adrenal gland function and endocrine balance* and is classified as a dietary supplement/bioregulator, not a verified pharmaceutical. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1])

### Claimed Pharmacological Actions

The advertised mechanisms (mostly from manufacturer/clinical reports) include:

* **Selective effect on adrenal gland cells**, supporting their metabolism and function. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])
* **Normalization of hormone production** — cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline — to help stress response and metabolism. ([uaepeptidesresearch.com][3])
* **Restoration of functional activity of the endocrine system** after stress, nutritional or environmental disruption. ([antiaging-systems.com][4])
* **Tissue-specific gene expression modulation** via short peptides—claimed in older Russian research on peptide bioregulators in general (not specific A-17 data). ([peptides1.ru][5])

**Important:** These actions are *claimed* based on limited clinical reports and theoretical bioregulator mechanisms — **not established by modern pharmacology standards**.

## ⏱ Pharmacokinetics — What We *Do Not* Know

For conventional drugs, pharmacokinetics include absorption, **bioavailability**, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. For Glandokort:

* **Bioavailability (oral)**: *No published human data exist* because Glandokort is not an approved drug with formal PK studies.
  Manufacturers claim that **sublingual (lingual) forms have faster and higher absorption** because they enter circulation via the oral mucosa without first-pass metabolism. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])
  However, there are **no validated bioavailability percentages** available.

* **Half-life**: *No reported half-life data* for A-17 peptides in the bloodstream are available in the literature.

* **Time-to-onset**: Claims by sellers suggest sublingual administration is faster than capsules, but no human trial data provide reliable onset times.

**Summary:** There’s *no peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data* (half-life, Tmax, Cmax, AUC) for Glandokort/A-17 peptides available.

## 💊 Dosage Information – Supplement Marketplace

Since Glandokort is marketed as a **supplement**, standard scientific dose-finding and toxicology (like ED50 or LD50) do **not** exist in regulatory literature. What follows are *recommended product dosages* from manufacturer/seller descriptions:

**Capsule Form (oral):**

* Typical: **1–2 capsules once or twice daily with meals**. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6])
* Dosage per capsule: ~**10 mg A-17 peptides** (so 20 mg per day with 2 capsules). ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6])
* Course duration: **30 days**, repeat after 1-2 months if needed. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6])

**Lingual (sublingual) Form:**

* Typical: **10 drops under tongue twice daily** (~10 mg active total per day). ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])
* Some sources suggest **5–6 drops 3–4 times daily** for up to 1 month. ([Bio Peptides][7])

These are *supplement manufacturer recommendations*, not evidence-based clinical regimens.

## ⚠️ Safety, Toxicity, LD50, and Adverse Risk

### **LD50 / Toxicity**

There are **no LD50 values, NOAEL, or formal toxicity studies** for Glandokort/A-17 peptides in accessible scientific literature. This is typical for supplements not regulated as drugs.

Some supplier materials and small clinical reports claim **no identified side effects** during routine use, but these are not robust toxicity studies. ([antiaging-systems.com][4])

### **Side Effects / Risks**

* **No well-documented adverse events or toxicity profiles exist**.
* **Contraindications noted by sellers:** pregnancy, breastfeeding, individual intolerance. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2])
* As with any biologically active supplement, **allergic reactions** or unknown interactions with medications are theoretically possible.

### **"Too Dangerous" Threshold**

Because there are **no formal controlled toxicology studies**, there is *no established margin between dose and toxicity*, and **no toxic dose threshold**.

## ⚠️ Scientific and Regulatory Context

Peptide bioregulators like Glandokort were developed in Russian research by Vladimir Khavinson and colleagues; they are sometimes described in older Russian clinical literature but **are not standard pharmaceuticals approved with full pharmacologic characterization** in Western medicine. ([PubMed][8])

Thus, while supplement sellers and small clinical manuals *claim* beneficial actions, there is **no established pharmacokinetic or toxicology data** comparable to that of approved drugs.

---

## 📌 Final Notes

If you are considering using Glandokort or related peptides:

* Consult a qualified healthcare provider — especially if you are on other medications, pregnant, breastfeeding, or have health conditions.
* Be cautious about interpreting *supplement claims* as clinical evidence.
* Understand that broad safety margins or toxicology data do not exist in the scientific literature for this product.
