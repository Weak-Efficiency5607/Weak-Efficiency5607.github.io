Yes, Andrographis paniculata (commonly known as green chiretta or king of bitters) is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, and it has been extensively studied for its interactions with the immune system. Research indicates that extracts from the plant, particularly its active compound andrographolide, exhibit immunomodulatory effects, meaning they can regulate and enhance immune responses by influencing immune cells, cytokines, and other components of the immune system. For example, it has been shown to stimulate T lymphocytes, activate macrophages, suppress excessive proinflammatory cytokines, and promote overall immune function, which may help in reducing the severity of infections like the common cold or upper respiratory tract issues.

Regarding immunodeficiency (a condition involving weakened or impaired immune function), Andrographis paniculata has demonstrated potential benefits in preclinical studies. In animal models where immunosuppression was induced (e.g., using cyclophosphamide), leaf extracts of the plant helped restore immune parameters, such as improving white blood cell counts and enhancing antibody production, suggesting a protective or restorative role against induced immunodeficiency. Additionally, its antiviral properties have been explored in contexts like HIV (which causes acquired immunodeficiency), where it shows immunostimulant and anti-HIV activities by regulating host immunity and inhibiting viral factors. However, while these findings indicate a positive relationship, human clinical evidence is limited, and it may interact with immunosuppressive medications by counteracting their effects (e.g., in transplant patients), potentially leading to complications. Always consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially for immune-related conditions.
