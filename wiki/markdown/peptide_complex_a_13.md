The term **“Peptide complex A-13”** is **not a well-defined pharmacological drug** in the scientific or medical literature. What *is* commonly referred to in peer-reviewed pharmacology are **endogenous peptides with 13 amino acids**, notably:

1. **Apelin-13 (also called Pyr¹-apelin-13)** — a biologically active peptide fragment of the apelin family that activates the **APJ (apelin) G-protein-coupled receptor** and has cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroprotective actions. ([Wikipedia][1])
2. **Dynorphin A¹-13** — the 13-amino-acid form of the opioid peptide *dynorphin A*, active at **κ-opioid receptors (KOR)** with opioid-related pharmacology. ([Wikipedia][2])

Below is the most complete summary available of **pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics (half-life and bioavailability), and dosing information** for each — **with citations**. Note: *formal clinical dosing and bioavailability data for these peptides as drugs do not exist in humans outside research settings; most information is from animal or in-vitro studies.*

## 1) **Apelin-13 (Pyr¹-apelin-13)**

### Pharmacological Actions

**Receptor / Mechanism**

* Endogenous ligand for the **APJ receptor** (a Gαi-coupled GPCR). ([guidetopharmacology.org][3])
* Activation decreases cAMP, recruits β-arrestin, and triggers MAPK/ERK and Akt signaling. ([Frontiers][4])

**Major Actions**

* **Cardiovascular**

  * *Vasodilation*: decreases peripheral resistance via endothelium-dependent NO release. ([Wikipedia][1])
  * *Positive inotropy*: increases cardiac contractility in isolated heart models. ([MDPI][5])
  * *Blood pressure lowering* (hypotensive) in rodents. ([OUP Academic][6])

* **Metabolic & Other Effects**

  * Modulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (preclinical). ([Frontiers][7])
  * Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in CNS disease models, regulates apoptosis and autophagy. ([ScienceDirect][8])

**Temporal Pharmacodynamics**

* Onset of cardiovascular effects in rodents tends to occur within **minutes** of intravenous infusion, with the peak and duration limited by rapid degradation. ([benchchem.com][9])

### Pharmacokinetics

**Half-Life**

* Very **short systemic half-life** when administered exogenously:

  * **<3 minutes** in rat plasma after intravenous administration. ([benchchem.com][9])
  * Reported **~7–14 minutes** in isolated plasma assays depending on species and assay conditions. ([benchchem.com][9])

**Bioavailability**

* Not orally bioavailable in native form due to proteolytic degradation and first-pass metabolism (typical of peptides). ([benchchem.com][9])
* Parenteral (IV/SC) bioavailability is much higher than any oral uptake but varies with formulation; **no formal human bioavailability reported**.
* Some formulations (PEGylated/liposomal) in preclinical models dramatically increase systemic exposure compared with native peptide. ([benchchem.com][10])

### Dosing (Research Use Only)

There are **no approved therapeutic doses** of apelin-13 for humans. In animal research, doses are typically:

* **Cardiovascular studies** in rodents:

  * ~0.1–1.0 µg/kg IV produces hemodynamic effects. ([MDPI][5])
  * Some chronic models use ~10–300 nmol/kg per day via IP or SC. ([MDPI][5])

*Minimum Effective Dose* is model-dependent and not standardized in humans.

### Safety / Notes

* Not approved as a drug; dosing should only be interpreted in a research context.
* Rapid degradation by ACE2 and other peptidases limits duration of action. ([Frontiers][4])

## 2) **Dynorphin A¹-13**

> **Caveat:** Dynorphin A is a **natural opioid neuropeptide** with wide effects but **no approved clinical peptide drug form**. Dynorphin-based agents are mainly research tools.

### Pharmacological Actions

**Receptor / Mechanism**

* Full or partial agonist at **κ-opioid receptors (KOR)**, also interacts with μ and δ receptors in some settings. ([Wikipedia][11])

**Major Effects**

* **Analgesia / Pain modulation:** classic opioid mechanisms in rodents and some early human research. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Neuroendocrine effects:** modulates prolactin secretion in small human studies. ([PubMed][12])
* Possible regulation of mood and stress circuits via KOR modulation. ([Wikipedia][11])

**Temporal Action**

* Rapid onset with direct central or peripheral administration; duration depends on route and metabolism (typically short). Human detailed profiles not established.

### Pharmacokinetics

**Half-Life**

* Very short in plasma: **<1 minute** in human plasma ex-vivo due to rapid proteolysis. ([PubMed][13])
* More stable in cerebrospinal fluid in vitro (~2.5 h), but this does **not** reflect systemic kinetics. ([PubMed][14])

**Bioavailability**

* No established oral bioavailability — likely negligible in humans due to peptidase degradation.
* Experimental administration in humans has been via infusion or injection in research; no formal bioavailability values published.

### Dosing (Research)

* Early human research used **opioid-experienced volunteers** with loads sufficient to affect withdrawal or hormone levels (specific doses varying by study). ([PubMed][15])
* No approved clinical or safe dosing range in humans.

## General Pharmacological Patterns of Peptide Drugs

Because both apelin-13 and dynorphin A¹-13 are peptides:

* **Oral bioavailability is essentially zero** for native peptides (rapid GI degradation). ([benchchem.com][9])
* **Parenteral routes (IV, SC) are required** for systemic exposure. ([benchchem.com][9])
* Unmodified peptides have **very short half-lives** in circulation (minutes), unless chemically modified. ([benchchem.com][9])
* Modifications (PEGylation, lipidation) can *extend half-life* to hours in preclinical models. ([benchchem.com][10])
