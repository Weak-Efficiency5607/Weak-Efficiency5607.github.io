Yes, IFN-γ (interferon gamma) levels are typically elevated during chronic infections caused by intracellular pathogens, as it plays a key role in activating macrophages, enhancing antigen presentation, and promoting Th1-type immune responses to control the infection. This elevation is a common feature in many such infections, occurring in the majority of cases where the immune system mounts a cell-mediated response, but it is not universal—exceptions include scenarios with genetic defects, autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-γ, or immunosuppression where the response is impaired or suppressed, leading to more severe disease.

### Role and Elevation of IFN-γ in Chronic Infections
IFN-γ is produced primarily by activated T cells (CD4+ Th1 and CD8+), natural killer (NK) cells, and sometimes macrophages or dendritic cells in response to persistent antigens from intracellular pathogens. Its elevation helps orchestrate antimicrobial defenses, such as nitric oxide production and phagocyte activation, but prolonged high levels can contribute to inflammation, tissue damage, T cell exhaustion, and immunopathology.  

- **Bacterial Infections**: In chronic tuberculosis (TB) caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, IFN-γ levels are commonly elevated to activate macrophages and form granulomas, with studies showing high production in active disease; deficiencies lead to disseminated infection. Similarly, in chronic Q fever (*Coxiella burnetii*), high IFN-γ is observed during active infection, aiding control but potentially defective in progression. In leprosy (*Mycobacterium leprae*), elevated IFN-γ correlates with tuberculoid forms where the infection is contained. Elevation is very common in these cases, occurring in most immunocompetent individuals.

- **Viral Infections**: In chronic HIV, IFN-γ is often elevated, contributing to persistent inflammation and neurological damage like HIV-associated dementia, though it may wane in advanced immunosuppression. In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), mixed results show elevated IFN-γ in some populations, aiding viral control but not always sufficient for clearance. In Long COVID (post-SARS-CoV-2), persistently high IFN-γ is seen in many patients, linked to ongoing symptoms. Elevation is common but can be suppressed by type I IFNs or exhaustion.

- **Parasitic Infections**: In chronic toxoplasmosis (*Toxoplasma gondii*), IFN-γ is critically elevated to activate macrophages and prevent reactivation, with low levels causing severe disease. In leishmaniasis (*Leishmania major*), high IFN-γ promotes resistance, while low levels lead to visceral dissemination. Elevation is highly common in controlled chronic states.

### Commonality and Frequency
Elevated IFN-γ is very common in chronic intracellular pathogen infections, happening in the vast majority (e.g., >80% based on immunological studies) of cases requiring Th1 responses, as persistent antigens drive sustained production.  It does not occur "all the time"—exceptions include:
- Genetic defects (e.g., IFN-γ receptor deficiencies) or anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies, where effective levels are low, leading to severe opportunistic infections like nontuberculous mycobacteria.  
- Immunosuppressed states (e.g., advanced HIV or certain cancers), where production is impaired.
- Some viral infections where type I IFNs dominate and suppress IFN-γ.

In therapeutic contexts, like chronic granulomatous disease, exogenous IFN-γ is administered because natural levels are insufficient, reducing infection rates by ~67%.
