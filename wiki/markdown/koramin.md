I couldn’t find any **reliable official pharmacological data** (from regulatory agencies, peer-reviewed drug monographs or standard pharmacopeias) for a medicine called *Koramin* described as a “complex of proteins and nucleoproteins.” It appears that **what you are referring to as “Koramin” is not a recognized approved pharmaceutical in major databases**, but rather a *dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator* marketed (primarily in some Eastern-European/Russian-Federation supplement contexts) with claimed effects. ([e-peptide.com][1])

Below is everything that can be **factually ascertained**, clearly separating what is **established pharmacology** versus what is **unverified marketing claims**.

---

## 🧬 1. What *Koramin* (Peptide Bioregulator) Is

*Koramin* (also spelled *Coramin* in some sources) in the supplement context is described as:

* A **natural peptide bioregulator** — a complex of short peptides (proteins) and nucleoproteins extracted from **cardiac tissue of young animals**. ([e-peptide.com][1])
* Sold as a **dietary supplement**, not an approved pharmaceutical in European or US regulatory drug databases.
* Typically presented for **cardiovascular support** and **regeneration** in promotional materials.

> **Important:** There are *no standard pharmacopeial entries, regulatory labels (like FDA or EMA product monographs), or clinical pharmacokinetics studies* for this product. Any detailed pharmacological parameters in the literature are therefore *not established science*.

---

## ⚖️ 2. Claimed Pharmacological Actions — *Marketing / Supplement Claims*

According to supplement product descriptions:

### Primary Effects Claimed

These therapeutic effects are *claimed* but **not validated** in standard clinical pharmacology literature:

1. **Selective support of cardiac muscle cells** — targeting heart function. ([e-peptide.com][1])
2. **Improvement of myocardial resilience** to ischemia and stress (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1])
3. **Normalization of contractile function** of the heart. ([e-peptide.com][1])
4. **Reduction of angina frequency and duration** (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1])
5. **Support for recovery after myocardial infarction** and cardiac injury (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1])
6. **Improvement of exercise tolerance and energy use** in cardiac tissues (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1])

> ⚠️ These effects come from **marketing and supplement vendors** — they do *not represent established pharmacological actions recognized by regulatory drug authorities*. No validated mechanism of action, receptor targets, or clinical efficacy data are publicly documented in major scientific sources.

## 📉 3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters — **No Reliable Data**

There are **no verified pharmacokinetic studies** (such as blood level time-courses, half-life, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion) for *Koramin* as a specific product.

### What *would* be expected for peptide complexes

**General principles for orally administered peptides:**

* **Bioavailability:** Peptides taken orally are generally poorly bioavailable because:

  * They are degraded by digestive enzymes.
  * They are not specifically engineered for absorption like peptide drugs (e.g., insulin analogues). ([fr.iliveok.com][2])

* **Half-life:** Short peptides typically have very **short plasma half-lives** (minutes to low hours) unless chemically modified/protected — but *no data exist for Koramin itself*.

* **Distribution:** If absorbed, small peptides might circulate briefly then be broken down to amino acids — but again, **no data** exist.

**Conclusion on pharmacokinetics:**
👉 There is **no reliable half-life figure, bioavailability data (oral or otherwise), or published metabolism/elimination profile** for this product.

## 💊 4. Dosage Information — From Supplement Labels

Since *Koramin* is marketed as a supplement and not an approved drug, dosage ranges are based on vendor recommendations, not clinical trials:

### Typical Supplement Dosage

* **Form:** Capsule or tablet, ~155 mg (peptide/nucleoprotein complex). ([e-peptide.com][1])
* **Suggested dose:**

  * **1–3 capsules/tablets**, **2–3 times daily**,
  * **10–15 min before meals**,
  * **for 10–15 days per course**. ([e-peptide.com][1])
* **Repeat courses:** Often marketed for repetition after **3–6 months**. ([e-peptide.com][1])

⚠️ These recommendations are **not clinically validated dosing ranges**, and there is no **minimum effective dose** or **maximum safe dose** with established safety data in either healthy or disease populations.

---

## 📊 5. Safety and Side Effects — **Not Officially Studied**

There are **no systematic safety studies** published for this product. Therefore:

* **Adverse reactions** and **toxicity profiles** are *unknown*.
* **Interactions** with medications (e.g., cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants) are *unknown*.
* **Contraindications** and **special populations (pregnancy, kidney disease, etc.)** are *not established*.

Clinically approved products generally have extensive safety data; such data are *not available* for this product.

## ⚠️ Final Conclusion (Evidence-Based)

➡️ **Koramin (peptide bioregulator)** is *not recognized* in major pharmacological references as an approved drug.
➡️ **No scientifically validated pharmacological actions, half-life values, bioavailability, or dosage data** exist in peer-reviewed or regulatory sources.
➡️ All described actions and doses are from *supplement marketing claims*, not established pharmacology.
