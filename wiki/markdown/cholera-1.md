Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection with the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*. **Most people** infected (75–90% or more) have **no symptoms** or only mild diarrhea that resolves on its own and is hard to distinguish from other causes of gastroenteritis. Only a minority develop recognizable cholera illness, and of those who do, 80–90% have mild-to-moderate symptoms while 10–20% (roughly 1 in 10 infected people overall) progress to **severe disease** with life-threatening dehydration.

The percentages below refer to how commonly each symptom appears in **symptomatic cholera cases** (people with clinically apparent illness, not asymptomatic carriers). Exact per-symptom percentages are rarely stated in major guidelines because the disease is defined by its hallmark diarrhea, but prevalence can be estimated from clinical descriptions across CDC, WHO, Mayo Clinic, and peer-reviewed sources.

### Core Gastrointestinal Symptoms (Present in Nearly All Symptomatic Cases)
- **Profuse watery diarrhea** (“rice-water stool” — pale, milky, mucus-flecked, sometimes fishy-smelling)  
  Present in **~100%** of symptomatic patients. This is the defining symptom; cholera illness is essentially diagnosed by acute watery diarrhea + dehydration risk in an endemic/outbreak setting.

- **Nausea and vomiting**  
  Very common — present in the **majority** (typically 70–90% of symptomatic cases, especially early on). Vomiting often accompanies or even precedes diarrhea and can last for hours.

### Symptoms Related to Electrolyte Loss and Dehydration
These become more prominent with increasing severity and fluid loss:

- **Leg or muscle cramps** (from rapid loss of sodium, chloride, potassium)  
  Common, especially in moderate-to-severe cases — present in **~50–80%** of patients who reach medical care (listed as a classic early/severe symptom by CDC).

- **Excessive thirst**  
  Very common — appears early (at 3–5% body weight fluid loss) in **most patients** who lose significant volume.

- **Dry mouth / dry mucous membranes**  
  Common in moderate dehydration (5–8% fluid loss) — seen in **most patients** with noticeable dehydration.

- **Weakness, fatigue, restlessness or irritability**  
  Common once dehydration sets in — present in **most moderate-to-severe cases**.

- **Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)** and **low blood pressure** (including postural drop)  
  Common in moderate dehydration and almost universal in severe cases.

- **Sunken eyes, decreased skin elasticity** (“washerwoman” or “wrinkled” skin), reduced urine output  
  Typical of severe dehydration (>10% body weight loss) — present in **most severe cases** (the 10–20% of symptomatic patients who become gravely ill).

- **Shock, coma, or death** (if untreated)  
  Occurs in untreated severe cases — mortality can reach 50–70% without rehydration, but drops to <1% with proper treatment.

In summary, virtually every symptomatic cholera patient has watery diarrhea, most have vomiting, and the remaining symptoms scale with how much fluid and electrolytes are lost. Mild cases may only have diarrhea ± vomiting, while severe “cholera gravis” includes the full spectrum of dehydration signs. Rapid rehydration (oral or IV) is life-saving and prevents the more dangerous symptoms from developing.
