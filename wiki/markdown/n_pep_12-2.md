N-PEP-12 is a proprietary dietary supplement composed of a mixture of neuropeptides and amino acids derived through the enzymatic hydrolysis of purified porcine (pig) brain proteins. It is an oral derivative of Cerebrolysin, a similar brain-derived peptide preparation, but formulated for enhanced bioavailability and oral administration. The exact formulation is patented and not fully disclosed in detail, but it is designed to mimic the effects of natural neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor, to support neuronal protection and cognitive function. Commercial products containing N-PEP-12 (e.g., MemoProve or Cebrium) typically include 90 mg of the active compound per dose, along with excipients such as lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, and coating agents like cellulose acetate phthalate or titanium dioxide.
