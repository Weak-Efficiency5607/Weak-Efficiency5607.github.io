### Key Points
- Ivermectin tablets can likely be stored in the fridge for up to 36 months, the same as at room temperature, though research suggests refrigeration may help preserve them longer.
- It seems likely that refrigeration is not necessary but is acceptable, as long as temperatures do not drop below freezing, which could damage the tablets.
- The evidence leans toward storing Ivermectin below 30°C (86°F), and since fridge temperatures (around 4°C) fit within this range, it should be safe.

### Storage Guidelines
Ivermectin, known as MK-933 and commonly sold as Stromectol, is used to treat parasitic infections. Official guidelines suggest storing it at room temperature, below 30°C (86°F), protected from light, with a shelf life of 36 months. While refrigeration is not required, it appears safe to store in the fridge, potentially extending shelf life, though specific data on this is limited. Ensure the fridge temperature does not freeze the tablets, as freezing could compromise their integrity.

### Additional Considerations
Always check the product label for specific instructions, as formulations may vary. If in doubt, consult a pharmacist or healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Ivermectin (MK-933) Storage in the Fridge

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the storage conditions for Ivermectin tablets, specifically addressing the duration they can be stored in a refrigerator. The analysis is based on a thorough review of pharmacological guidelines, manufacturer information, and user discussions, ensuring a detailed understanding for both laypersons and professionals.

#### Background on Ivermectin
Ivermectin, identified by the code MK-933 and marketed under brand names like Stromectol, is an antiparasitic medication used to treat infections such as strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. It is available in various forms, including tablets, creams, and lotions, but this analysis focuses on the oral tablet form due to the user's query.

#### Standard Storage Conditions
Official sources, including the package insert from Merck and the electronic Medicines Compendium (emc) for the UK, specify that Ivermectin tablets should be stored at temperatures below 30°C (86°F). The emc further notes no special temperature storage conditions are required, with a shelf life of 36 months for both blister and bottle packaging, provided the tablets are protected from light and kept in their original packaging. WebMD and Drugs.com corroborate this, emphasizing storage at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

- **Temperature Range**: Below 30°C (86°F), typically room temperature.
- **Light Protection**: Store in original packaging to shield from light.
- **Shelf Life**: 36 months from the date of manufacture under standard conditions.

#### Refrigeration: Is It Necessary or Beneficial?
While refrigeration is not mandated, several sources suggest it is acceptable and may even be beneficial. The Pace Hospital website explicitly states, "Ivermectin does not need refrigeration, as it can be safely stored at room temperature. Nevertheless, it does stay good in the refrigerator or in colder temperatures." User forums, such as the gun dog forum and The Goat Spot Forum, also discuss storing Ivermectin (including injectable forms like Ivomec) in the fridge, with manufacturers confirming it's okay as long as temperatures do not drop below freezing. An Amazon user mentioned keeping Ivermectin paste in the refrigerator to extend its shelf life, suggesting a common practice among users.

Refrigeration, typically at around 4°C (39°F), falls well within the recommended temperature range below 30°C, suggesting no adverse effects. In pharmaceutical science, lower temperatures often slow degradation processes, potentially extending shelf life, though specific studies for Ivermectin tablets under refrigerated conditions are not widely documented in the reviewed sources.

#### Duration of Storage in the Fridge
The standard shelf life of 36 months is established for storage at room temperature. Given that refrigeration is within the acceptable temperature range and may preserve the medication better, it is reasonable to conclude that Ivermectin tablets can be stored in the fridge for at least 36 months. However, there is no explicit data confirming an extended shelf life beyond this period under refrigerated conditions. For instance, a study on drug expiry from PMC notes that solid dosage forms like tablets are generally stable past their expiration date, and lower temperatures could enhance stability, but this is not specific to Ivermectin.

To provide a conservative estimate, the shelf life in the fridge is likely at least 36 months, with the possibility of longer preservation, though this cannot be confirmed without further research. Users should always check the expiration date on the packaging and consult healthcare providers if unsure.

#### Risks and Precautions
While refrigeration appears safe, care must be taken to avoid freezing, as temperatures below 0°C (32°F) could damage the tablets, potentially affecting their efficacy. Sources like the gun dog forum and CattleToday.com emphasize avoiding extreme temperatures, and the FDA label reinforces storage below 30°C without mentioning freezing as a concern, but common sense suggests avoiding it.

Additionally, ensure the refrigerator environment is dry and protected from light, as moisture and light exposure can degrade medications. Always store in the original packaging to maintain integrity.

#### Comparative Analysis of Storage Conditions
The following table summarizes the key storage conditions and shelf life based on reviewed sources:

| **Condition**         | **Temperature**       | **Light Protection** | **Shelf Life** | **Notes**                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Room Temperature      | Below 30°C (86°F)     | Yes, protect from light | 36 months      | Standard recommendation, no refrigeration needed |
| Refrigerated          | Around 4°C (39°F)     | Yes, protect from light | At least 36 months, possibly longer | Acceptable, avoid freezing (below 0°C) |

#### Practical Implications for Users
For individuals storing Ivermectin in the fridge, it is advisable to:
- Ensure the refrigerator maintains a consistent temperature above freezing.
- Keep the tablets in their original blister or bottle to protect from light and moisture.
- Check the expiration date, typically printed on the packaging, and discard after 36 months unless otherwise advised by a pharmacist.
- If the medication shows signs of discoloration, unusual odor, or physical damage, consult a healthcare provider before use.

#### Conclusion
Ivermectin (MK-933) tablets can be stored in the fridge for up to 36 months, aligning with the standard shelf life at room temperature, and possibly longer due to the preservative effects of lower temperatures. While not required, refrigeration is a safe and potentially beneficial option, provided temperatures do not drop below freezing. Users should always refer to the product label and seek professional advice for specific storage concerns.
