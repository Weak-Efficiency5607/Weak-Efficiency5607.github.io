Vortioxetine (Brintellix/Trintellix) -- Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosage
===============================================================================

Pharmacological Actions (Mechanism of Action)
---------------------------------------------

Vortioxetine is a **multimodal serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS)**. It strongly inhibits the serotonin transporter (SERT) (Ki≈1.6 nM; IC₅₀≈5.4 nM), greatly increasing synaptic 5-HT. It also directly modulates several 5-HT receptors:

-   **5-HT₃ antagonist:** Ki≈3.7 nM. This blockade may reduce GI side effects and nausea and contribute to vortioxetine's antidepressant effect.

-   **5-HT₁A agonist:** Ki≈15 nM. Agonism at 5-HT₁A (an autoreceptor and postsynaptic receptor) can enhance serotonergic neurotransmission.

-   **5-HT₁B partial agonist:** Ki≈33 nM. Partial agonism at 5-HT₁B may modulate serotonin release.

-   **5-HT₁D antagonist:** Ki≈54 nM. Blocking 5-HT₁D (an autoreceptor) may prevent negative feedback inhibition of 5-HT release.

-   **5-HT₇ antagonist:** Ki≈19 nM. Antagonism at 5-HT₇ has been linked to pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects.

At higher (weak) affinity, vortioxetine has negligible activity at other monoamine transporters: NET Ki≈113 nM and DAT Ki>1000 nM, so it is not considered an SNRI or NDRI. (Some reports list minor β₁-adrenergic or NET binding, but these are weak and clinically insignificant.) All these pharmacologic effects occur with the same drug concentration after dosing; in practice, vortioxetine's antidepressant action is thought to arise from the combined SERT blockade plus receptor modulation.

Pharmacokinetics
----------------

-   **Absorption and Bioavailability:** Vortioxetine is **well absorbed orally** with an absolute bioavailability of about **75%**. Food does not appreciably affect its absorption. After an oral dose, plasma levels rise slowly: **Tmax** (time to peak concentration) is typically **7--11 hours**.

-   **Distribution:** The apparent volume of distribution is very large (~**2500--3400 L**), indicating extensive tissue uptake. Vortioxetine is highly protein-bound in plasma (about **98--99%**), leaving ~1--2% free drug.

-   **Metabolism:** Vortioxetine is **extensively metabolized** in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway is oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially **CYP2D6**, with contributions from CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP2C8) followed by glucuronidation. No major active metabolites contribute significantly to its pharmacologic effect. Vortioxetine itself does not induce or inhibit P450 enzymes at therapeutic levels, minimizing drug-drug interactions.

-   **Elimination Half-Life:** The **terminal half-life** is approximately **66 hours** (mean; range ~59--69 h). This long half-life means vortioxetine accumulates with chronic dosing: steady-state is reached in about **2 weeks** (≈12 days for 90% of steady-state). The accumulation ratio (steady-state AUC vs. single-dose AUC) is about **5--6**. Vortioxetine pharmacokinetics are linear and dose-proportional from ~2.5 to 75 mg (single dose) and up to 60 mg (multiple doses).

-   **Elimination:** Clearance is mainly hepatic. An estimated **30--41 L/h** of total clearance has been reported. Over 85% of the drug is recovered in 15 days after a radiolabeled dose (59% in urine, 26% in feces). Less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Because clearance depends heavily on CYP2D6, poor metabolizers have about **twice** the exposure of extensive metabolizers (and may require dose reduction).

Therapeutic Dosing
------------------

-   **Indication:** Major Depressive Disorder in adults.

-   **Typical Dose Range:** The usual starting dose is **10 mg once daily**, taken orally. Depending on response and tolerability, the dose may be **increased to 20 mg once daily**. A 5 mg tablet is available for titration (e.g. starting at 5 mg in highly sensitive patients, then up to 10--20 mg). In clinical trials, doses of **5--20 mg/day** were used; 10 mg is generally considered the minimum effective dose. (The manufacturer notes that doses above 20 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated.)

-   **Dose Adjustments:** For known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, a **maximum of 10 mg/day** is recommended due to higher exposure. Dose may be halved when coadministered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) and increased (up to threefold the prior dose) with strong inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine).

-   **Safety:** In therapeutic trials (≤20 mg/day), vortioxetine was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, and sexual side effects (incidence ~4--6% at 20 mg, similar to SSRIs). Because of SERT inhibition, standard SSRI warnings apply (e.g. risk of serotonin syndrome, bleeding when combined with NSAIDs, and suicidality in youth).

Overdose and Toxicity
---------------------

-   **Acute LD50 (Animal):** In rodents, the oral LD50 of vortioxetine hydrobromide is relatively high: ~**300 mg/kg** in mice and **500 mg/kg** in rats. (Note: the base weight would be lower by ~20% on a molar basis.) These values indicate a large safety margin relative to human therapeutic doses.

-   **Human Overdose Reports:** Published case reports suggest vortioxetine is **relatively non-toxic in overdose**. For example, one report describes a 50-year-old man who ingested 250 mg (≈12× the 20 mg dose) and had *no significant clinical effects*. Another case involved a teenager who took 300 mg (30× a 10 mg dose); she experienced vomiting, abdominal pain and mild drowsiness but remained hemodynamically stable with no serotonin syndrome, and recovered with supportive care. These experiences suggest that even very large overdoses tend to produce only mild to moderate symptoms (mainly GI upset, dizziness, sedation) rather than life-threatening toxicity.

-   **"Too Dangerous" Threshold:** No specific human LD50 is established. The data imply that toxicity rises gradually well above therapeutic levels. Clinical trials tested single doses up to ~75 mg without serious harm, observing dose-dependent nausea and somnolence. Nonetheless, dosing above 20 mg/day is not recommended because safety beyond that is unproven. As with other SSRIs/SNRIs, serious toxicity (seizures, significant ECG changes) is more associated with multi-drug overdose; pure vortioxetine overdose cases have not shown fatal outcomes. In any overdose, standard supportive measures (gastric lavage/charcoal if early, cardiac monitoring) should be instituted.

Pharmacokinetic Values Summary
------------------------------

-   **Bioavailability (oral):** ≈75%. (No intravenous or other formulations are marketed; intravenous formulation has been used experimentally to "load" vortioxetine, achieving steady-state faster.)

-   **Tmax:** 7--11 hours post-dose.

-   **Half-life:** ~66 hours (59--69 h).

-   **Distribution:** Vd ~2600 L; protein binding ~98--99%.

-   **Clearance:** ~30--41 L/h.

-   **Metabolism:** Mainly hepatic (CYP2D6, others). <1% unchanged drug in urine.

-   **Dosing:** 5--20 mg/day; starting at 10 mg/day; max 20 mg/day (10 mg/day for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers).

-   **LD50 (animals):** ~300 mg/kg (mouse), 500 mg/kg (rat).

-   **Overdose:** Human reports of 12--30× therapeutic dose (250--300 mg) caused only mild symptoms.

These data indicate that vortioxetine has a long duration of action (due to long half-life), high oral bioavailability, and a wide margin of safety relative to its therapeutic dose. Dosing should follow guidelines (≤20 mg/day), and any overdose should be managed supportively.
