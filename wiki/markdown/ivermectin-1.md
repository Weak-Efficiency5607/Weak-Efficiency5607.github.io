### Key Points
- Research suggests anhedonia is not a commonly recognized side effect of ivermectin at standard doses.
- There are reports of psychiatric side effects like psychosis with high-dose ivermectin, but anhedonia specifically is not well-documented.
- The evidence leans toward minimal risk of anhedonia from ivermectin, though rare cases cannot be entirely ruled out.

### Overview
Ivermectin is a medication primarily used to treat parasitic infections, and while it has various side effects, anhedonia—the inability to feel pleasure from activities—is not typically associated with its use at standard doses. However, understanding the potential risks, especially in rare or high-dose scenarios, is important for informed decision-making.

### Side Effects and Anhedonia
Standard medical sources, such as WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and Drugs.com, do not list anhedonia as a side effect of ivermectin. While some user-reported databases like eHealthMe mention anhedonia in the 20-29 age group, there is no detailed evidence or frequency data to support this as a common risk. High-dose or off-label use, particularly for conditions like COVID-19, has been linked to severe psychiatric side effects like psychosis, but anhedonia is not specifically noted in these cases.

### Conclusion
Given the current evidence, the risk of developing anhedonia from ivermectin intake appears low, especially at recommended doses. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Anhedonia Risks with Ivermectin Intake

This note provides a comprehensive examination of the potential risks of anhedonia associated with ivermectin intake, based on a thorough review of medical literature and databases as of July 16, 2025. The analysis aims to address the query by synthesizing information from various sources, ensuring a detailed and professional presentation suitable for a lay audience seeking clarity on this topic.

#### Introduction
Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication, widely recognized for treating conditions such as river blindness (onchocerciasis) and strongyloidiasis, and is listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Approved for human use since 1987, it has a well-established safety profile at standard doses. However, the query focuses on the potential risk of anhedonia, a condition characterized by the inability to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable, often linked to depression or other psychiatric disorders. This analysis explores whether ivermectin intake poses such a risk, considering both standard and high-dose scenarios.

#### Methodology
The investigation involved searching medical databases and authoritative health websites, including WebMD, Mayo Clinic, Drugs.com, and PubMed, using queries such as "anhedonia side effect of ivermectin," "ivermectin psychiatric side effects," and "ivermectin depression side effect." Additionally, user-reported side effect databases like eHealthMe were reviewed for anecdotal evidence. The analysis prioritized peer-reviewed articles and case reports to ensure reliability, with a focus on information relevant as of the current date, 04:41 PM CEST on July 16, 2025.

#### Findings

##### General Side Effects of Ivermectin
Ivermectin's side effects at standard doses, as documented by sources like WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and Drugs.com, include common issues such as diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and swelling, with rare serious effects like neurological problems, severe skin reactions, and liver damage. None of these sources explicitly list anhedonia or depression as side effects. For instance:
- WebMD notes common side effects like itching and rash but does not mention anhedonia.
- Mayo Clinic and Drugs.com similarly focus on gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurological side effects, with no reference to mood-related issues like anhedonia.

Wikipedia also highlights that side effects are uncommon at standard doses, with serious adverse events more common in cases of high larval Loa loa burdens, but again, anhedonia is not mentioned.

##### User-Reported Data and Anecdotal Evidence
One notable finding came from eHealthMe, a database of user-reported side effects, which mentioned anhedonia as a reported side effect for the age group 20-29. However, this report lacked specific frequency data or peer-reviewed validation, making it difficult to assess causality or prevalence. The entry was brief, stating:
| Age Group | Side Effect Reported                     | Notes                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 20-29     | Anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable) | Mentioned, no frequency data |

This suggests that while some individuals may report anhedonia, it is not supported by robust clinical evidence and may reflect individual variability rather than a direct drug effect.

##### Psychiatric Side Effects and High-Dose Use
The analysis revealed several case reports and studies linking ivermectin, particularly at high doses, to psychiatric side effects. For example:
- A PubMed article titled "Ivermectin-Induced Acute Psychosis in Patients Infected With COVID-19 Pneumonia" (PMC9210147) detailed two cases of acute psychosis in patients who received high-dose ivermectin for COVID-19, presenting with auditory hallucinations and delusional behavior. However, anhedonia was not mentioned in these reports.
- Another PubMed article, "Increased risk of psychosis to ivermectin treatment" (PMC9568042), discussed a 14-year-old female who developed psychosis after 2 weeks of ivermectin 6mg for pediculosis, with symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, isolation, abulia, and apathy. While apathy could theoretically overlap with anhedonia, it was not explicitly stated, and the focus was on psychotic symptoms.

An article from Internet and Psychiatry (published September 29, 2021) noted that ivermectin, especially at high doses, can cause adverse psychiatric problems such as sedation, confusion, coma, and seizures, due to potential blood-brain barrier penetration. This was linked to overdosing, pharmaceutical interactions, and hereditary factors, but anhedonia was not listed among these effects.

##### Mechanisms and Theoretical Risks
Ivermectin's mechanism of action involves binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in parasites, leading to paralysis and death. In humans, at therapeutic doses, it typically does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing central nervous system effects. However, in cases of overdose or in individuals with genetic mutations (e.g., ABCB1 gene variants), it can affect the central nervous system, potentially leading to neurological and psychiatric disturbances. Given that anhedonia is often associated with dopamine or other neurotransmitter imbalances, it is theoretically possible that such disturbances could include anhedonia, but this is speculative and not supported by direct evidence.

##### Comparison with Standard Literature
Standard medical literature, such as Healthline and Medical News Today, lists side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, and serious neurological issues, but neither mentions depression or anhedonia. For example, Healthline's article updated on July 10, 2025, includes common side effects like diarrhea and nausea, with serious effects like seizures and coma in overdose scenarios, but no mood-related side effects.

##### Discussion
The evidence suggests that anhedonia is not a recognized side effect of ivermectin at standard therapeutic doses, as supported by major health authorities and medical databases. The mention in eHealthMe is anecdotal and lacks sufficient detail to establish a causal link. While high-dose or off-label use has been associated with severe psychiatric side effects like psychosis, anhedonia specifically is not documented in these contexts. This aligns with the understanding that ivermectin's effects on the central nervous system are minimal at recommended doses, reducing the likelihood of mood-related side effects like anhedonia.

However, given the reports of psychiatric disturbances in high-dose scenarios, it cannot be entirely ruled out that rare cases might include symptoms overlapping with anhedonia, particularly in vulnerable populations or with misuse. This is particularly relevant given the controversy surrounding ivermectin's off-label use for COVID-19, where high doses have led to increased reports of adverse effects to poison control centers, as noted in a New England Journal of Medicine article from October 20, 2021.

#### Conclusion
Based on the current evidence, the risk of anhedonia from ivermectin intake is minimal at standard doses, with no established link in medical literature. While psychiatric side effects are possible with high-dose use, anhedonia is not specifically reported. Users are advised to consult healthcare providers for personalized advice, especially if considering off-label use or experiencing unusual symptoms.
