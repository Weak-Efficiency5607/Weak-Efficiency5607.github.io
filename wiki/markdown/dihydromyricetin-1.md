### Pharmacological Actions of Dihydromyricetin (DHM, Ampelopsin) Related to Chronic Pathogen Infections and Immunodeficiency

Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavanonol flavonoid, exhibits several pharmacological actions relevant to chronic pathogen infections (e.g., viral persistence leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and organ damage) and immunodeficiency (e.g., immune suppression, thymic atrophy). These include direct antiviral effects against chronic or persistent viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, HIV, influenza, pseudorabies virus [PRV], African swine fever virus [ASFV]), modulation of inflammatory pathways to mitigate infection-associated damage, and enhancement of immune function to counter immunodeficiency. No direct evidence links DHM to broad-spectrum immunodeficiency syndromes like AIDS, but it shows promise in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced immunosuppression models, which mimic chronic steroid use in infectious diseases.

Below, I summarize **all identified actions**, grouped by category, with mechanisms, specific pathogens/contexts, and quantitative values (e.g., IC50 for inhibition, doses/concentrations tested, time dependencies for onset/effect duration). Values are drawn from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies; where multiple exist, I provide the range or most relevant. "Time" refers to onset, duration, or dependency (e.g., hours post-infection [hpi] for antiviral effects). Human data is limited; most are preclinical.

#### 1. Direct Antiviral Effects (Relevant to Chronic Viral Infections)
DHM inhibits viral entry, replication, and protease activity, reducing viral load in persistent infections like hepatitis, HIV, or COVID-19 sequelae.

#### Key Notes on Quantitative Values and Influences
- **IC50 Ranges**: 1-161 μM across antivirals (lowest for SARS-CoV-2 entry ~1 μM; highest for PRV replication 161 μM). Influences: Lower IC50 indicates stronger potency; e.g., 1.14 μM for SARS-CoV-2 suggests clinical potential at low doses.
- **Doses**: In vitro: 15-1000 μM; In vivo: 50-250 mg/kg (mice/rats; human equivalent ~400-2000 mg/day based on scaling). Safe up to 1.6 g/kg (mice) or 10 g/kg (rats). Influences: Higher doses (>500 μM in vitro) maximize inhibition but risk cytotoxicity (CC50 ~900 μM).
- **Time Dependencies**: Most effects onset 6-24 hpi for antivirals (late replication phase); immunomodulation 3-7 days for structural repair (e.g., thymus). Influences: Early administration (pre- or peri-infection) prevents chronicity; delayed (24+ h) limits to damage control.
- **Limitations**: Few human trials; values from rodent/cell models. No data on bacterial/fungal chronic infections or primary immunodeficiencies. More values could emerge from ongoing derivative studies (e.g., Se-DHM IC50 0.017 mg/mL for related enzymes).

These actions position DHM as a multi-target adjunct for chronic infections, enhancing viral clearance while bolstering immunity. Consult clinical data for use.
