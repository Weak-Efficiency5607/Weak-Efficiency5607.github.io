### Pharmacological Actions of Cyclazodone
Cyclazodone (CAS 14461-91-7), also known as cyclopropylpemoline, is an obscure centrally acting stimulant developed in the 1960s by American Cyanamid Company and Les Laboratoires Dausse. It is structurally related to pemoline (a former ADHD treatment withdrawn due to hepatotoxicity) and thozalinone, but with a cyclopropyl group on the nitrogen. It was patented as a CNS stimulant and anorectic agent (GB 1005738, 1965) but never approved for medical use by the FDA or other regulators. As such, human data is extremely limited, derived mostly from animal studies, patents, and anecdotal user reports. No clinical trials exist, and much information is extrapolated from related compounds like pemoline and amphetamines.

Cyclazodone's primary pharmacological actions are as a **CNS stimulant**, **anorexigenic (appetite suppressant)**, and **antidepressant (in animal models)**. It exhibits efficacy and potency at least equal to d-amphetamine in animal tests for stimulation and antidepressant effects, with a favorable therapeutic index (ratio of effective dose to toxic dose) compared to pemoline. It shows lower cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity than d-amphetamine in mice. Subjective effects in humans (from limited reports) include focus enhancement, motivation boost, mild euphoria, increased stamina, and appetite suppression, resembling a mix of methylphenidate and modafinil but with softer physical stimulation than methamphetamine.

#### Mechanism of Action
- **Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) Agonism**: Acts as an amphetamine-like agonist at TAAR1, promoting the release of monoamines (dopamine [DA], norepinephrine [NE], and to a lesser extent serotonin [5-HT]) into the synaptic cleft. This leads to cognitive and physical stimulation.
- **Dopaminergic Action**: Primarily dopaminergic with minimal affinity for NE receptors, resulting in fewer sympathomimetic (e.g., cardiovascular) side effects than typical stimulants like methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine.
- **Potency Relative to Comparators**: 3-5x more potent than pemoline as an N-cyclopropyl derivative. In animal models, it matches or exceeds d-amphetamine in stimulant and antidepressant potency while being less toxic.
- No specific quantitative values (e.g., Ki binding affinities, IC50 for reuptake inhibition) are available due to lack of modern studies. Effects are inferred from structural analogs and patents.

No data on how these actions influence over time (e.g., time-course curves), but total duration of effects is 5-7 hours, with onset in 20-45 minutes (oral route). Peak effects likely occur 1-2 hours post-dose, tapering gradually.

### Pharmacokinetics
Data is sparse; no human pharmacokinetic studies exist. Extrapolations are from animal data and user reports.
- **Half-Life**: Unknown. Based on reported duration of effects (5-7 hours), elimination half-life is estimated at 2-4 hours (typical for short-acting stimulants like pemoline, which has a half-life of ~12 hours but shorter active effects).
- **Bioavailability**:
  - **Oral**: Unknown quantitatively, but oral is the primary route of administration with good presumed absorption based on efficacy in animal oral dosing studies. No absolute bioavailability percentage reported.
  - No data on other routes (e.g., intravenous, nasal, sublingual). It is not typically used non-orally, and patents focus on oral formulations.
- **Metabolism and Excretion**: Likely hepatic metabolism (similar to pemoline, via cytochrome P450 enzymes), with potential for hepatotoxicity at high/chronic doses. Excretion is presumably renal, but no specifics available.
- **Other Parameters**: No data on volume of distribution, clearance, or protein binding.

### Dosages and Safety Considerations
Dosages are based on anecdotal reports (e.g., from PsychonautWiki and user forums) and patents, as no official guidelines exist. Cyclazodone is unscheduled in most jurisdictions but sold as a research chemical. Use is experimental and risky due to limited safety data. It may cause tolerance with repeated use, cross-tolerance with other dopaminergic stimulants, and potential addiction at high recreational doses (though lower dependence potential than amphetamines, similar to pemoline).

| Dosage Category | Oral Dose (mg) | Description/Effects |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Threshold      | 5            | Minimum detectable effects (e.g., subtle focus/motivation boost). |
| Light          | 5-15         | Mild stimulation, appetite suppression; low risk for most users. |
| Common         | 15-25        | Standard effective range for nootropic/stimulant effects; balanced euphoria and focus. |
| Strong         | 25-60        | Intense stimulation, potential for anxiety/paranoia; increased side effects. |
| Heavy          | 60+          | High risk of adverse effects; not recommended. |

- **Safe Range**: 5-25 mg (light to common), based on user reports where effects are therapeutic-like without severe side effects. Start low due to individual variability.
- **Minimum Effective Dose**: 5 mg (threshold for noticeable effects).
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: Up to 25-60 mg (upper common to strong), but risks escalate above 25 mg (e.g., increased heart rate, anxiety, potential neurotoxicity from oxidative stress). Chronic use at any dose risks hepatotoxicity.
- **When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous**: Above 60 mg (heavy doses) or with frequent use (>2-3 times/week). Signs include severe anxiety, paranoia, dehydration, teeth grinding, elevated heart rate (>100 bpm), or nausea. Long-term: Liver damage speculated (like pemoline, which caused hepatotoxicity in children at therapeutic doses). High doses may induce indirect neurotoxicity via monoamine overload. No human overdose cases reported, but analogs like N-methylcyclazodone have caused choreoathetosis (involuntary movements) and rhabdomyolysis.
- **LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%)**:
  - Oral (mouse): 80 mg/kg
  - Intraperitoneal (mouse): 81 mg/kg
  - Subcutaneous (mouse): 142 mg/kg
  - No human LD50 available. Using human equivalent dose (HED) scaling from mouse (divide by ~12.3), oral LD50 estimate: ~6.5 mg/kg (e.g., ~455 mg for a 70 kg adult). This is a rough approximation and not reliable for humans—treat as indicative of moderate acute toxicity.
- **Toxicity Classification**: GHS Category 3 (Acute Toxicity, Oral: Toxic if swallowed). Low toxicity relative to activity in animals (favorable margin of safety vs. pemoline/amphetamine), but potential for hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity at high doses. No reported human fatalities, but avoid in those with liver/heart conditions.

For all values, the lack of clinical data means these are estimates. Consult sources like patents (e.g., GB 1005738) for animal data. If using, monitor liver enzymes and avoid combining with other stimulants or MAOIs.
