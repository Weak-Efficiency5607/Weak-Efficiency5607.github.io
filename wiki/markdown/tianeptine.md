The **time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax)** for **tianeptine sulfate** in the human body is generally longer than that of **tianeptine sodium** due to its slower absorption rate.

### **Tianeptine Sulfate Tmax:**

* Typically ranges between **3 to 6 hours** after oral administration.
* The sulfate form is designed for a **slower release**, leading to more stable plasma levels compared to the sodium form (which has a Tmax of around 1 hour).

This extended Tmax allows for less frequent dosing (often once daily), with reduced peaks and troughs in plasma concentration, potentially lowering side effects and the risk of abuse.

### ⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

* **Individual Variability:** Factors such as age, liver function, metabolic rate, and concurrent medications can affect absorption and metabolism.
* **Off-label Status:** Tianeptine sulfate is not widely approved for medical use in many countries and is sometimes available as a research chemical. Its use should always be under medical supervision.
