Yes, the provided structure matches one of the compounds listed in U.S. Patent 3,870,715 (granted in 1975 to Nikolaus R. Hansl, the same inventor associated with PRL-8-53), specifically the ethyl ester analog in the series of substituted amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters. While the exact structure of PRL-8-147 remains undisclosed in public sources and is described as a more potent, unreleased variant of PRL-8-53, it is plausible that PRL-8-147 refers to this ethyl ester variant, given the shared patent origin and structural similarity to PRL-8-53 (which is the methyl ester).
