N-PEP-12 is a proprietary dietary supplement developed as a cognitive enhancer and neuroprotective agent. It consists of a blend of neuropeptides and amino acids, produced through the enzymatic hydrolysis of purified nerve cell proteins, typically derived from porcine (pig) brain sources. This process adheres to pharmaceutical standards like GMP, resulting in small-chain peptides that mimic natural neurotrophic factors to support neuronal protection, regeneration, and cognitive function. It is often described as an oral analog or derivative of Cerebrolysin, an injectable peptide mixture from pig brain that may include neurotrophic components such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).

No exact molecular formula or exhaustive list of specific peptides is publicly available, as the precise composition is patented and proprietary. Commercial products like MemoProve contain 425 mg of N-PEP-12 per tablet as the primary active ingredient, with no additional excipients or allergens commonly noted (e.g., free from dairy, artificial colors, preservatives, psychostimulants, yeast, or sugar). For comparison, the related Cerebrolysin concentrate is standardized at 215.2 mg/ml in aqueous solution, with excipients limited to sodium hydroxide and water for injection.
