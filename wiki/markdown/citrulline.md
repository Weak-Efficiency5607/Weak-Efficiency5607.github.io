### Pharmacological Actions of L-Citrulline
L-Citrulline is a non-essential amino acid that primarily acts as a precursor to L-arginine, which in turn boosts nitric oxide (NO) production via nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This leads to many of its effects, including vasodilation and improved blood flow. It also supports the urea cycle for ammonia detoxification. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions based on available data from clinical, preclinical, and mechanistic studies. I've included as many quantitative values as possible for parameters like effect magnitude, timing (e.g., time to onset, peak effect, or duration where available), and how each action is influenced (e.g., mechanisms, dose-dependency, or contextual factors). Data is drawn from human trials, animal models, and in vitro studies; note that timings can vary by dose, formulation, and individual factors (e.g., health status). Where no specific timing is reported, it's often because effects are chronic (e.g., over days/weeks) rather than acute.

1. **Increases Nitric Oxide (NO) Production and Vasodilation**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: Converted to L-arginine in the kidneys (80% conversion rate), which serves as a substrate for NOS to produce NO. NO relaxes vascular smooth muscle, improving endothelial function and blood flow. Inhibits arginase (by 21% in type 2 diabetes models), preserving more arginine for NO synthesis. Potent hydroxyl radical scavenger, enhancing NO bioavailability.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Increases plasma NO by 38% after 3g/day for 4 weeks in type 2 diabetes patients. Vasodilation peaks ~1 hour post-dose (aligned with peak plasma levels). In isolated vessels, induces endothelial-dependent relaxation via NO release.
   - **Timing**: Onset ~30-60 minutes post-oral dose; peak effect at 1 hour; duration 2-4 hours due to short half-life. Chronic use (e.g., 6g/day for weeks) sustains effects like reduced arterial stiffness (small improvement, ~5-10% in meta-analyses).

2. **Improves Blood Pressure Regulation**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: NO-mediated vasodilation reduces vascular resistance. Effective in hypertension, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, Eisenmenger syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension. Attenuates cold-induced blood pressure spikes.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Reduces systolic BP by 4.1 mmHg (95% CI: -7.94 to -0.26) and diastolic by 2.08 mmHg (95% CI: -4.32 to 0.16) in meta-analyses (doses ≥6g/day show stronger diastolic effect: -2.75 mmHg). In heart failure, small improvement (~5-10 mmHg reduction).
   - **Timing**: Acute onset ~1 hour; chronic effects build over 1-8 weeks (e.g., 3g twice daily for 8 weeks in pregnancy studies).

3. **Enhances Exercise Performance and Reduces Fatigue**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: Boosts NO for better muscle blood flow and oxygen delivery; promotes aerobic energy production; reduces muscle soreness via anti-inflammatory effects. Relieves fatigue in conditions like obesity or chronic illness.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Improves muscular endurance (e.g., +10-20% reps in resistance training at 8g citrulline malate); reduces fatigue symptoms (small effect, ~10-15% in scales); increases power output (~5-7% in some studies); lowers blood lactate by 10-20% post-exercise. Oxygen uptake kinetics improved by ~10%.
   - **Timing**: Pre-exercise dose (6-8g) peaks at 1 hour; effects last 2-4 hours during activity. Chronic use (e.g., 6g/day) shows benefits over 1-17 weeks.

4. **Supports Urea Cycle and Ammonia Detoxification**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: Intermediate in urea cycle; converts toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. Useful in urea cycle disorders, short bowel syndrome (restores nitrogen balance), and hyperammonemia.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Reduces ammonia levels by 20-30% in models; increases urea production proportionally to dose.
   - **Timing**: Acute effects within hours; chronic stabilization over days (e.g., in sickle cell anemia).

5. **Improves Erectile Function**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: NO boosts penile blood flow; inhibits PDE5 (IC50: 366.7 µM, non-competitive). Better than placebo but less potent than Viagra.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Improves erection hardness score by ~1-2 points (mild-moderate ED); binding free energy to PDE5: -45.06 kcal/mol (higher affinity than sildenafil's -13.86 kcal/mol).
   - **Timing**: Onset ~1 hour; effects with chronic use (e.g., 1.5-3g/day for weeks).

6. **Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: Scavenges hydroxyl radicals; lowers IL-6 (in infections); reduces C-reactive protein in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. No effect on antioxidant enzymes in type 2 diabetes.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Lowers IL-6 by 20-30% in rat models; decreases CRP by ~10-20% (small effect).
   - **Timing**: Acute scavenging within minutes; chronic reductions over weeks.

7. **Immune Stimulation and Wound Healing**:
   - **Mechanism/Influence**: NO supports immune function; aids wound healing in diabetes via better blood flow.
   - **Timing**: Chronic effects over days-weeks.

8. **Other Effects**:
   - Reduces asthma symptoms in obesity (small improvement).
   - Potential in hyperlipidemia (lowers cholesterol), cancer chemotherapy (protects), Alzheimer's/multi-infarct dementia (neuroprotective via NO), sickle cell anemia (nitrogen balance), hyperoxic lung damage (protective).
   - No effect on blood glucose, aerobic/anaerobic capacity metrics, or anti-oxidant profiles in some contexts.
   - **Quantitative Values**: Variable; e.g., +10% exercise tolerance in heart failure.

### Half-Life
- Approximately 0.9-1 hour (e.g., 0.9 hour for 5g dose; 1 hour in general pharmacokinetics). In neonates, ~16 minutes (bolus IV). Rapid decline after peak (15-30 minutes post-peak regardless of dose).

### Bioavailabilities
- **Oral Route**: High bioavailability (~100% absorption); not limited by intestinal saturation (unlike arginine). Losses in urine are low (<1%). Converts ~80% to arginine systemically. Relative bioavailability of citrulline HCl vs. L-citrulline: 125% higher for arginine conversion at 6g dose; 226% at 2g dose (due to better conversion and less urinary loss: 3-6x advantage).
- **Other Routes**: IV bolus shows volume of distribution 302.89 mL, clearance 774.96 mL/h. Not typically used orally vs. other routes in data, but oral is preferred for supplements.
- Factors: Dose-dependent; peak plasma citrulline at 1 hour (e.g., 343 µM after 12g citrulline malate vs. 39 µM baseline). Arginine peaks at 60-120 minutes (faster with HCl form: 60 min vs. 120 min for L-citrulline).

### Dosages
- **Safe Range**: Generally safe up to 10-15g/day (chronic) or 15g single dose (no side effects in studies). Well-tolerated in rats up to 3g/kg (human equivalent ~30-40g/day for 60kg). In humans, up to 12g/day for 7 days or 15g single dose without issues.
- **Minimum Effective Dose**: 3g/day (e.g., for NO boost, BP reduction, or exercise). Lower doses (e.g., 2g citrulline HCl) still elevate arginine but with reduced Cmax/AUC (~25% lower vs. 6g L-citrulline).
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: 10g/day (exceeding may cause arginine oversaturation, potential hypotension, or GI issues). In studies, 15g single dose tolerated, but >10g/day not recommended long-term without monitoring.
- **LD50**: >16g/kg in rats (oral acute toxicity; very high, indicating low toxicity). For mice, analogs show similar high values (specific LD50 for citrulline not quantified in data, but amino acids like this are non-toxic at practical doses).
- **When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous**: >10g/day chronic or >15g single dose (risk of GI distress, hypotension if combined with BP meds; >50% plasma drop in dogs correlates with intestinal toxicity like necrosis). In rats/dogs, decreases >50% in plasma citrulline signal toxicity (e.g., crypt necrosis, diarrhea). No human fatalities reported; monitor for hypotension or GI symptoms.

Note: Dosages vary by form (e.g., citrulline malate: 1.76g per 1g citrulline). Consult a healthcare provider, especially with conditions like low BP or pregnancy (up to 6g/day studied safely). Side effects are rare (mainly GI); no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.
