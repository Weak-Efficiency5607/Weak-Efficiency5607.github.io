Here’s a **clear, fact-based summary of what is known about *Sigumir*** — based on the available scientific and product information — and what *is not documented* in credible pharmacology sources.

### ⚠️ Important Overall Note

**Sigumir is not a registered pharmaceutical drug in major regulatory systems (FDA, EMA, etc.).** The products marketed as *Sigumir* are **dietary supplements/bioregulators based on cartilage-derived peptide complexes**, not approved medicines with standardized pharmacokinetics or toxicity data. That means:

* There is **no verified clinical pharmacology profile (e.g., half-life, receptor binding, systemic bioavailability)** published in peer-reviewed journals.
* There are **no established LD50 values, therapeutic index, or safety thresholds** from controlled toxicology studies in humans.
* Dosage recommendations come from **product labeling and small clinical studies in Russia**, not mainstream pharmacological literature. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])

## 🧬 What *Sigumir* Is

**Sigumir** (a peptide bioregulator) is described as:

* A **complex of low–molecular-weight peptides** (often “peptide complex A-4”) extracted from cartilage and bone tissue of young animals. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])
* Intended to support **cartilage metabolism and joint health** and to promote regenerative processes in cartilage and bone cells. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2])
* Marketed as a *nutritional supplement* or *bioregulator*, not a pharmaceutical drug. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][3])

### Proposed Mechanisms (from product descriptions)

Reported effects are based on limited clinical and experimental descriptions, not established pharmacodynamics:

* **Stimulates chondrocyte function and cartilage repair** (metabolic support). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2])
* **Reduces joint inflammation and stiffness** (claimed). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2])
* **Supports lubrication and flexibility of joints** (claimed). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2])
* **Regulation of intracellular metabolic processes in cartilage and bone cells** (claimed). ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])

> **Important:** These mechanisms are proposed in marketing materials and small clinical observations; they are *not established in mainstream pharmacology texts.*

## 📈 Pharmacological Action Summary

| Action / Effect                         | Evidence Source       | Notes                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cartilage trophism / metabolism support | Supplement literature | Not confirmed by robust clinical trials. ([Anti Aging Peptides][4])          |
| Joint flexibility improvement           | Supplement literature | Described in product info. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2])                      |
| Anti-inflammatory effects               | Supplement literature | Claimed but not quantified in rigorous studies. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) |
| Bone tissue support                     | Supplement literature | Marketing claims exist. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])                   |

## 🧪 Pharmacokinetics & Bioavailability

There are **no reliable published values** for:

* **Absorption kinetics (e.g., plasma levels after oral dosing)**
* **Half-life (t½)**
* **Volume of distribution**
* **Clearance or metabolic pathways**
* **Bioavailability (oral or sublingual)**

Manufacturers claim that:

* Sublingual use may **increase bioavailability and onset speed versus swallowing** because it bypasses some first-pass metabolism. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])

But no validated data support specific percentage bioavailability or absorption time.

---

## 💊 Dosage Recommendations (Product-Based Only)

### Typical Dosing from Product Labels

* **Capsules:** 1–2 capsules, 1–2 times per day with meals. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][3])
* **Sublingual version:** ~10 drops under the tongue twice daily. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])
* **Course Duration:** Usually **1 month**, with optional repeated cycles. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1])

There is **no recognized “minimum effective dose” or “maximum safe dose”** in pharmacological literature.

---

## ⚠️ Safety, Toxicity, and LD50

There is **no published LD50 in humans or standardized animal toxicity data for Sigumir itself**.

* Because it’s a peptide supplement derived from animal tissue, **published acute toxicity values like LD50 are not available**.
* In general, toxicity for peptides derived from natural tissue is low, but this cannot be used to infer safety across individuals.
* Some supplements suggest “well-tolerated with no side effects,” but this has **no rigorous safety data backing it**. ([Anti Aging Peptides][4])

### Contraindications & Cautions

* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are typically advised **not to use** without medical supervision. ([Peptidi][5])
* Individuals with allergies or intolerances should exercise caution. ([Peptidi][5])

## 🛑 What We *Cannot* Provide (No Evidence Available)

Due to the lack of credible pharmacology data:

❌ **No half-life values**
❌ **No measured bioavailability percentages**
❌ **No receptor binding profiles**
❌ **No LD50 values for humans or animals beyond general peptide toxicity assumptions**
❌ **No standardized therapeutic index**

## 📌 Summary

| Parameter                     | Known / Unknown                                              |

| **LD50 / Toxicity Threshold** | *Not determined in formal studies*                           |

### ✅ Final Takeaway

**Sigumir should be regarded as a dietary supplement with claimed joint support properties, not as a pharmacologically characterized drug.** There is **no established pharmacokinetic or toxicology profile** in the medical literature, so precise values like half-life, LD50, bioavailability, or safety ranges simply do not exist in the scientific record.

If you want detailed clinical data or drug-like profiling, especially for research or medical purposes, you would need information from formal clinical pharmacology studies — which, to date, **are not available for Sigumir**.

If you need, I can help you find **published clinical studies on Sigumir** or **compare it with established cartilage-support drugs like glucosamine/chondroitin**.
