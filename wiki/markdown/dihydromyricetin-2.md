### Potentially Adverse Pharmacological Actions of Dihydromyricetin (DHM/Ampelopsin) in Chronic Pathogen Infection and Immunodeficiency

Dihydromyricetin (DHM), also known as Ampelopsin, is a flavonoid with well-documented anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. While these are generally beneficial in conditions involving excessive inflammation (e.g., autoimmune diseases), they could be detrimental in the context of **chronic pathogen infections** (e.g., viral like HIV or HBV, bacterial like tuberculosis) or **immunodeficiency** (e.g., HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy-induced). In such scenarios, a robust pro-inflammatory response is often essential for pathogen clearance, immune cell activation (e.g., macrophages, T-cells), and cytokine signaling to sustain adaptive immunity. Suppressing these could delay pathogen control, promote viral latency, or exacerbate opportunistic infections.

Based on available data, DHM does not exhibit direct broad-spectrum immunosuppression (e.g., no evidence of T-cell anergy or broad B-cell inhibition). However, its **anti-inflammatory actions**—primarily via NF-κB pathway inhibition and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production—could indirectly weaken innate and adaptive immune responses. It may also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, limiting IL-1β-mediated defenses against intracellular pathogens.

Below is a comprehensive table summarizing these actions, including quantitative values (doses/concentrations), durations, models, observed influences, and why they could be adverse. Data are drawn from preclinical studies (in vitro/in vivo); human data are limited, with no direct trials in infection/immunodeficiency contexts. I've included the most values available, prioritizing those tied to immune/inflammatory endpoints. Effects are dose- and time-dependent, with higher doses/long durations amplifying suppression.

| Pharmacological Action | Key Mechanism/Influence on Immunity | Quantitative Values (Dose/Concentration) | Duration of Exposure | Model/System | Potential Adverse Impact in Chronic Infection/Immunodeficiency | Source Citation |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Inhibition of NF-κB pathway activation** | Binds IKKβ, prevents IκBα phosphorylation/degradation, blocks p65 nuclear translocation; reduces expression of NF-κB target genes (e.g., iNOS, COX-2). Suppresses macrophage/microglia activation and pro-inflammatory signaling. | - 200 μM (preincubation)<br>- 6.25–25 μM (dose-dependent inhibition)<br>- 100–400 mg/kg/day (restores cytokine levels but suppresses excess) | - 12 h preincubation + 30 min stimulus<br>- 24 h treatment<br>- 6 weeks | - In vitro: HeLa cells (TNF-α stimulated)<br>- In vitro: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS; IL-1β stimulated)<br>- In vivo: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats | Impairs innate immune activation (e.g., reduced macrophage cytokine burst needed for bacterial/viral killing); in immunodeficiency, further hinders weak NF-κB-dependent antiviral responses (e.g., IFN production). Could prolong chronic viral persistence. |  <br> <br>  |
| **Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6)** | Downregulates cytokine mRNA/protein via NF-κB/TLR4 inhibition; reduces endothelial/microglial secretion. Also modulates IL-2/IL-6 in neurons. | - 200 μM (reduces TNF-α/IL-1β)<br>- 500 μM (92% inhibition rate; reduces TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6 by >50%)<br>- 125 mg/kg (alleviates but suppresses intestinal cytokines) | - 12 h preincubation + 12 h stimulus<br>- 2–24 h post-infection<br>- 7 days | - In vitro: HeLa/BV-2 microglial cells (LPS/TNF-α stimulated)<br>- In vitro: PK-15 cells (Pseudorabies virus infected)<br>- In vivo: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice | Blunts cytokine storm control but risks under-dampening needed for T-cell priming/Th1 responses in chronic infections; in immunodeficiency, low baseline cytokines drop further, worsening opportunistic infections (e.g., fungal). |  <br> <br>  |
| **Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis** | Reduces mitochondrial ROS, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β release; limits foam cell formation and endothelial pyroptosis. | - 50–100 μM (dose-dependent NLRP3 suppression)<br>- Not specified (in vivo reduction) | - 24 h treatment<br>- 4–8 weeks | - In vitro: HUVECs/ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages<br>- In vivo: SIRT3 knockout atherosclerosis mice | IL-1β is critical for antifungal/Th17 immunity; suppression could impair defense against chronic intracellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium); exacerbates immunodeficiency by reducing inflammasome-driven alerts to adaptive immunity. |   |
| **Reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration/recruitment** | Decreases eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages in tissues; inhibits mast cell degranulation via STAT5/NF-κB. | - 1 mg/kg (i.p.; reduces cell infiltration)<br>- 2 mg/kg (every 3 days; abolishes NF-κB-driven recruitment) | - 2–4 weeks<br>- 12 weeks | - In vivo: Ovalbumin-induced asthmatic/APP/PS1 mice<br>- In vivo: High-fat diet LDLR-/- mice | Limits neutrophil/macrophage recruitment essential for abscess formation/phagocytosis in chronic bacterial infections; in immunodeficiency, reduces already sparse immune cell trafficking to infection sites. |  <br>  |
| **Upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1ra)** | Increases IL-1ra (receptor antagonist) to counter pro-inflammatory signals; balances but shifts toward suppression. | - 250–500 mg/kg (increases IL-1ra levels) | - 8 weeks | - In vivo: Ethanol-fed mice (liver inflammation model) | Enhances resolution but overly tips balance, potentially silencing residual inflammation needed for chronic pathogen containment; risky in immunodeficiency where pro-inflammation is already deficient. |   |
| **Suppression of TLR4/MyD88 signaling** | Inhibits TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation, reducing downstream cytokine/NO production in microglia/endothelia. | - 50–200 μM (concentration-dependent) | - 24 h | - In vitro: BV-2 microglial cells (LPS-stimulated) | TLR4 is key for bacterial LPS recognition; inhibition could delay innate detection of chronic Gram-negative infections, compounding immunodeficiency-related susceptibility. |   |

### Key Insights on Influence and Timing
- **Dose-Dependency**: Effects strengthen at higher doses (e.g., >100 μM in vitro or >100 mg/kg in vivo), with IC50 values around 48–161 μM for pathway inhibition. Low doses (e.g., 1–6.25 μM) may have minimal impact.
- **Time-Dependency**: Acute (hours) suppression dominates in vitro (e.g., rapid NF-κB block within 30 min post-stimulus); chronic (weeks) exposure in vivo leads to sustained cytokine reduction (e.g., 6–12 weeks normalizes but dampens levels). Short-term use (<1 week) may have transient effects, while prolonged (>4 weeks) risks cumulative immune dampening.
- **Overall Risk Profile**: These actions are more concerning in **chronic settings** where immune vigilance is key, rather than acute. No toxicity reported at these doses, but bioavailability is low (~4% in rats), so human equivalents may require higher intake. Consult a physician before use in infection/immunodeficiency; benefits (e.g., antioxidant) may outweigh in some cases.
- **Data Gaps**: Few studies quantify exact "bad" outcomes in infection models; most focus on benefits. Human trials (e.g., 970 mg/day for diabetes, 1 month) show cytokine reduction without infection context.
