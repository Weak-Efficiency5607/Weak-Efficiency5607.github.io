### Pharmacological Actions of AICA Ribonucleotide (AICAR)
AICA ribonucleotide, also known as AICAR or acadesine, is an intermediate in purine biosynthesis and an analog of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). It primarily acts as an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. However, some effects are AMPK-independent. Below is a comprehensive list of its main pharmacological actions, along with how each influences the body or relevant systems. These are derived from preclinical, clinical, and mechanistic studies, as AICAR is not approved for routine human therapeutic use and remains experimental.

1. **AMPK Activation**  
   - **Influence**: Mimics cellular energy depletion by increasing intracellular ZMP (AICAR monophosphate), which binds to AMPK's γ-subunit, leading to allosteric activation, Thr172 phosphorylation by LKB1, and protection against dephosphorylation. This promotes catabolic processes (e.g., glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation) and inhibits anabolic ones (e.g., protein/lipid synthesis). Results in improved metabolic efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and enhanced adaptation to stress like exercise or ischemia. In skeletal muscle, it mimics endurance training by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity via PGC-1α upregulation. In adipose tissue, it reduces fat accumulation. AMPK-independent effects include direct inhibition of nucleotide synthesis enzymes.

2. **Metabolic Regulation (Glucose and Lipid Metabolism)**  
   - **Influence**: Enhances insulin-independent glucose uptake in muscle and liver via GLUT4 translocation, lowers blood glucose, and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Increases fatty acid oxidation and inhibits lipolysis, reducing plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol. In obese models, it normalizes dyslipidemia and improves insulin sensitivity, potentially aiding type 2 diabetes management. Influences energy homeostasis in embryonic stem cells and podocytes, ameliorating high-fructose-induced disturbances.

3. **Cardioprotection Against Ischemia**  
   - **Influence**: Inhibits adenosine kinase and deaminase in cardiac cells, increasing adenosine levels during ischemia, which enhances nucleotide re-synthesis and preserves blood flow. Reduces myocardial infarction risk, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Used clinically in the 1980s-1990s for cardiac surgery protection; reduces early cardiac death and adverse outcomes in bypass patients.

4. **Anti-Cancer and Apoptotic Effects**  
   - **Influence**: Induces apoptosis in cancer cells (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma) via upregulation of BH3-only proteins (BIM, NOXA) or p53-independent pathways, inhibiting mTORC1 and autophagy in some contexts. Suppresses tumor growth in xenografts by elevating ZMP, disrupting purine biosynthesis, and reducing proliferation. Effects can be AMPK-independent, involving nucleotide imbalance. In hematological malignancies, it shows antileukemic activity at tolerable plasma levels (0.9 mM).

5. **Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Cachectic Effects**  
   - **Influence**: Suppresses inflammation-induced muscle wasting (e.g., in cancer cachexia) by inhibiting IFNγ/TNFα pathways, independent of mitochondrial effects. Reduces adipose tissue inflammation, improving glucose tolerance. In osteoarthritis, enhances chondrocyte autophagy and regulates cholesterol metabolism.

6. **Neuroprotective and Anti-Neurodegenerative Effects**  
   - **Influence**: Activates autophagy via mTORC1 inhibition, potentially protecting against neurodegenerative diseases. In diabetic polyneuropathy models, regulates mitophagy, preventing/reversing nerve damage. Poor blood-brain barrier penetration limits direct CNS effects.

7. **Exercise-Mimetic and Performance-Enhancing Effects**  
   - **Influence**: Increases muscle endurance by switching to oxidative fibers, enhancing mitochondrial function, and upregulating enzymes like succinate dehydrogenase. Mimics exercise benefits without physical activity, but banned in sports as a metabolic modulator.

8. **Nucleotide Synthesis Modulation**  
   - **Influence**: Inhibits purine and pyrimidine synthesis as a substrate in de novo pathways, leading to accumulation of intermediates like SAICAR. Affects DNA/RNA synthesis, contributing to anti-proliferative effects in cancer.

9. **Hypoxia and Stress Response**  
   - **Influence**: Enhances adaptation to low oxygen via AMPK, stabilizing HIF-1α and promoting angiogenesis or metabolic shifts. Some effects are AMPK-independent.

10. **Other Effects**: Regulates pluripotency in stem cells via PI3K/GSK3β/β-catenin; ameliorates insulin resistance in obesity; protects against radiation in some models.

### Pharmacokinetics
- **Half-Life**: Approximately 1-5 hours in human plasma (e.g., 1.4 hours post-IV infusion; estimates vary by study). Cellular ZMP (active metabolite) persists longer, sustaining effects.
- **Bioavailability**: Oral <5% (poor absorption); IV administration preferred for full systemic exposure. Subcutaneous or intraperitoneal used in research, but not clinically standardized.
- **Absorption/Distribution**: Rapidly absorbed IV; distributes to tissues like muscle, heart, and liver. Poor blood-brain barrier penetration.
- **Metabolism/Elimination**: Converted to ZMP by adenosine kinase; cleared renally; may elevate uric/lactic acid at high doses.

### Dosages
AICAR is experimental and not FDA-approved for human use. Dosages are from clinical trials (primarily IV for cardiac protection or leukemia) and animal studies. No established "safe range" for routine use, but tolerability data exist.

- **Clinical Trials (Humans, IV)**: 
  - Single doses: 50-315 mg/kg (maximum tolerated dose [MTD] 210 mg/kg; optimal biological dose [OBD] 210 mg/kg).
  - Multiple doses: 210 mg/kg over 2-5 days.
  - Phase I/II (e.g., CLL): Up to 210 mg/kg, achieving plasma levels of 0.9 mM.
  - Cardiac surgery: 0.6-10 g total (e.g., 100-210 mg/kg perioperatively).
  - Minimum Effective: ~10-50 mg/kg for metabolic effects in early trials.
  - Maximum Without High Risks: 210 mg/kg (adverse effects increase above this; e.g., hyperuricemia, hypotension).

- **Animal/Preclinical Studies**:
  - Metabolic/diabetes models: 250-500 mg/kg/day (IP/SC) for 4-13 weeks.
  - Exercise-mimetic: 0.5-1 g/kg/day.
  - Neuropathy: 500 mg/kg (SC, 3 days/week for months).

- **Safe Range (Human Data)**: Up to 210 mg/kg IV single/multiple doses tolerated with mild/transient side effects (e.g., hyperuricemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, renal impairment). Equivalent oral doses (10-100 mg/kg) show poor efficacy due to low bioavailability but similar safety.
- **Minimum Effective Dose**: Varies; ~10-50 mg/kg IV for AMPK activation/metabolic effects.
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: 210 mg/kg IV (MTD); higher risks above this include clinically significant hypotension/renal issues.
- **When Dangerous**: Starts at >210 mg/kg IV (e.g., grade ≥2 toxicities like severe hyperuricemia or hypotension). No human overdose data; animal models show no acute lethality at 500 mg/kg, but chronic high doses cause lactic/uric acid buildup.

### Toxicity and LD50
- **LD50**: Not available for humans. Predicted rat oral LD50: ~2.4 mol/kg (low acute toxicity). No experimental LD50 reported; considered low-toxicity based on trials (no deaths at 315 mg/kg IV).
- **Estimation of Danger**: Becomes "too dangerous" at >210 mg/kg IV (increased risk of uric acid elevation, hypotension, renal impairment). Chronic use may amplify metabolic disturbances (e.g., lactic acidosis). Not highly toxic acutely, but off-target effects (e.g., nucleotide disruption) limit long-term safety. Banned in sports; avoid non-research use.
