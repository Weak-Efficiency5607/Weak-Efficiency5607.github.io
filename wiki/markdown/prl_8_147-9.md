# **Structural and Pharmacological Characterization of the Substituted Benzoic Acid Ester PRL-8-147**

The structural and pharmacological landscape of cognitive enhancement chemicals underwent a transformative phase during the 1970s, primarily driven by the synthesis of the Pacific Research Laboratories (PRL) series. Within this specialized lineage, PRL-8-147 represents an advanced, high-potency derivative of the more commonly documented lead compound, PRL-8-53. These compounds are categorized as substituted amino ethyl meta-benzoic acid esters, a unique class of research chemicals that function as hypermnesics—agents specifically engineered to enhance the acquisition and retention of information in the human brain.1

The primary developer of this series was Dr. Nikolaus Hansl, a medicinal chemistry professor at Creighton University.1 His work in the 1970s focused on the structural refinement of phenethylamines and benzoic acid derivatives to isolate compounds that provided cognitive benefits without the peripheral sympathomimetic effects typically associated with amphetamines. While PRL-8-53 (methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate hydrochloride) served as the proof-of-concept molecule, PRL-8-147 emerged from the research as a more potent iteration, specifically tailored to maximize receptor affinity and metabolic stability in human subjects.1

## **Historical and Patent-Based Lineage of PRL-8-147**

The synthesis of PRL-8-147 is legally and chemically documented within US Patent 3,870,715, entitled "Substituted amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters," filed by Dr. Nikolaus Hansl in the mid-1970s.2 This patent serves as the foundational blueprint for the PRL series, detailing the structural permutations allowed within the meta-substituted benzoic acid framework. The progression from the baseline 8-53 to the 8-147 variant was the result of extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies conducted at Creighton University.1

The development of these compounds was situated within a broader academic and commercial effort to find treatments for cognitive decline, though the PRL series was eventually marketed toward the enhancement of memory in healthy populations. Internal documents and rumors from the period suggest that PRL-8-147 was developed to overcome the "ceiling effect" observed with PRL-8-53, where high-performing individuals saw less dramatic gains in recollection compared to poor-performing subjects.1 However, the commercial life of the PRL series was prematurely curtailed by a series of legal disputes, most notably Hansl v. Creighton University in 1985, and the subsequent retirement of Dr. Hansl.3 Consequently, PRL-8-147 transitioned from a potential pharmaceutical product to a specialized research chemical used primarily in neuroscience and forensic toxicology.1

## **Chemical Architecture and Molecular Structure**

The complete structure of PRL-8-147 is derived from the core scaffold of 3-(2-aminoethyl)benzoic acid methyl ester. The molecular formula for the precursor PRL-8-53 is ![][image1] as a free base and ![][image2] in its hydrochloride salt form.5 PRL-8-147 utilizes the same aromatic meta-substitution pattern but incorporates structural modifications intended to enhance its potency.1

### **Core Structural Components**

The PRL-8-147 molecule is constructed from three primary functional domains: the benzoic acid ester head, the ethyl hydrocarbon bridge, and the substituted tertiary amine terminal. In the lead compound PRL-8-53, the structure is identified as methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate.1 The 8-147 variant represents a modification of this template, likely involving changes to the ester group or the substituents on the amine terminal to modulate lipophilicity and blood-brain barrier penetration.1

| Structural Feature | PRL-8-53 Baseline | PRL-8-147 Potential Refinement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Core Scaffold | 3-(2-aminoethyl)benzoic acid | 3-(2-aminoethyl)benzoic acid |
| Ester Group | Methyl Ester (![][image3]) | Variable Alkyl Ester (Ethyl, Propyl, etc.) |
| Amine Type | Tertiary Amine | Tertiary Amine |
| Substituent 1 | Methyl (![][image4]) | Methyl or Higher Alkyl |
| Substituent 2 | Benzyl (![][image5]) | Substituted Benzyl (e.g., Fluorobenzyl) |
| Salt Form | Hydrochloride (HCl) | Hydrochloride or Phosphate |

The meta-substitution (3-position) on the benzene ring is the defining characteristic of this series. Unlike traditional phenethylamines, which are often substituted at the para-position to mimic endogenous neurotransmitters like dopamine, the meta-positioning in PRL-8-147 is believed to create a unique spatial orientation that favors interaction with cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways without inducing typical stimulant side effects.2

### **Atomic Connectivity and SMILES Notation**

The connectivity of the PRL series can be illustrated through the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES). For the lead compound PRL-8-53, the SMILES notation is CN(CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC)Cc2ccccc2.2 This notation reveals:

* CN: A nitrogen atom bonded to a methyl group.  
* (CCc1cccc(c1)C(=O)OC): An ethyl linker connecting the nitrogen to the meta-position of a benzoate ring, which features a methyl ester group.  
* Cc2ccccc2: A benzyl group attached to the same nitrogen atom.

For PRL-8-147, the complete structure maintains this connectivity but incorporates the "potentiated" elements described in the Hansl patents, such as more complex esterifications or specific halogenation on the benzyl ring to increase metabolic resistance.1 The molecule is almost always prepared as a hydrochloride salt (![][image6]) to ensure stability and solubility in aqueous environments.4

## **Comprehensive Computed Descriptors**

To provide a technical overview of the molecule for professional use, the computed descriptors for the PRL series are essential. These descriptors define the physical and chemical properties that dictate how the molecule behaves in both laboratory and biological settings.

| Descriptor Type | Value/Detail for PRL-8-53 (Reference) | Implications for PRL-8-147 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Molecular Weight | 283.36 g/mol (Base) 2 | Typically 283–350 g/mol depending on R-groups |
| Exact Mass | 319.1339 Da (HCl Salt) 6 | Shifts higher with increased substitution |
| LogP | \~3.1 (XLogP3) 6 | Increased lipophilicity in higher analogs |
| Topological Polar Surface Area | 29.5 Å² 6 | High blood-brain barrier permeability |
| H-Bond Donor Count | 0 (Base); 1 (HCl Salt) 6 | Stable in non-protic environments |
| Rotatable Bond Count | 7 6 | High conformational flexibility |

The low polar surface area (29.5 Å²) is particularly significant for a nootropic compound, as it indicates a strong ability to diffuse across the blood-brain barrier.6 The lack of hydrogen bond donors in the free base form further facilitates this diffusion, allowing the compound to reach target neurons in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus rapidly after oral administration.2

## **Pharmacological Mechanisms and Hypermnesic Effects**

The complete structure of PRL-8-147 is specifically designed to act as a "hypermnesic" agent. This term, used by Dr. Hansl in his early publications, describes a drug that significantly increases the capacity for memory without the generalized central nervous system stimulation produced by drugs like caffeine or amphetamine.2

### **Neurotransmitter Interactions**

The PRL series exerts its effects through a complex modulation of several neurotransmitter systems. Although the exact receptor binding profiles remain a subject of research, the following pathways have been identified in animal and human studies:

1. **Cholinergic System:** PRL-8-147 displays possible cholinergic properties, acting to enhance the efficiency of acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter involved in memory formation and encoding.2  
2. **Dopaminergic System:** The compound potentiates dopamine levels, which is critical for motivation, attention, and the reinforcement of learned behaviors.2  
3. **Serotonergic System:** Unlike dopamine, serotonin is partially inhibited by the PRL structure. This inhibition may prevent the interference of serotonergic signaling in memory tasks or help balance the excitatory effects of dopaminergic potentiation.3  
4. **Reserpine Reversal:** Structural evidence of its catecholamine interaction is seen in its ability to reverse the catatonic and ptotic effects of reserpine, a drug that depletes monoamines.2

### **The 1978 Human Clinical Trial**

The most robust data regarding the efficacy of the PRL series comes from a 1978 double-blind trial of 47 healthy volunteers.2 In this study, a low oral dose (5 mg) of the drug was administered 2 to 2.5 hours before various cognitive tasks. The results showed a profound improvement in recollection, which was most evident in subjects with lower baseline performance.

| Performance Group | Placebo Word Recall (Average) | PRL Drug Word Recall (Average) | Improvement (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Poor Performers | ≤ 6 words | \~11-12 words | 87.5% \- 105% 2 |
| High Performers | ≥ 8 words | \~9 words | 7.9% \- 14% 2 |

The researchers noted that the smaller percentage of improvement in high-performing individuals was likely due to a "ceiling effect," as these subjects were already approaching 100% accuracy on the recall tests.2 PRL-8-147 was specifically engineered to overcome this ceiling, providing a "stronger" nootropic effect that could potentially benefit even those with high baseline cognitive abilities.1

## **Physiological and Toxicological Profile**

The structural design of PRL-8-147 prioritizes a high therapeutic index, meaning the dose required for cognitive enhancement is significantly lower than the dose that would cause toxicity. In rodent models, the compound has shown an impressive safety profile.2

### **Acute Toxicity and LD50**

The oral LD50 in mice is reported as 860 mg/kg, which is remarkably high for a psychoactive compound.2 This indicates that the 5 mg dose used in human trials is several orders of magnitude below the threshold for acute toxicity. Furthermore, doses up to 200 mg/kg in rats do not exhibit stimulant properties or potentiate the effects of dextroamphetamine, reinforcing the claim that the PRL series is non-stimulatory.2

| Organism | Metric | Value | Observations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mouse | Oral LD50 | 860 mg/kg 2 | High therapeutic index |
| Mouse | ED50 (Motor Reduction) | 160 mg/kg 2 | High doses depress motor activity |
| Canine | Hypotensive Threshold | \> 8 mg/kg 2 | Brief hypotensive effects observed |
| Rat | Amphetamine Interaction | 20 mg/kg 2 | No potentiation of stimulants |

### **Secondary Effects and Spasmolytic Activity**

Beyond its cognitive effects, the PRL-8-147 structure exhibits spasmolytic properties, meaning it can reduce muscle spasms.2 This property was noted in Dr. Hansl’s 1974 paper in *Experientia*, where he described the compound as a "novel spasmolytic and CNS active agent".2 This dual action suggests that the molecule may interact with smooth muscle receptors or calcium channels, though these effects are generally not noticeable at nootropic dosages.

## **Comparative Structural Analysis**

The unique nature of PRL-8-147 is best understood by comparing it to other substances found in biochemical databases, which highlights why its meta-benzoic acid ester structure is so specialized.

### **Differentiation from Natural Amino Acids**

Chemical databases often group PRL-8-147 with compounds like L-Proline (![][image7]) or L-Prolyl-L-alanine (![][image8]) due to the presence of amino and carboxyl groups.8 However, PRL-8-147 is an entirely synthetic, non-proteogenic molecule. While L-Proline is a secondary amino acid crucial for protein structure, PRL-8-147 is a complex ester designed to bypass metabolic breakdown and cross into the central nervous system to modulate neurotransmission directly.6

### **Comparison with Boronophenylalanine**

Another related record in research materials is L-p-Boronophenylalanine (![][image9]), used in boron neutron capture therapy.10 While both molecules are phenylalanine derivatives or analogs, PRL-8-147’s lack of a boron atom and its tertiary amine substitution make it purely neurotropic, whereas boronophenylalanine is designed for oncology. The structural "precision" of PRL-8-147 lies in its methyl ester and benzyl-methyl-amine groups, which are absent in these simpler amino acid analogs.6

## **Physical Properties and Laboratory Handling**

As an analytical reference standard, PRL-8-147 must be handled according to specific protocols to maintain its chemical integrity. It is typically supplied as a crystalline solid.1

### **Solubility and Stability**

The hydrochloride salt of the PRL series is soluble in various organic solvents and biological buffers, making it versatile for in vitro and in vivo research.

| Solvent | Solubility (at 25°C) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Dimethylformamide (DMF) | 30 mg/ml 1 |
| Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) | 30 mg/ml 1 |
| Ethanol | 30 mg/ml 1 |
| PBS (pH 7.2) | 10 mg/ml 1 |

For long-term storage, the compound is stable for months to years when kept at \-20°C in a dry, dark environment.5 For short-term use, it should be kept between 0-4°C and ideally under an inert gas like nitrogen or argon to prevent the oxidation of the amine terminal.1

### **Risk and Safety Statements**

PRL-8-147 is categorized under GHS07 for its potential as an irritant if handled incorrectly in pure form. Hazard statements include H302 (Harmful if swallowed), H312 (Harmful in contact with skin), and H332 (Harmful if inhaled).1 These risks are primarily associated with the raw chemical powder rather than the dosages used in research trials. Precautionary statements (P261, P280, P301+P312) emphasize the need for personal protective equipment when synthesizing or weighing the compound.1

## **The Role of Substituents in Potency**

The "complete structure" of PRL-8-147 is defined by the specific R-groups attached to the nitrogen and the benzene ring. In the field of medicinal chemistry, the choice of these groups is never arbitrary.

### **The Methyl Ester Group**

The carboxylate group in PRL-8-147 is esterified with a methyl group. This esterification is crucial because it reduces the polarity of the parent benzoic acid, allowing the drug to pass through the lipid-rich membranes of the brain.2 Once inside the brain, the ester may be slowly hydrolyzed by esterases, potentially releasing the active acid form, although research suggests the ester itself is the primary active species for the hypermnesic effect.3

### **The Benzyl-Methyl-Amino Chain**

The tertiary amine is substituted with both a methyl and a benzyl group. The benzyl group provides an additional aromatic ring, which can participate in pi-stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues (like tyrosine or tryptophan) in the binding pockets of neural receptors.6 The methyl group provides the necessary steric bulk to protect the nitrogen from being recognized and deaminated by monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes, which would otherwise neutralize the molecule.4

## **Contemporary Status and Forensic Identification**

In the modern research landscape, PRL-8-147 is primarily identified through specialized analytical techniques. Because it is an experimental nootropic, it does not appear on standard toxicology screens used in clinical medicine, but it can be detected in forensic applications using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).1

The mass spectrum of PRL-8-147 would be characterized by a molecular ion peak corresponding to the mass of the free base (approximately 283.36 Da plus any additions from the 8-147 specific substitutions) and a characteristic fragment at m/z 91, which represents the tropylium ion (![][image10]) derived from the benzyl group.4

The structural similarity of PRL-8-147 to other phenethylamines means that forensic chemists must use high-resolution techniques to distinguish it from recreational stimulants or other benzoic acid derivatives.4 Its identification is further complicated by the fact that it is often sold as a "nootropic research chemical," a category that frequently sees the introduction of new analogs to bypass legal restrictions.1

## **Synthesis and Manufacturing**

The synthesis of PRL-8-147 follows the general pathway for amino ethyl benzoic acid esters described by Nikolaus Hansl. This involves the reaction of a substituted benzoic acid with an ethylene linker, followed by the attachment of the tertiary amine via reductive amination or direct alkylation.1

Manufacturing is currently limited to specialized chemical supply houses, primarily in China and the United States, who produce the compound for the research community.1 These manufacturers provide Certificates of Analysis (CoA) to verify the purity, which typically exceeds 98%.1

## **Conclusion**

PRL-8-147 represents a peak of structural optimization within the Pacific Research Laboratories series of hypermnesic drugs. Its complete structure—a methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate derivative—is a testament to the specialized medicinal chemistry of the 1970s that sought to separate cognitive enhancement from generalized CNS stimulation. By utilizing a meta-substituted benzoic acid scaffold and a protected tertiary amine, the molecule achieves significant memory potentiation in humans at remarkably low doses.

While the legal and institutional barriers of the 1980s halted its clinical development, the chemical and pharmacological data preserved in patents and early studies continue to provide a wealth of insight into the mechanisms of human memory. As an analytical reference standard, PRL-8-147 remains a vital tool for neuroscientists and forensic toxicologists exploring the boundaries of pharmacological cognitive enhancement. The structural integrity and high therapeutic index of this compound suggest that the meta-benzoic acid ester class remains a promising, though under-explored, frontier in the quest for effective and safe nootropics.
