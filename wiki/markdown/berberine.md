Yes, berberine, a natural alkaloid found in certain plants, has been extensively studied for its interactions with the immune system. It exhibits immunomodulatory effects, such as suppressing pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells while promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th2 cells, which helps balance immune responses in conditions like autoimmune diseases. This modulation can reduce inflammation by inhibiting cytokine production and restoring Th1/Th2 equilibrium, potentially aiding in scenarios like COVID-19 by preventing cytokine storms and enhancing cell-mediated immunity. Berberine also promotes innate immunity through pathways like p38 MAPK, which activates immune cells to fight infections. Additionally, it influences macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, further attenuating inflammatory responses in tissues like the gut.

Regarding immunodeficiency, berberine shows relevance in conditions involving compromised immunity, such as HIV infection. It demonstrates antiviral activity against HIV and other viruses like herpes simplex and human cytomegalovirus, potentially inhibiting replication. In people living with HIV under virological suppression, berberine has been found safe and effective in improving metabolic syndrome components without adverse effects on immune status. It may also address immune dysfunction in disorders like immune thrombocytopenia by correcting corticosteroid resistance linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, while berberine can suppress overactive immune responses in autoimmune contexts (e.g., multiple sclerosis or colitis), there is no evidence it directly causes or worsens immunodeficiency; instead, its effects appear context-dependent, often supportive in deficient states.
