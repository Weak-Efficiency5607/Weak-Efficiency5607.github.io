Here’s the **most accurate, science-based summary possible** of what *peptide complex A-5* is and what is (and isn’t) known about its **pharmacological actions, kinetics (half-life, bioavailability), dosages, and toxicity** — based on credible research and verified product information. **There is no reliable, peer-reviewed pharmacological data on “A-5 peptide complex” (as sold commercially) that provides detailed actions, half-lives, bioavailability, dose-response curves, LD50, or safety margins in humans.** This answer clarifies what *is* documented versus what is *claimed without robust evidence.*

## 🧬 What *Peptide Complex A-5* Actually Is

**Peptide complex A-5** (often marketed under names like “Cerluten” or “A-5 Cerluten”) is a **dietary peptide supplement** — not an approved drug — typically extracted from **brain tissue of young animals** (often calves) and sold as a *peptide bioregulator*. ([Qi Supplements][1])

* It is often described by suppliers as a mix of short brain-derived peptides intended to *support central nervous system functions*. ([peptide-shop.com][2])
* The **composition and precise sequences of the peptides** in A-5 are *not disclosed in scientific literature or regulatory filings*. No peer-reviewed pharmacology exists for this complex as a defined compound.
* It is classified and marketed as a **nutritional/food supplement**, not a pharmaceutical drug. This distinction matters for evidence standards and safety evaluation.

## ⚠️ Scientific Evidence vs. Product Claims

### ⚬ Scientific Evidence

• Peer-reviewed research on “peptide bioregulators” in Russia suggests that **short peptides can affect gene expression and protein synthesis in cells** in *experimental* models. However, **these studies are generally low-quality, mostly Russian reports, and not specific to A-5**. ([PubMed][3])

• General literature on therapeutic peptides shows that peptides typically have **short half-lives**, limited oral bioavailability, and require parenteral routes for meaningful systemic exposure. ([PubMed][4])

### ⚬ Product/Marketing Claims

Peptide bioregulator sellers claim effects such as:

* improved brain metabolism and cognitive function,
* support for recovery after neurological injury,
* slowing of age-related decline.
  These claims are **not supported by robust clinical trials in humans** and are typical of *nutritional supplement marketing*. ([peptide-shop.com][2])

## 🧪 Pharmacological Actions — What Is Known

Because **A-5 is not a defined drug molecule with known structure**, we can’t give reliable *specific* pharmacodynamics like receptor targets or measurable effects.

**What can be said in general (from peptide biology):**

✔ Short peptides can modulate:

* cellular protein synthesis,
* gene expression,
* cell regulatory processes in vitro and in some animal studies.
  But **none of these have been demonstrated in rigorous human trials for A-5 specifically**. ([PubMed][3])

✔ There is **no validated mechanism of action** for A-5 in humans, e.g., binding to specific receptors or known neurotransmitter pathways.

---

## 📈 Pharmacokinetics — Half-Life & Bioavailability

There is **no published PK data for A-5**, period. So we must rely on general peptide pharmacology:

### 🔹 Half-Life (general peptides)

* Unmodified peptides (<10 kDa) are rapidly degraded by proteases and cleared renally, often with **half-lives from minutes to a few hours**. ([PubMed][4])

### 🔹 Bioavailability

Peptides taken by mouth usually have **very poor systemic bioavailability** due to digestion. ([PubMed][4])
Possible routes and relative likelihood of absorption:

* **Oral swallowed** — typically ~0% (most are digested).
* **Sublingual** — may allow some direct mucosal absorption, but *quantitative systemic absorption is unknown or negligible*.
* **Parenteral (e.g., IV, SC)** — highest potential bioavailability but is *not how A-5 is normally used*.

### 📌 Key Point

There’s **no validated measurement** of A-5’s half-life, Cmax, Tmax, or bioavailability in humans.

---

## 💊 Dosage & Safety

### 🟡 Common Product Dosage (Supplement Instructions)

* **Sublingual:** ~5–6 drops (~0.25–0.35 mL) 3–4 times daily (≈2.5–3.5 mg/day) for ~1 month. ([peptide-shop.com][2])
* Capsules, when sold, often contain ~10 mg per capsule. ([eBay][5])

These are **marketing recommendations**, *not clinical dose-responses*.

### ⚠ Toxicity and Safety Data

There are **no high-quality clinical toxicity studies** for A-5.

* No LD50 (lethal dose 50) is established in humans.
* No safety margins are scientifically defined.

Because peptide extracts can vary and absorption is poorly understood, the concept of “safe range” versus “dangerous dose” cannot be reliably determined for A-5 specifically.

**In short:** *A-5 peptide complex as sold in supplements has no reliable, verifiable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data published in peer-reviewed scientific literature.* Claims about effects are based on marketing, tradition, or low-quality studies, not validated biomedical research.

## 🧠 General Things Known About Peptide Drugs (for context)

From the broader peptide drug class:

* Peptides generally have **short half-lives** due to enzymatic degradation. ([PubMed][4])
* Oral bioavailability of peptides is typically very low without special formulation. ([PubMed][4])
* Parenteral administration (IV/SC) increases systemic exposure. ([PubMed][4])
* Clinical toxicity and LD50 values are established only for rigorously studied peptide drugs — not for unstandardized peptide supplements. ([PMC][6])

## ⚡ Bottom Line

**Peptide complex A-5 is a marketed nutritional peptide supplement with no high-quality scientific data on its pharmacology, kinetics, or safety.** Any specific numbers (half-life, bioavailability, dose thresholds, LD50) cannot be provided because they simply don’t exist in credible sources.

If your intent is *research or therapeutic understanding*, the relevant peptides with detailed data are those in clinical development or approved peptide drugs — *not* commercial bioregulator complexes like A-5.

If you want, I can help you compare A-5 to **specific, well-studied therapeutic peptides** that *do* have pharmacokinetic and dose-response data — just let me know.
