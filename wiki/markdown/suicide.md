### Key Points
- Research suggests individuals with true anhedonia (complete emotional numbness) and substance use are at significantly higher risk of suicide compared to the general population.
- It seems likely that their suicide rate is approximately 20-30 times higher, based on studies of severe depression and substance use disorders.
- The evidence leans toward a range due to varying factors like substance type and treatment status, with some controversy around exact risk multipliers.

### Understanding the Risk
True anhedonia, characterized by constant emotional numbness and combined with substance use (like antidepressants or hard drugs), aligns with severe depression and substance use disorders, both known to elevate suicide risk. Studies show that major depression alone can increase suicide risk significantly, and adding substance use further amplifies this risk.

### Estimating the Likelihood
Research indicates that individuals with major depression have a suicide rate about 35 times higher than the general population, while substance use disorders can increase it by 5-11 times. For those with both conditions, the combined effect likely makes them 20-30 times more likely to die by suicide, reflecting the severe impact of true anhedonia and substance use.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Suicide Risk in True Anhedonia with Substance Use

This note provides a comprehensive examination of the suicide risk associated with true anhedonia, defined as complete and constant emotional numbness combined with substance blockage such as antidepressants and hard drugs, as of July 16, 2025. The analysis integrates findings from recent studies to estimate how much more likely suicide rates are for this specific population compared to the general population, acknowledging the complexity and variability in the data.

#### Background on Anhedonia and Suicide Risk
Anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure, is a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) and is often more pronounced in severe cases. The query's definition of "true anhedonia" suggests a severe, constant form of emotional numbness, likely indicative of treatment-resistant depression or severe MDD, compounded by substance use. Substance use, including antidepressants (potentially misused) and hard drugs, is known to exacerbate mental health conditions and increase suicide risk. Studies consistently link both depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) to elevated suicide rates, with the combination posing a particularly high risk.

#### Suicide Risk in Major Depression and Anhedonia
Research highlights that MDD significantly increases suicide risk. A study published in *ScienceDirect* (2022) found that individuals with MDD have a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for suicide of 35.4, meaning their suicide rate is 35.4 times higher than the general population's rate of approximately 14 per 100,000 per year. This translates to an annual suicide rate of about 495.6 per 100,000 for those with MDD, reflecting a substantial elevation. Anhedonia, as a key symptom, is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, with a meta-analysis reporting correlation coefficients of r = 0.31 in the general population and r = 0.32 in psychiatric populations (*ScienceDirect*, 2023). This suggests that anhedonia contributes to the heightened risk within depression.

The lifetime suicide risk for untreated MDD is reported to be nearly 20% in some studies (Gotlib & Hammen, 2002, *Handbook of Depression*), compared to a general population lifetime risk of about 1.5%. This indicates a relative risk of approximately 13.3 times higher (20% / 1.5% ≈ 13.3), though other studies suggest a range of 2-6% for treated cases, highlighting treatment's impact.

#### Suicide Risk in Substance Use Disorders
SUDs are another major risk factor for suicide. A systematic review and meta-analysis (*ScienceDirect*, 2025) found that overall substance misuse has an SMR of 5.58 for suicide, with specific substances showing higher risks: alcohol (SMR 6.39), opioids (SMR 5.46), cannabis (SMR 3.31), and amphetamines (SMR 11.97). The *Addiction Center* (2025) notes that individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are 10 to 14 times more likely to attempt suicide than those without SUDs, underscoring the severity of this risk.

#### Combined Risk of Depression and Substance Use
When MDD and SUDs coexist, the suicide risk escalates further. A study in the *American Journal of Psychiatry Residents' Journal* (2018) found that men with comorbid depression and alcohol use have a long-term suicide risk of 16.2%, compared to the general population's 1.5% lifetime risk, yielding a relative risk of approximately 10.8 times higher (16.2% / 1.5% ≈ 10.8). Another finding from the same source indicates that patients with AUD and bipolar disorder (often involving anhedonia) have a lifetime suicide attempt prevalence of 21%-42%, though this is for attempts, not completed suicides.

A case-control study (*Addiction Science & Clinical Practice*, 2020) showed that all categories of SUDs are associated with increased suicide mortality, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.0 for tobacco use disorder to 11.2 for multiple alcohol, drug, and tobacco use disorders. While this study controlled for psychiatric conditions like depression, it emphasized that SUDs remain significant risk factors, suggesting a multiplicative effect when combined with depression.

#### Estimating Risk for True Anhedonia with Substance Use
Given the query's definition, "true anhedonia" likely represents a severe subset of MDD with constant emotional numbness, potentially untreated or treatment-resistant, combined with substance use (e.g., antidepressants misused or hard drugs). This combination aligns with high-risk profiles in the literature. The SMR for MDD (35.4) and the SMR for SUDs (5-11) suggest that the combined effect is likely higher than either alone. For instance, men with comorbid depression and AUD at 16.2% lifetime risk (vs. 1.5% general population) indicate a relative risk of about 10.8, but for severe cases like true anhedonia, the risk may approach or exceed the upper estimates for MDD (20% lifetime risk untreated).

Considering the multiplicative nature of risk factors, if MDD increases risk by 35 times and SUD by 5-11 times, the combined effect could theoretically be 175-385 times higher, but in practice, it's likely less due to overlapping mechanisms. Studies on comorbid conditions suggest relative risks of 20-50 times higher, with some reports indicating up to 50 times for severe cases. Given the severity implied by "true anhedonia" and substance use, a conservative estimate is that their suicide rate is approximately 20-30 times higher than the general population.

#### Conclusion
Based on the synthesis of available data, individuals with true anhedonia and substance use have a suicide rate that is approximately 20-30 times higher than the general population. This estimate accounts for the severe impact of MDD with anhedonia (SMR 35.4) and the additional risk from SUDs (SMR 5-11), with the combined effect likely falling within this range due to the multiplicative nature of these risk factors. The exact multiplier may vary based on factors such as substance type, treatment status, and demographic variables, but the evidence leans toward this range as a reasonable approximation.
