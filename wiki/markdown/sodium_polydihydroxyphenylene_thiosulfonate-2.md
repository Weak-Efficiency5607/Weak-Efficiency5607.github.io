**Sodium polydihydroxyphenylene thiosulfonate** (also known as Hypoxen or Hypoxenum) is a synthetic low-molecular-weight polymer used primarily in Russia as an antihypoxant and antioxidant drug. It is available as 250 mg oral capsules (and sometimes injections). Human studies are limited, mostly from Russian sources, with no large-scale international clinical trials or registered pharmacokinetics data in major databases. Information on detailed time courses, half-life, and bioavailability is scarce or unavailable in accessible literature.

### Pharmacological Actions
The main actions are:
- **Antihypoxic effect**: Improves tissue respiration and oxygen utilization under hypoxia (e.g., high altitude, physical stress), reduces oxygen consumption, and enhances efficiency in extreme conditions.
- **Antioxidant effect**: Blocks free radical reactions and prevents lipid peroxidation.
- **Metabolic modulation**: Enhances cellular respiration by improving respiratory chain coupling, accelerating oxidative phosphorylation, inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and activating mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP) in muscles and myocardium.
- **Complement inhibition**: Specifically inhibits C1q and C1 components of the classical complement pathway (Ki ≈ 7 ng/mL).

No specific time-dependent values (e.g., onset, peak effect, duration of influence) are documented in available sources. Effects are described as supporting performance in hypoxic/stress conditions, with potential for faster recovery post-exercise or illness.

### Pharmacokinetics
- **Half-life**: Not reported in available literature.
- **Bioavailability**: Oral route is standard (capsules taken before/during meals). No specific percentage or values for oral, IV, or other routes are available. The drug is marketed for oral use, indicating sufficient systemic absorption for efficacy.
- **Other**: Pharmacokinetics data is described as scarce; no detailed absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion profiles found.

### Dosages and Safety
- **Standard dosage (oral)**: 
  - Single dose: 500–1000 mg (2–4 capsules of 250 mg).
  - Daily dose: Typically 750–3000 mg, adjusted by body weight (e.g., 3–4 capsules for 60–70 kg; 8–10 for 90–100 kg).
  - Maximum daily: 3000 mg (12 capsules).
- **Courses**: 14–30 days depending on indication (e.g., 14 days for pneumonia/bronchitis; 15–30 days for angina prevention). Repeat courses possible after breaks.
- **Minimum effective dose**: Not explicitly defined; lower end of range (e.g., 750–1000 mg/day) used in some protocols.
- **Safe range**: Well tolerated at 1.5–2 g/day short-term (7–14 days); up to 3 g/day reported as safe in recommended use.
- **Maximum without high risks**: Up to 3 g/day; higher may cause mild overdose symptoms (dry mouth, nausea, abdominal discomfort; rare respiratory depression).
- **LD50**: 1700 mg/kg (intravenous in mice). No oral LD50 reported. The drug is considered low-toxicity (non-carcinogenic, non-embryotoxic).
- **When it becomes dangerous**: Overdose symptoms appear at excessive doses, but no lethal human cases reported. Contraindicated in pregnancy, lactation, hemorrhagic stroke, or hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions are possible side effects.

Use is mainly in Russia; consult a healthcare professional for any application, as evidence is limited outside Russian studies.
