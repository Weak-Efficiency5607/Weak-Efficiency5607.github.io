The **structure of PRL-8-147** remains unknown, as it was never publicly disclosed, patented individually, or documented beyond private notes and brief abstracts from Dr. Nikolaus Hansl. No reliable sources, including patents, publications, or nootropics communities, provide any confirmed details or even informed speculation on its exact formula.

However, based on Hansl's known work (primarily U.S. Patent 3,870,715 on substituted aminoethyl meta-benzoic acid esters for learning facilitation and spasmolytic effects), PRL-8-147 was likely a close analog or optimized derivative of **PRL-8-53** (methyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate hydrochloride). It was described as more potent in memory enhancement.

Here is a reasoned list of plausible possibilities for what PRL-8-147 could structurally be, all speculative and grounded in variations within Hansl's patented series:

1. **Different ester group** — Instead of the methyl ester in PRL-8-53, it could use an ethyl, propyl, or isopropyl ester (e.g., ethyl 3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate). Longer-chain esters might improve bioavailability or potency, common tweaks in medicinal chemistry for CNS drugs.

2. **Modification to the amine substituent** — The nitrogen could have a different alkyl or aryl group, such as N-ethyl-N-benzyl instead of N-methyl-N-benzyl, or a bulkier substituent like N-benzyl-N-propyl, to enhance dopaminergic or cholinergic modulation while retaining the core scaffold.

3. **Additional substituent on the benzyl ring** — The phenyl ring of the benzyl group could have a halogen (e.g., para-chloro or meta-fluoro), methyl, or methoxy group, altering lipophilicity or receptor binding (similar to how substituents modify amphetamine derivatives).

4. **Change in the ethyl linker** — A minor extension or branching, like a propyl linker or an alpha-methyl on the ethyl chain (e.g., 3-(1-methyl-2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzoate), potentially increasing rigidity or steric effects for better brain penetration.

5. **Shift in benzoic acid substitution position** — While Hansl focused on meta (3-position), it could be an ortho or para variant, though meta was preferred in his work for activity.

6. **Amide instead of ester** — Conversion to an amide (e.g., N-methyl-3-(2-(benzyl(methyl)amino)ethyl)benzamide), as amides often have longer duration or different pharmacokinetic profiles in nootropic design.

7. **Hydroxy or methoxy addition on the chain** — As seen in some patented examples (e.g., 1-methoxy variants), adding a methoxy group on the carbon alpha to the amine for potential prodrug-like properties or altered metabolism.

These are educated guesses based on common structure-activity relationship (SAR) modifications in Hansl's patent class. No evidence supports any specific one, and attempts in nootropics communities to recover the structure (e.g., contacting family or archives) have failed. It remains a "lost" compound in nootropics history.
