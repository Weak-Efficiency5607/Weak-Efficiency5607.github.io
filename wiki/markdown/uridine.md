Yes, uridine is related to the immune system and can play roles in conditions involving immunodeficiency. As a nucleoside and building block of RNA, uridine contributes to cellular energy metabolism and signaling pathways that support immune cell function. For instance, it can serve as an energy source for immune cells, helping to sustain their proliferative and responsive capacities during immune activation. Uridine also modulates overall immune function, potentially enhancing immunity through its involvement in nucleotide synthesis and related biochemical processes.

Regarding immunodeficiency, uridine has been explored in therapeutic contexts for certain disorders. In congenital disorders of glycosylation like PGM3-CDG, which often present with immunodeficiency (e.g., increased infection susceptibility due to impaired immune cell development and function), uridine supplementation is used as a potential treatment to address glycosylation defects and support immune health. Additionally, in the context of HIV/AIDS management, uridine supplements have been studied for mitigating mitochondrial toxicity from antiretroviral drugs, which can indirectly affect immune recovery, though this is more about protecting cellular health rather than directly treating core immunodeficiency.

Beyond these, modifications of uridine (such as pseudouridine or N1-methylpseudouridine) in mRNA vaccines and therapies are designed to evade or modulate innate immune detection, reducing unwanted inflammatory responses while allowing for effective therapeutic delivery. Unmodified uridine in RNA can trigger stronger antiviral and proinflammatory immune responses, which has implications for both immunity and potential immunodeficiencies in synthetic biology applications. However, these relationships are context-dependent, and uridine's effects can vary based on dosage, form, and specific health conditions—consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
