### Pharmacological Actions of Tofisopam
Tofisopam is a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative primarily used as an anxiolytic agent. Unlike classical 1,4-benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), it lacks many typical benzodiazepine effects, making its pharmacological profile unique. Below is a comprehensive list of its known pharmacological actions, based on available data from pharmacological studies, databases, and reviews. For each action, I've included quantitative values where available (e.g., IC50 for inhibition, affinities), as well as details on how the action influences physiological or therapeutic outcomes. Influences are described in terms of onset, duration, and overall effects, tied to pharmacokinetic parameters where relevant (e.g., peak plasma levels at 2 hours post-dose, half-life of 6-8 hours influencing duration of effects). Note that tofisopam does not bind to the GABA receptor's benzodiazepine site, and its effects are largely mediated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition.

- **Anxiolytic (Anti-Anxiety) Action**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: Therapeutic doses of 50-300 mg/day (divided into 3 doses) reduce anxiety symptoms. Peak effect aligns with Tmax (2 hours post-oral dose), with duration tied to half-life (6-8 hours), leading to effects lasting 6-12 hours per dose.
  - **Influence**: Reduces anxiety and tension without causing sedation or cognitive impairment. This makes it suitable for daytime use in anxiety disorders and alcohol withdrawal, improving quality of life by alleviating symptoms like restlessness and irritability. It does not lead to dependence as readily as other benzodiazepines (recommended max use: 12 weeks). In studies, it regulates autonomic function, stabilizing heart rate and blood pressure in stress responses.

- **Enhancement of Anticonvulsant Activity**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: Potentiates effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) but not other anticonvulsants like sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin. No standalone anticonvulsant IC50 available; enhancement observed at therapeutic doses (50-300 mg/day).
  - **Influence**: Increases seizure threshold when combined with certain drugs, potentially useful in epilepsy management. Effects onset within 2 hours, lasting 6-8 hours, but tofisopam alone has no anticonvulsant properties, avoiding risks like over-suppression of neural activity.

- **Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibition**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: Isoenzyme-selective inhibitor with affinities: PDE-4A1 (IC50: 0.42 μM, highest affinity), PDE-10A1 (IC50: 0.92 μM), PDE-3 (IC50: 1.98 μM), PDE-2A3 (IC50: 2.11 μM). Also inhibits cGMP-inhibited PDE-3A (potency unknown).
  - **Influence**: Elevates cyclic nucleotide levels (cAMP/cGMP), modulating intracellular signaling. This contributes to anxiolytic effects by reducing neuroinflammation and improving mood regulation. PDE-10A inhibition may influence schizophrenia symptoms (e.g., via dopamine modulation in striatum), with potential antipsychotic effects. Onset: 2 hours; duration: 6-8 hours. This action differentiates it from GABAergic drugs, reducing side effects like sedation.

- **CYP3A4 Inhibition (Cytochrome P450 3A4)**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: Inhibits CYP3A4, affecting substrates like midazolam (increases midazolam exposure; no exact IC50 provided). Predicted CYP3A4 inhibitor (probability: 0.6101).
  - **Influence**: Alters metabolism of co-administered drugs, potentially increasing their plasma levels and prolonging effects (e.g., enhanced sedation from other benzos). This can lead to drug interactions, requiring dose adjustments. Influence peaks at 2 hours, persisting 6-8 hours, with clinical significance unclear but potentially hazardous in polypharmacy.

- **Cognitive Improvement**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: At 50 mg/kg (animal studies), improves cognitive performance for 7 days; enhances synaptic function (no human IC50).
  - **Influence**: Restores impaired cognition (e.g., in models of neurodegeneration), potentially via PDE inhibition. Unlike amnestic benzos, it avoids memory impairment. Effects build over days, with daily dosing sustaining benefits for anxiety-related cognitive deficits.

- **Antidepressive Action**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: Classified as an antidepressive agent (MeSH); effective in anxiety with comorbid depression at 50-300 mg/day.
  - **Influence**: Alleviates fatigue and depressive symptoms associated with anxiety, improving mood without sedative burden. Onset: 2 hours; duration: 6-8 hours per dose.

- **Autonomic Regulation**:
  - **Quantitative Values**: No specific IC50; observed at therapeutic doses.
  - **Influence**: Stabilizes autonomic nervous system, reducing symptoms like palpitations in anxiety. Paradoxical excitation possible (e.g., excitement, delirium), but rare.

- **Other Minor Actions**:
  - No sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, amnestic, or motor-impairing effects (unlike 1,4-benzodiazepines).
  - Potential for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment via D-enantiomer (dextofisopam), with moderate efficacy in trials.
  - Predicted hERG inhibition: Weak (predictor I: 0.989; predictor II: non-inhibitor 0.8089), low cardiac risk.

These actions are influenced by pharmacokinetics: Rapid absorption (Tmax 2 hours) leads to quick onset, while hepatic metabolism and 6-8 hour half-life allow for thrice-daily dosing without accumulation in short-term use.

### Half-Life
- Elimination half-life: 6-8 hours (primary value from multiple sources; one source lists 3 hours, but 6-8 hours is more consistently reported).

### Bioavailabilities
- **Oral Bioavailability**: Predicted as high (probability 1.0 based on computational models; no exact percentage available, but oral is the primary route with good absorption, reaching peak levels in 2 hours). No data on absolute bioavailability, but human intestinal absorption predicted as high (probability 1.0).
- No data on other routes (e.g., IV, IM); tofisopam is primarily administered orally, with no significant differences reported for formulations.

### Dosages
- **Standard Therapeutic Dosage**: 50-300 mg/day, divided into 3 doses (e.g., 50-100 mg three times daily) for anxiety and alcohol withdrawal.
- **Minimum Effective Dosage**: Approximately 50 mg/day (lowest recommended starting dose; effective for mild anxiety).
- **Safe Range**: 50-300 mg/day (prescription guideline; maximum 12 weeks to minimize dependence risk).
- **Maximum Without High Risks**: 300 mg/day (upper limit of recommended range; exceeding this increases risk of paradoxical effects like excitation or interactions, but therapeutic index is high).
- **When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous**: Doses exceeding 300 mg/day or chronic use beyond 12 weeks increase risks of dependence, withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, seizures), and interactions. Overdose symptoms (somnolence, coma) typically start at very large ingestions (e.g., >10x therapeutic dose), but deaths are rare alone due to high safety margin. Danger escalates with co-ingestion of CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol), leading to respiratory depression. Elderly/children are more susceptible at lower multiples (e.g., 2-5x dose).

### Toxicity and LD50
- **LD50 Values** (from animal studies):
  - Oral (rat): 825 mg/kg.
  - Intraperitoneal (rat): 1270 mg/kg.
  - Subcutaneous (rat): >10,000 mg/kg.
  - Intravenous (rat): 103 mg/kg.
  - Predicted rat acute toxicity: 2.6346 mol/kg (computational).
- **General Toxicity Profile**: High therapeutic index; low mortality alone. Overdose causes rapid somnolence (onset faster with larger doses), progressing to Grade I/II coma. Rare respiratory depression or death without co-ingestants. Predicted non-carcinogenic (0.7679 probability), non-AMES toxic (0.6138), not readily biodegradable. GHS: Harmful if swallowed (H302); very toxic to aquatic life (H400). No human LD50 available, but extrapolated safety suggests doses >1 g could be dangerous in humans, with symptoms like ataxia, hypothermia, and amnesia.
