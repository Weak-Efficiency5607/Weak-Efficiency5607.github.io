Oral NMN supplementation has been shown in various animal studies to influence gene expression and metabolic pathways, leading to both downregulations and upregulations that contribute to its anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic benefits. These effects are often mediated through increased NAD+ levels, activation of sirtuins (e.g., SIRT1), and modulation of mitochondrial function. Note that most evidence comes from preclinical models (e.g., mice), with limited human data, and results can vary by tissue, dosage, and context (e.g., aging, obesity, or disease models). Below is a summary of key examples:

### Downregulations
- **Inflammatory pathways and cytokines**: NMN reduces expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and chemokine genes (e.g., Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl1). It also downregulates NF-κB signaling and blunts age-associated inflammation in adipose tissue, liver, and lungs. This anti-inflammatory effect extends to depressing circulating inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating fibrosis in models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
- **Age-associated gene changes**: NMN prevents or reverses many age-induced transcriptional alterations in tissues like skeletal muscle (up to 76% of changed genes), white adipose tissue (73%), and liver (42%). This includes downregulation of pathways related to immune activation, cytokine activity, and oxidative stress.
- **Lipid metabolism and fibrosis genes**: In obesity and NAFLD models, NMN downregulates profibrogenic genes, reduces hepatic steatosis, and alters pathways like arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism by promoting their catabolism via CYP450 enzymes.
- **Oxidative stress and ROS-related pathways**: NMN decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative degradation, partly by stabilizing enzymes like glutathione peroxidase 4 and reducing ferroptosis susceptibility.
- **Energy metabolism pathways**: Related NAD+ precursors like nicotinamide riboside (NR) downregulate energy metabolism and mitochondrial pathways in skeletal muscle, suggesting a similar potential for NMN to modulate these for efficiency.

### Upregulations
- **Mitochondrial and metabolic genes**: NMN enhances expression of mitochondrially encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes via the SIRT1-HIF-1α-c-Myc pathway, improves mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., through microRNA changes), and upregulates pathways like TCA cycle activity and ATP production. It also boosts mitonuclear protein balance and antioxidant responses (e.g., via DRP1 for morphology).
- **Anti-aging and longevity genes**: NMN restores or upregulates genes linked to circadian rhythm, insulin sensitivity, and longevity pathways (e.g., Rb1cc1 in longevity regulation and Vav2 in cAMP signaling).
- **Angiogenic and protective pathways**: It increases pro-angiogenic gene expression in endothelial cells, enhances cell proliferation, and activates protective pathways like SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 for cell viability and tight junctions.
- **Reproductive and tissue-specific genes**: In models of obesity or damage, NMN upregulates genes like Ddx4, Esr, Ar, and Junb for spermatogenesis, and improves lipid metabolism genes.

Regarding nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), as noted previously, NMN does not typically downregulate it; some studies show upregulation or restoration in stress conditions, with no significant changes in others. Overall, these modulations are tissue-specific and often counteract age- or disease-related dysregulation rather than causing broad suppression or activation. Human trials are ongoing, but safety appears high at typical doses (e.g., up to 1g/day).
