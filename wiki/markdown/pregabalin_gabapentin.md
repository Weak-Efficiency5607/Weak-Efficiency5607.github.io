The claim that pregabalin and gabapentin open Kv7 channels (also known as KCNQ channels) is partially accurate but requires nuance based on available scientific evidence. Gabapentin has been shown to directly activate certain Kv7 channels, contributing to its mechanism of reducing neuronal excitability. However, pregabalin does not directly activate these channels, though some studies suggest it may potentiate their function or interact synergistically with Kv7 openers in pain models. Both drugs are gabapentinoids primarily acting on the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, but their effects on Kv7 differ.

### Key Findings on Gabapentin
- Gabapentin potently activates homomeric KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 channels, as well as heteromeric KCNQ2/3 channels (the molecular basis of the neuronal M-current).
- This activation enhances potassium currents, hyperpolarizes neurons, and reduces excitability, which may underlie its analgesic and anticonvulsant effects beyond calcium channel modulation.
- Studies indicate gabapentin interferes with other Kv7 activators like retigabine, confirming its direct binding and activation.

### Key Findings on Pregabalin
- Pregabalin does not activate KCNQ2/3, KCNQ3, or KCNQ5 channels and may even inhibit them at high concentrations (≥10 µM).
- Its primary mechanism is binding to α2δ subunits of calcium channels, reducing neurotransmitter release (e.g., glutamate, norepinephrine).
- Some research shows pregabalin synergizes with Kv7 openers (e.g., flupirtine, retigabine) in pain models, with effects attenuated by Kv7 blockers like XE991, suggesting indirect involvement or potentiation of Kv7 function.
- No direct activation is reported; any Kv7-related effects appear secondary or context-dependent.

### Summary Table of Evidence

| Drug       | Direct Activation of Kv7 Channels? | Key Evidence/Notes |
|------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Gabapentin | Yes (potent activator of KCNQ3, KCNQ5, KCNQ2/3) | Enhances K+ currents; reduces excitability; interferes with other activators. |
| Pregabalin | No (no activation; possible inhibition at high doses) | Synergizes with openers; effects blocked by Kv7 inhibitors; may potentiate function indirectly. |

These conclusions are based on pharmacological studies, including electrophysiology in cell models and in vivo pain models in mice. Differences between the drugs may explain varying clinical efficacies, though both are used for similar indications like neuropathic pain. Further research is needed to clarify indirect interactions.
