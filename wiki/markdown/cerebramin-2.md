Cerebramin is a natural peptide bioregulator derived from bovine (calf) brain tissue, part of the cytamin class of supplements. It is marketed as a product to support brain function and is available in oral tablet form (typically 155 mg per tablet). Detailed scientific data on pharmacokinetics, half-life, bioavailability, LD50, and toxicity is limited or not publicly available in peer-reviewed sources, as it is primarily a supplement rather than a regulated pharmaceutical in many jurisdictions. The information below is compiled from product descriptions and manufacturer claims. No clinical trials or pharmacological studies were found providing quantitative values for onset, duration, peak effects, or specific influence timelines for each action. Claims are based on general descriptions of peptide bioregulators, which are said to selectively target and normalize brain cell function.

### Pharmacological Actions
Cerebramin is described as acting on brain cells to restore and protect the nervous system. Specific actions include:
- **Improvement of memory capacity**: Enhances recall and retention, potentially influencing cognitive performance by normalizing neuronal metabolism.
- **Enhancement of attention span and focus**: Increases ability to concentrate, which may influence productivity and learning by reducing mental fatigue.
- **Support for learning new skills**: Facilitates acquisition of information, influencing cognitive adaptability by optimizing brain cell activity.
- **Restoration of brain functions post-injury**: Aids recovery after stroke or traumatic brain injury, influencing neurological repair by promoting peptide-based cellular normalization.
- **Reduction of irritation and apathy**: Decreases emotional instability and lethargy, influencing mood and motivation by balancing nervous system activity.
- **Protection against neurodegenerative conditions**: May help in conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by supporting brain tissue integrity and reducing oxidative stress.
- **Support for mental development**: Recommended for delayed mental or speech development in children, influencing developmental processes by stimulating brain cell function.
- **Alleviation of depression and asthenia**: Improves overall mental state, influencing energy levels and emotional well-being.

No specific "values for each of time" (e.g., onset, peak, or duration of influence) are available. Manufacturer claims suggest effects build over the course of treatment (10-14 days), with improvements in memory, focus, and mood potentially noticeable within days to weeks, depending on individual factors like age, condition, and severity. Long-term influence may require repeated courses. These actions are attributed to the peptides selectively interacting with brain cells to regulate metabolism, without hormone-like effects.

### Half-Life
No data available on half-life. As an oral peptide supplement, it is likely short due to gastrointestinal breakdown, but no quantitative information exists.

### Bioavailabilities
No specific bioavailability data is available. It is administered orally, so bioavailability depends on gastrointestinal absorption. Peptides in cytamins are claimed to be bioavailable due to low molecular weight and natural origin, but no percentages or comparisons (e.g., vs. IV or other routes) are provided. Oral route is the primary administration method; no data on other routes.

### Dosages
- **Recommended dosage**: 1-3 tablets (155-465 mg total) 2-3 times per day, taken 10-15 minutes before meals with water (do not chew). Course duration: 10-14 days.
- **Safe range**: The recommended dosage is considered safe for adults and children (adjusted by age/condition). Repeat courses after a 3-6 month break.
- **Minimum effective dosage**: Not explicitly stated, but starting at 1 tablet 2 times per day (310 mg total daily) is implied for mild cases or maintenance.
- **Maximum without high risks**: Up to 3 tablets 3 times per day (1,395 mg total daily) for 10-14 days, as per recommendations. No high-risk threshold is specified beyond this, but exceeding may increase potential for mild side effects.
- **LD50**: No data available. As a natural peptide extract, it is positioned as low-toxicity, with no reported lethal doses in animals or humans.
- **When it starts to become too dangerous**: No specific threshold. Overdose risks are not documented, but excessive intake could theoretically cause gastrointestinal discomfort or allergic reactions. It is contraindicated in cases of individual intolerance or allergy to components. Considered safe at recommended doses, with no known severe toxicity even in long-term use.

### Side Effects and Safety
- Generally described as safe and well-tolerated, with no reported side effects in product information.
- Potential risks: Mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching) due to bovine origin. Not recommended during pregnancy, lactation, or in children under supervision without medical advice.
- No interactions with other drugs mentioned, but consult a physician for concurrent use.
- Overall, marketed as non-toxic with a high safety profile, similar to other cytamins.

For medical use, consult a healthcare professional, as efficacy and safety may vary. No FDA approval or equivalent for therapeutic claims in many countries; it is often sold as a dietary supplement.
