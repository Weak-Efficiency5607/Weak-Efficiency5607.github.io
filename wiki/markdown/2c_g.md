### Key Points
- Research suggests 2C-G is a psychedelic with effects likely due to serotonin receptor activity, especially at 5-HT2A, but exact mechanisms are not fully studied.
- The evidence leans toward a dosage range of 20-35 mg, with 20 mg as the minimum effective dose, and higher doses potentially increasing risks, though specific safe maximums are unclear.
- It seems likely that 2C-G has a long duration of 18-30 hours, suggesting a prolonged half-life, but exact half-life data is unavailable.
- Oral bioavailability appears good, as it's effective orally, but specific values are not known.
- Adverse effects at high doses may include hallucinations and increased heart rate, similar to related compounds, but overdose data for 2C-G is scarce.

### Dosage and Safety
**Dosage Range:**  
The typical dosage for 2C-G is 20-35 mg, with 20 mg considered the minimum effective dose based on user reports. Doses above 35 mg may increase the risk of adverse effects, but specific thresholds for high risks are not well-established due to limited research.

**Safe Range and Maximum Dose:**  
While 20-35 mg is commonly reported, exceeding this may lead to intensified effects like hallucinations and physical symptoms, but a precise maximum without high risks is unclear. Users should start low and go slow, especially given the long duration.

**LD50 and Danger Threshold:**  
There is no available data on the LD50 for 2C-G in humans or animals, and reports of overdoses are scarce. It seems likely that, like other psychedelics, the LD50 is much higher than recreational doses, but caution is advised at higher doses due to potential for severe reactions.

### Pharmacokinetics
**Half-Life:**  
Specific half-life data for 2C-G is not available, but its long duration of 18-30 hours suggests a prolonged half-life compared to related compounds like 2C-B, which has a half-life of about 2.48 hours in oral fluid.

**Bioavailability:**  
2C-G is effective when taken orally, indicating good oral bioavailability, but exact values are not documented. Other routes, like insufflation, are less common and not well-studied for 2C-G.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of 2C-G Pharmacological Actions and Related Parameters

This survey note provides a detailed examination of 2C-G (CAS 207740-18-9), a psychedelic phenethylamine, focusing on its pharmacological actions, dosage, half-life, bioavailability, and safety profile. The information is derived from available literature, including Alexander Shulgin's "PiHKAL," scientific reviews, and related studies on the 2C family, acknowledging the limited specific data for 2C-G itself.

#### Pharmacological Actions
2C-G, chemically known as 3,4-dimethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is part of the 2C series of psychedelics, first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. Research suggests its primary pharmacological action is as a serotonin receptor agonist, particularly at the 5-HT2A receptor, which is consistent with other 2C compounds and likely responsible for its hallucinogenic and psychedelic effects. Shulgin described it as an "insight-enhancer" with effects similar to 2C-D and Ganesha, noting minimal visual impact but strong energy and long duration, indicating a focus on introspective rather than sensory effects.

The evidence leans toward 2C-G sharing metabolic pathways with other 2C drugs, involving O-demethylation at positions 2 and 5, followed by deamination and oxidation, primarily mediated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and MAO-B enzymes. This metabolism suggests potential interactions with MAO inhibitors, increasing serum concentrations and toxicity risks, though specific studies on 2C-G are lacking.

#### Dosage and Safety
The dosage range for 2C-G, as reported in "PiHKAL," is 20-35 mg, with qualitative comments at 22 mg indicating functional effects and mental enhancement to a ++ level, and at 32 mg described as "superb" and a "true psychedelic," suggesting 20 mg as the minimum effective dose. The long duration of 18-30 hours, compared to other 2C compounds like 2C-B (4-8 hours), indicates a need for caution with dosing due to prolonged exposure.

**Safe Range and Maximum Dose Without High Risks:**  
While 20-35 mg is the typical range, Shulgin's testing up to 32 mg did not report severe adverse effects, but doses above 35 mg may increase risks, inferred from related 2C compounds where doses over 30-40 mg can cause frightening hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. Specific maximum doses without high risks are unclear due to limited data, and users are advised to start low and go slow, especially given the long duration.

**LD50 and Danger Threshold:**  
There is no available data on the LD50 for 2C-G in humans or animals, and reports of overdoses are scarce. For comparison, other psychedelics like LSD have very high LD50s compared to effective doses, suggesting 2C-G likely follows suit, but caution is advised at higher doses due to potential for severe reactions, with no clear threshold for when it becomes too dangerous.

#### Half-Life and Bioavailability
Specific pharmacokinetic data for 2C-G, including half-life and bioavailability, is not available in the literature. However, its duration of 18-30 hours suggests a prolonged half-life compared to 2C-B, which has an elimination half-life of about 2.48 hours in oral fluid, indicating 2C-G may have a significantly longer presence in the body. This long duration could imply slower metabolism, possibly due to its unique structure with methyl groups at positions 3 and 4.

Oral bioavailability appears good, as 2C-G is effective when taken orally, with no reports of alternative routes like insufflation being common. For comparison, other 2C compounds are known to have effective oral administration, but exact bioavailability percentages are not documented, limiting precise quantification.

#### Adverse Effects and Risks
Adverse effects for 2C-G at higher doses are inferred from related compounds, potentially including hallucinations, agitation, aggression, hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, as seen in 2C-B at doses over 30-40 mg. Shulgin's reports at 32 mg noted non-physical heat and tummy queasiness, suggesting gastrointestinal discomfort at higher doses. The risk of adverse effects increases with higher doses, and combining with other substances or in individuals with pre-existing conditions may exacerbate these risks, though specific overdose cases for 2C-G are not documented.
