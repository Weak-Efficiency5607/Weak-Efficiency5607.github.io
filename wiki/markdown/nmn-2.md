# NAD⁺ Biosynthesis and Consumption Enzymes

NMN supplementation broadly alters expression of NAD⁺-related enzymes. For example, in a doxorubicin-induced NAD⁺-deficiency model, DOX downregulated NMNAT1–3 (which convert NMN to NAD⁺) and reduced PARP1, CD38 and SIRT1 expression; NMN (or NAD⁺) treatment restored these genes to normal levels. In contrast, under inflammatory stress, NMN often suppresses NAD⁺-consuming enzymes: in human endothelial cells stimulated with poly(I:C), NMN reversed the poly(I:C)-induced upregulation of IL6 and multiple PARP-family transcripts and specifically downregulated PARP9, PARP12 and PARP14. Similarly, high-dose NMN reduced endothelial SIRT1 and SIRT6 transcripts under immune activation, while it increased SIRT5 expression. Thus, NMN can both **rescue** NAD⁺-biosynthetic enzymes when NAD⁺ is low, and **dampen** inflammatory NAD⁺-consuming pathways when needed. In vivo, NMN likewise affected sirtuins: for instance, septic mice showed hippocampal SIRT1 and PGC-1α mRNA (and protein) depletion after sepsis, which were significantly restored by NMN.

* *NMNATs & NAMPT:* NMN replenishment reversed DOX-induced downregulation of NMNAT1–3 (with no change in NAMPT).

* *PARPs/CD38/SIRTs:* DOX lowered PARP1, CD38, SIRT1 mRNA, all of which were brought back up by NMN. Conversely, NMN **suppressed** poly(I:C)-driven PARP and IL6 expression. Endothelial SIRT1/SIRT6 fell with NMN under poly(I:C), whereas SIRT5 rose. In septic brain, NMN **increased** SIRT1/PGC-1α levels that had been suppressed by sepsis.

* *Feedback control:* Cellular NAD⁺ homeostasis is tightly regulated. The NMN transporter Slc12a8 is **upregulated** by NAD⁺ depletion and **downregulated** when NAD⁺ is high. Thus, chronic NMN (raising NAD⁺) likely suppresses Slc12a8 expression. Likewise, Slc12a8 deficiency forces cells to boost uptake of alternate precursors (e.g. NR). These feedback loops help maintain steady NAD⁺ levels despite NMN supplementation.

# Mitochondrial Function and Gene Expression

NMN profoundly improves mitochondrial health at the transcriptional and protein levels. In brain neurons, an NMN bolus rapidly elevated mitochondrial NAD⁺ pools and activated SIRT3, causing global deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins (including MnSOD/SOD2). This SIRT3-driven deacetylation enhanced SOD2 activity, lowered mitochondrial ROS, and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation (via decreased Drp1 S616 phosphorylation). In aging vasculature, NMN largely reversed age-related mitochondrial gene dysregulation: aged cerebral vessels treated with NMN showed expression of electron-transport-chain (ETC) subunit genes (nuclear and mtDNA-encoded) similar to young mice[\[1\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7206476/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1026%20mitochondrial%20function,Gomes). These transcriptional shifts correlated with restored oxidative phosphorylation and reduced oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Physiologically, NMN protected mitochondria under severe stress: in hemorrhagic shock models, NMN-raised NAD⁺ in liver and kidney, prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, and preserved ATP (especially in kidney). Notably, NMN’s mitochondrial benefits depend on SIRT3 – for example, NMN failed to improve cardiac bioenergetics in SIRT3-knockout mice. Long-term NMN also enhanced muscle mitochondrial capacity: treated old mice showed higher mitochondrial respiration and a higher mitochondrial-to-nuclear protein ratio in skeletal muscle.

* *Protein acetylation and dynamics:* A single NMN dose in young mice drove SIRT3-dependent mitochondrial protein deacetylation and decreased Drp1-mediated fission.

* *ETC gene restoration:* NMN treatment of aged neurovascular tissue restored ETC gene expression to youthful levels[\[1\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7206476/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1026%20mitochondrial%20function,Gomes).

* *Stress resilience:* NMN mitigated shock-induced mitochondrial failure, maintaining ATP and NAD⁺ in vital organs.

* *SIRT3 dependence:* NMN’s cardiac and neuronal benefits require SIRT3; without SIRT3, NMN cannot normalize mitochondrial metabolism.

# Metabolic Regulators and Energy Pathways

NMN engages central metabolic regulators. It often activates SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling: for instance, in septic encephalopathy NMN restored hippocampal PGC-1α (mRNA and protein) alongside SIRT1, reversing their sepsis-induced suppression. This reset diminished stress kinases (phospho-p38 MAPK, NF-κB p65) that were elevated by sepsis. In metabolic stress models, NMN improved insulin signaling: long-term NMN in aging mice enhanced insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential), and NMN improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in older humans. NMN also modulates nutrient-sensing transcription factors: for example, in alcohol-exposed liver, NMN prevented overexpression of the stress-responsive factor ATF3 (Atf3 mRNA) and normalized Erk1/2 MAPK signaling. In dietary obesity, NMN shifted liver metabolism toward lipid utilization: integrated transcriptomics in HFD-fed mice showed NMN (and NR) boosted genes for arachidonic/linoleic acid oxidation (notably CYP450 enzymes) and reduced lipogenesis pathways.

* *SIRT1/PGC-1α axis:* NMN reversed septic reductions in SIRT1 and PGC-1α, dampening NF-κB/p38 signaling.

* *Insulin/glucose:* NMN improved insulin sensitivity and glucose handling in aged/obese models[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential) (and in humans).

* *Stress transcription:* In alcoholic liver injury, NMN blocked ethanol-induced Atf3 upregulation and restored Erk1/2 activity.

* *Lipid metabolism:* In NAFLD models, NMN enhanced genes for fatty-acid catabolism (e.g. CYP enzymes for arachidonic/linoleic acid) and improved steatosis and inflammation.

# Inflammation and Immune Pathways

NMN broadly suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression. In injured or immune-stimulated tissues, NMN downregulated cytokines and chemokines: after spinal cord injury in mice, NMN reduced mRNA of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17A, and chemokines CCL3 and Cxcl10. In vitro, NMN mitigated pathogen-like stimulation: poly(I:C)-activated endothelial cells showed high IL6 and PARP9/12/14 expression, all of which NMN substantially repressed. NMN also curbed NF-κB-driven inflammation: in septic mice, NMN lowered IL-6 levels and normalized NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in the hippocampus. In acute lung or systemic inflammation models, NMN reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g. IL-6, IL-1β) and oxidative stress markers (often via activating SIRT1). Concurrently, NMN upregulated antioxidative pathways: in the DOX liver injury model, NMN restored expression of Nrf2 and downstream NQO1 that had been suppressed by DOX, bolstering the tissue’s redox defenses.

* *Cytokine suppression:* NMN reduced expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and other cytokines in diverse settings.

* *Chemokines:* NMN lowered chemokine mRNAs (e.g. CCL3, Cxcl10) after injury.

* *NF-κB pathway:* NMN decreased NF-κB (p65) activation in sepsis and shock, likely via SIRT1 activation.

* *Antioxidant genes:* NMN upregulated Nrf2-target genes (NQO1) in liver, reversing oxidative stress gene suppression.

# Tissue-Specific and Systemic Effects

The transcriptional impact of NMN is seen across organs. **Brain/Nervous System:** NMN improved neurovascular gene profiles (mitochondrial, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory) in aged mice and reversed cognitive deficits via NAD⁺/SIRT1-mediated pathways. **Muscle:** Chronic NMN in mice strongly preserved a youthful muscle transcriptome; \~76% of genes altered by aging in muscle were normalized by NMN, coinciding with better exercise capacity. **Liver:** NMN protected against various liver insults – for example, in alcoholic liver disease NMN blunted Atf3 and inflammatory signaling, and in fatty liver NMN reprogrammed lipid metabolism genes. **Oocytes:** NMN rejuvenated aging gametes: in senescent porcine oocytes, NMN lowered ROS and upregulated antioxidant mRNAs (SOD1, catalase) while decreasing pro-apoptotic Bax and increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 transcripts[\[3\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291640#:~:text=time%20in%20vitro,genes%20of%20senescent%20oocytes%20treated). **Metabolic Tissues:** In high-fat diet and obesity models, NMN improved systemic metabolism (lipids, glucose) and altered adipose/liver gene networks toward oxidative metabolism[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential). **Humans:** In clinical studies, oral NMN raised blood NAD⁺ and led to modest functional gains (e.g. improved gait speed and muscle strength in older adults, better insulin sensitivity in prediabetic women), consistent with its molecular effects.

# Feedback and Chronic Adaptations

NMN-induced NAD⁺ elevation triggers compensatory feedback. As noted, cells downregulate the NMN importer Slc12a8 when NAD⁺ is abundant. Conversely, prolonged NAD⁺ shortage (e.g. with FK866 or aging) induces Slc12a8 expression. Similarly, if NMN uptake is blocked, cells increase salvage from other precursors: Slc12a8-deficient hepatocytes show enhanced nicotinamide riboside uptake. Long-term NMN also “locks in” youthful transcriptional patterns. In mice given NMN for 12 months, most age-associated transcriptomic changes were **prevented** in muscle, fat and liver[\[4\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=other%20pathophysiologies,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential), and mitochondrial respiratory genes were upregulated in muscle. These durable effects suggest NMN can reset gene expression set-points: for example, chronic NMN suppressed age-related weight gain and insulin resistance[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential) while maintaining youthful gene profiles[\[4\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=other%20pathophysiologies,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential). Importantly, no overt toxicity was seen with long-term NMN[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential), indicating homeostatic adjustments rather than detrimental dysregulation.

**Sources:** Peer-reviewed studies reporting in vivo and in vitro NMN supplementation (mice, rats, cultured cells, and human trials) were used to collate these findings[\[3\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291640#:~:text=time%20in%20vitro,genes%20of%20senescent%20oocytes%20treated)[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068222/#:~:text=NMN%20effectively%20mitigates%20age,the%20preventive%20and%20therapeutic%20potential), ensuring a comprehensive integration of transcriptional and proteomic effects.
