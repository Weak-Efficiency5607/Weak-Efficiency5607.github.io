<li>Serotonin Receptor Agonism (5-HT Receptors):</li>
<ul>
<li>Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, which is primarily responsible for its psychedelic effects. It also binds to other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT6, with Ki values (binding affinities) lower than 10 μM. The 5-HT2A receptor is critical for hallucinogenic effects, while 5-HT1A binding may modulate emotional and sensory effects.</li>
<li>Effects: Produces altered perceptions, euphoria, visual hallucinations (primarily closed-eye visuals), increased sensory awareness, and emotional amplification. The head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents, a behavioral proxy for psychedelic effects, is positively correlated with 5-HT2A receptor affinity and negatively correlated with 5-HT1A affinity.</li>
<li>Timeline:</li>
<ul>
<li>Onset: &lt;15 minutes (oral administration).</li>
<li>Peak: ~30 minutes post-administration.</li>
<li>Duration: 2–4 hours (oral route, based on Shulgin’s reports).</li>
</ul>
<li>Notes: The psychedelic effects are described as primarily physical (e.g., tingling sensations, body high) with fewer visual distortions compared to other psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin.</li>
</ul>
<li>Monoamine Reuptake Inhibition:</li>
<ul>
<li>Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT inhibits the reuptake of dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT), increasing extracellular levels of these neurotransmitters. This contributes to its euphoric and energizing effects.</li>
<li>Effects: Enhanced mood, increased energy, and heightened arousal. User reports describe a “sensual” and “energized” body state.</li>
</ul>
<li>Physiological Effects:</li>
<ul>
<li>Mechanism: Likely mediated by a combination of serotonin receptor activation and monoamine reuptake inhibition, with possible contributions from adrenergic and histamine receptor binding.</li>
<li>Effects:</li>
<ul>
<li>Body High: Described as a sharp, all-encompassing tingling sensation that rises during the onset and peaks at ~30 minutes.</li>
<li>Cardiovascular Effects: Potential for tachycardia and increased blood pressure, as reported with other synthetic tryptamines.</li>
<li>Other Effects: Agitation, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control (making walking difficult) have been reported, particularly at higher doses.</li>
<li>Adverse Effects: Acute delirium and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in rare cases, indicating potential for severe toxicity at high doses or in combination with other substances.</li>
</ul>
<li>Timeline: Onset within 15 minutes, peaking at 30 minutes, and resolving within 2–4 hours for most effects. Severe adverse effects (e.g., delirium) may persist longer in overdose scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-Life:</li>
<ul>
<li>Data Availability: There is no direct data on the half-life of 5-MeO-DALT in humans. Based on its short duration of action (2–4 hours), the elimination half-life is likely on the order of 1–2 hours, similar to other short-acting tryptamines like 5-MeO-DMT (half-life ~1 hour) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Metabolism: 5-MeO-DALT is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) through 6-hydroxylation, O-demethylation, or N-dealkylation, with metabolites conjugated to glucuronide or sulfate. (source <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxytryptamine">1</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxy-n-n-dimethyltryptamine">2</a>)</li>
<li>Estimation: Assuming similar pharmacokinetics to 5-MeO-DMT, the half-life is likely short, with rapid clearance contributing to the brief duration of effects.</li>
</ul>
<li>Bioavailability:</li>
<ul>
<li>Oral Bioavailability: Not explicitly quantified in the literature, but oral administration is effective, suggesting moderate bioavailability. Anecdotal reports indicate that oral doses of 12–25 mg produce effects, while higher oral doses (30–35 mg) of 5-MeO-DMT have low potency due to first-pass metabolism by MAO-A, suggesting 5-MeO-DALT may have better oral bioavailability due to less MAO-A susceptibility. A rough estimate based on related tryptamines (e.g., mitragynine ~21%) suggests oral bioavailability of 20–40%. (source <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/5-methoxytryptamine">1</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028383/">2</a>)</li>
<li>Other Routes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Insufflation (Snorting): Likely higher bioavailability (50–70% estimated, based on 5-MeO-DMT’s intranasal bioavailability), with faster onset (~5–10 minutes). (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Intravenous: Near 100% bioavailability, but no specific data exists for 5-MeO-DALT.</li>
<li>Rectal: Potentially higher than oral (40–60% estimated), with faster onset than oral but slower than insufflation.</li>
<li>Vaporization/Inhalation: High bioavailability (70–90% estimated), with very rapid onset (within minutes). (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Dosage Information</li>
<ul>
<li>Safe Dosage Range:</li>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Effective Dose: 12 mg (oral), based on Shulgin’s reports and anecdotal data. Lower doses (e.g., 4–10 mg) may produce mild effects but are often subthreshold. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source</a>)</li>
<li>Typical Recreational Dose: 12–25 mg (oral), producing moderate psychedelic effects with manageable intensity. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source</a>)</li>
<li>Upper Safe Limit: Up to 25 mg (oral) is generally considered within the safe range for most users, though individual sensitivity varies. Doses up to 50 mg have been reported anecdotally but are associated with increased risk of adverse effects (e.g., agitation, loss of motor control). (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks:</li>
<ul>
<li>Threshold for Increased Risk: Doses above 25 mg (oral) increase the risk of adverse effects such as agitation, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control. Doses approaching 50 mg are considered high-risk due to potential for delirium and rhabdomyolysis. (<a href="https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/V25VK0QTAA">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
<li>Context: A reported death involved a user under the influence of 5-MeO-DALT who was hit by a vehicle, suggesting impaired judgment and motor control at higher doses. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source 1</a> and <a href="https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/publications/the-recreational-tryptamine-5-meo-dalt-nn-diallyl-5-methoxytrypta">source 2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<li>LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%):</li>
<ul>
<li>Data Availability: No specific LD50 values are available for 5-MeO-DALT in humans or animals. For comparison, 5-MeO-DMT has an LD50 in mice ranging from 48–278 mg/kg depending on the route of administration. Assuming similar toxicity, the human LD50 for 5-MeO-DALT (for a 70 kg individual) could be estimated at 3,360–19,460 mg (3.36–19.46 g), but this is highly speculative and not directly applicable. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Dangerous Dose Estimation: Doses above 50 mg (oral) are likely dangerous due to increased risk of severe agitation, hyperthermia, delirium, and rhabdomyolysis. A fatal outcome is more likely from behavioral risks (e.g., accidents due to impaired judgment) than direct pharmacological toxicity, as seen in the reported death case. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584612001248">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<li>When It Becomes Too Dangerous:</li>
<ul>
<li>Threshold: Doses ≥50 mg (oral) or equivalent via other routes (e.g., 20–30 mg insufflated) are considered dangerous due to heightened risk of severe physiological and psychological effects. Combining 5-MeO-DALT with MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., harmaline) significantly increases the risk of serotonin toxicity, even at lower doses, due to potentiation of serotonergic effects. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028383/">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462216/">source 2</a>)</li>
<li>Signs of Danger: Agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, delirium, and loss of motor control indicate overdose. Immediate medical attention is required if these occur. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/n-n-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Additional Notes</li>
<ul>
<li>Limited Data: The pharmacological profile of 5-MeO-DALT is poorly characterized due to limited human studies and sparse toxicology data. Most information comes from anecdotal reports and rodent studies, which may not fully translate to humans. (<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DALT">source 1</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22683457/">source 2</a>)</li>
<li>Harm Reduction: Due to the lack of comprehensive safety data, users should start with low doses (e.g., 10–12 mg oral), avoid combinations with other psychoactive substances (especially MAOIs), and ensure a safe environment. Standard drug tests (e.g., urine EIA) do not detect 5-MeO-DALT, complicating clinical management of toxicity.
