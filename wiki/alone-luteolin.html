<li>Pharmacological Actions and Specific Effects</li>
<li>Luteolin's pharmacological profile is extensive, with effects observed across multiple systems. Below, we detail each action with specific values and mechanisms where available, primarily from preclinical studies, as human clinical data remains limited.</li>
<ul>
<li>Anti-inflammatory: Luteolin suppresses key inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. In animal models, oral administration at doses of 10-50 mg/kg and intraperitoneal doses of 25-100 mg/kg have demonstrated significant reductions in these cytokines, particularly in conditions like sepsis, mastitis, and pancreatitis (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>). For instance, at 50 mg/kg orally, it reduced IL-6 levels in a sepsis model.</li>
<li>Antioxidant: Luteolin acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). It activates the Nrf2/Gpx4 pathway, with studies showing increased SOD levels and reduced ROS fluorescence intensity at doses around 10-20 μM in cell models (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/luteolin">source</a>).</li>
<li>Anticancer: Luteolin exhibits proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects, inhibiting carcinogenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Specific values include an IC50 of 5.9 μM for colon cancer cells and a 24% reduction in liver metastasis in animal models. It affects pathways like K-ras/GSK-3β/NF-κB and upregulates p53 and caspase-3, effective in cancers such as colon, pancreatic, hepatocellular, head and neck, ovarian, mammary, and prostate (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Neuroprotective: Luteolin improves memory and reduces neuroinflammation, particularly in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. It enhances autophagy via TRAF6 and Nrf2 pathways, with doses of 5-10 mg/kg/day in rats showing about 2.8 μM in blood and brain tissues, inhibiting microglia overactivation (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/luteolin">source</a>).</li>
<li>Cardioprotective: It protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury by activating PI3K/Akt and TLR4/NLRP3 pathways, reducing infarct size, and enhancing peroxiredoxin II activity. Doses in animal studies range from 10 to 50 mg/kg, with significant effects on cardiac function (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Antidiabetic: Luteolin reverses glucose intolerance and improves insulin sensitivity via Nrf2 and RIP140/NF-κB pathways, with dietary supplementation at 0.002-0.01% showing benefits in animal models (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Antimicrobial and Antiviral: Luteolin demonstrates antibacterial properties and potential antiviral effects, including against SARS-CoV-2, with proposed mechanisms involving inhibition of viral replication, though specific values are less documented (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/luteolin">source</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>Other actions include hepatoprotective effects, musculoskeletal benefits (increasing bone mineral density), and psychiatric effects (antidepressant at 1-3 mg/kg in animals), as detailed in comprehensive reviews (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-life: Research suggests a half-life of approximately 2-3 hours in humans, based on a crossover study with artichoke leaf extract providing 14.4-35.2 mg luteolin equivalents, reaching peak plasma concentrations of 59.08-156.58 ng/mL within 30-40 minutes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>). Another study in rats reported a half-life of 4.94 ± 1.2 hours, indicating potential species differences.</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Luteolin exhibits low oral bioavailability, with only 17.5% of unchanged luteolin detected in rats due to extensive first-pass metabolism, primarily forming glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In humans, free luteolin is minimally detected in plasma, requiring enzymatic hydrolysis for measurement, suggesting systemic bioavailability is limited (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8478534/">source</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage Considerations</li>
<li>Dosage varies by study and condition, with human clinical trials providing the most relevant data:</li>
<ul>
<li>Human Studies: In an autism spectrum disorder trial, a formulation with 100 mg luteolin per capsule was dosed at 1 capsule per 10 kg body weight per day, translating to 300-500 mg/day for children weighing 30-50 kg, with no significant adverse effects reported over 26 weeks (<a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Pharmaceutical_medicine/Luteolin/">source&gt;</a>).</li>
<li>Animal Studies: Effective doses range from 10 to 200 mg/kg, with anti-inflammatory effects at 10-50 mg/kg orally and anticancer effects at similar ranges. The LD50 in rats is above 5000 mg/kg, determined via modified Lorke’s method, with no deaths at doses up to 5000 mg/kg, classifying it as practically non-toxic (<a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/evaluation-of-the-effect-of-luteolin-on-the-hepatic-and-hematopoietic-systems-in-albino-rats-53282.html">source</a>).</li>
<li>Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range in humans appears to be 100-500 mg/day based on clinical trials, with the minimum effective dose likely condition-specific, potentially starting at 100 mg/day for anti-inflammatory effects. Higher doses may be explored, but data is limited.</li>
<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Given the LD50 in rats and lack of toxicity at 500 mg/day in children, it seems likely that doses up to 1000 mg/day could be tolerated, but this requires further human studies. Supplements often recommend 500-1000 mg/day, as seen in commercial products (<a href="https://www.drkarafitzgerald.com/luteolin/">source</a>).</li>
<li>LD50 and Danger Threshold: The LD50 in rats is &gt;5000 mg/kg, suggesting a high safety margin. For a 70 kg human, this would equate to over 350,000 mg, far exceeding typical doses. The threshold for danger is unclear in humans, but chronic high doses (e.g., 200 mg/kg in rats) showed increased liver enzyme activity, suggesting potential hepatotoxicity at very high levels (<a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440%2824%2902732-4">source</a>).</li>
