<li>Oxiracetam is generally considered safe at doses up to 2,400 mg, with few side effects reported.</li>
<li>It enhances the release and uptake of acetylcholine.</li>
<li>While its primary effects are on acetylcholine and glutamate, there is some indication it may influence dopamine and serotonin to a lesser extent.</li>
<li>Oxiracetam exhibits neuroprotective effects, protecting neurons from oxidative stress and excitotoxicity.</li>
<li>Studies in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion show it decreases neuronal degeneration and white matter lesions, particularly at doses of 100-200 mg/kg, with significant reductions in the hippocampus and cortex.</li>
<li>Inhibits astrocyte activation.</li>
<li>Increases cerebral blood flow.</li>
<li>In animal studies, doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg significantly increased cerebral blood flow, with statistical significance (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively).</li>
<li>Increases ATP synthesis.</li>
<li>In the acute phase post-cerebral hypoperfusion, it decreases abnormal accumulation of glucose and citric acid while increasing levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, and GMP in the cortex.</li>
<li>enhances antioxidant levels, such as glutathione and ascorbic acid, with significant increases observed (P &lt; 0.01 for glutathione, P &lt; 0.001 for ascorbic acid with (S)-oxiracetam).</li>
<li>When administered systemically to rats at 200 mg/kg orally or 100 mg/kg intra-arterially, it is found unmetabolized, with the highest amounts in the septum, followed by the hippocampus, and smaller amounts in the cerebral cortex and striatum. Its distribution pattern is similar when administered directly into the lateral ventricles, indicating its tropism is independent of the administration route.</li>
<li>Estimated brain amounts range from 1.9 to 19 nmols/rat, delivered via cannula in conscious, freely moving rats, highlighting its effective brain penetration.</li>
<li>Oxiracetam demonstrates specific therapeutic effects, such as dose-dependently antagonizing scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats, which is indicative of its ability to counteract cholinergic deficits.</li>
<li>The (S)-enantiomer is identified as the active ingredient, showing higher absorption rates and slower elimination compared to the racemic mixture, and it induces long-term synaptic potentiation in rat hippocampal slices, further supporting its cognitive-enhancing potential.</li>
<li>Oxiracetam is generally considered safe, with studies reporting no significant side effects at single and repeated oral dosages up to 2,400 mg.</li>
