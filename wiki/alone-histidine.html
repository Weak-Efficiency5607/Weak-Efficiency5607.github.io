<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Amino_Acid_Histidine.png/250px-Amino_Acid_Histidine.png"/></li>
<li><b>Precursor to Histamine:</b> Histidine turns into histamine, a chemical that helps with immune responses (like allergies), stomach acid production, and brain functions like wakefulness.</li>
<li><b>Metal Ion Chelation:</b> Histidine can bind to metals like iron and copper, which is important for enzyme activity and protecting against metal-related damage.</li>
<li><b>Antioxidant Activity:</b> It fights off harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage, especially through a derivative called carnosine.</li>
<li><b>Part of Active Peptides:</b> Histidine is found in peptides like carnosine, which help with muscle pH balance and have antioxidant effects.</li>
<li>Research suggests Histidine might help with conditions like metabolic syndrome, heart diseases, and inflammation, but these areas are still being studied, so we don’t have definitive answers yet.</li>
<li>An unexpected detail is that it’s used in solutions for organ preservation, which is not something most people associate with amino acids.</li>
<li>Histidine (HIS) is one of the nine essential amino acids that humans must obtain from their diet, found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and beans. Its unique imidazole side chain, with pKa values around physiological pH, gives it distinctive chemical properties, making it a versatile player in biological systems.</li>
<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<ul>
<li>Precursor to Histamine</li>
<ul>
<li>Histidine is decarboxylated by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase to form histamine, a critical mediator in multiple systems.</li>
<li><b>Immune Response:</b> Histamine is involved in allergic reactions, released from basophils and mast cells, causing symptoms like itching, swelling, and increased vascular permeability. It is treatable with antihistamines for conditions such as urticaria, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, and in severe cases like anaphylaxis, epinephrine is used.</li>
<li><b>Gastric Acid Secretion:</b> Histamine binds to H2 receptors on parietal cells, triggering hydrochloric acid release via proton pump activation, essential for digestion.</li>
<li><b>Neurotransmission:</b> In the brain, histamine modulates appetite, wakefulness, and emotions, with dysregulation linked to conditions like Tourette Syndrome, where mutations in the histidine decarboxylase gene and H3 receptor activity are implicated.</li>
<li>No reported allergic reactions or peptic ulcers have been associated with increased Histidine intake, suggesting safety in typical supplementation.</li>
</ul>
<li>Precursor to Histamine</li>
<ul>
<li>The imidazole ring of Histidine, with pKa values of 6.2 and 6.5 for free L-HIS, 7.0 in carnosine, and 7.1 in anserine, acts as an effective pH buffer near physiological conditions.</li>
<li>This property is clinically utilized in organ preservation solutions, such as the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution, containing 198 mM Histidine, and in myocardial protection during cardiac surgery, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular pH during stress.</li>
</ul>
<li>Metal Ion Chelation</li>
<ul>
<li>Histidine forms complexes with metal ions such as Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺, binding iron in haemoglobin and myoglobin, and is present in metalloenzymes like carbonic anhydrase and cytochromes.</li>
<li>This chelation is crucial for enzyme function and protects against metal-induced neurotoxicity, with carnosine (CAR) specifically noted for protecting against copper- and zinc-induced damage.</li>
</ul>
<li>Antioxidant Activity</li>
<ul>
<li>Histidine mediates antioxidant effects through metal chelation, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and sequestering advanced glycation end products (AGE) and lipoxidation end products (ALE).</li>
<li>Carnosine is particularly effective, more so than free Histidine, in combating oxidative stress, with studies showing protective roles in conditions like chronic kidney disease and diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<li>Component of Biologically Active Peptides</li>
<ul>
<li>Histidine is integral to histidine-rich proteins (e.g., haemoproteins, histatins, histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, filaggrin) and dipeptides like carnosine and homocarnosine.</li>
<li>These peptides have specific functions: carnosine maintains pH buffering in muscle tissue, combating intramuscular acidosis, and exhibits antibacterial activity, while histatins contribute to immunity.</li>
</ul>
<li>Therapeutic Potential and Clinical Studies</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Metabolic Syndrome and Inflammation:</b> A 2013 study improved insulin resistance in obese women with metabolic syndrome by suppressing inflammation. Another 2014 study alleviated inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet-induced obese rats via NF-κB- and PPARγ-involved pathways.</li>
<li><b>Cardiovascular Protection:</b> Histidine prevented brain infarction in postischemic rats (2005 study) and, in combination with vitamin C, protected against isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction in rats (2016). It also mitigated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats when combined with N-acetylcysteine (2014).</li>
<li><b>Diabetes and Oxidative Stress:</b> A 2005 study delayed diabetic deterioration in mice and protected human low-density lipoprotein against oxidation and glycation, while a 2018 study highlighted its protective role against oxidative stress in anemia of chronic kidney disease.</li>
<li><b>Inflammatory Bowel Disease:</b> A 2009 study ameliorated murine colitis by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.</li>
</ul>
<li><h2>Safety and Dosing</h2></li>
<ul>
<li>Histidine supplements are considered possibly safe when taken short-term, up to 4 grams daily for up to 12 weeks, and are well-tolerated. Precautions include avoiding use in folic acid deficiency due to potential formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU) buildup, and insufficient reliable information exists for safety in larger amounts during pregnancy or breastfeeding, recommending sticking to dietary amounts.</li>
