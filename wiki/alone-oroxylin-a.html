<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>Oroxylin A exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, which have been extensively studied in preclinical models. These include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Anti-cancer Effects: Oroxylin A inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by modulating pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB. It has shown potential against various cancers, including brain, breast, and lung cancer, by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. Specific studies, such as those cited in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/oroxylin-a">Pharmacological and Toxicological Properties of Oroxylin A</a>, highlight its role in reversing chemotherapy resistance in leukemia through STAT3 inhibition.</li>
<li>Anti-inflammatory Properties: It reduces inflammation by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, and signaling molecules such as MMPs and VEGF. Research, including <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9496116/">Oroxylin A: A Promising Flavonoid for Chronic Diseases</a>, indicates its modulation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are pivotal in inflammatory responses.</li>
<li>Neuroprotective Effects: Oroxylin A enhances memory and cognitive function, potentially through increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, as noted in studies like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18620712/">The Effects of Oroxylin A on Memory Impairment in Mice</a>. It has been shown to ameliorate memory deficits in models of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative disorder treatment.</li>
<li>Anti-viral Activity: It demonstrates antiviral effects, particularly against influenza A virus, with dose-dependent inhibition rates reported in cell studies, as seen in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332217340465">Oroxylin A Suppresses Influenza A Virus Replication</a>.</li>
<li>Other Actions: Additional benefits include anti-bacterial, anti-thrombotic, and potential cardiovascular and neurological protective effects, supported by reviews like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306334653_Overview_of_Oroxylin_A_A_Promising_Flavonoid_Compound">Overview of Oroxylin A as a Flavonoid Compound</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetic data for Oroxylin A is primarily derived from animal studies, particularly in rats, with the following insights:</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-life: Exact half-life values are not explicitly stated in the literature reviewed. However, studies indicate rapid elimination following intravenous administration (2 mg/kg), suggesting a short half-life, though precise numerical data is lacking. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927013/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, with relative bioavailability less than 2% for intragastric doses of 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg in rats, as detailed in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0367326X19323743">Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution Study</a>. This low bioavailability may limit its oral therapeutic potential, necessitating alternative delivery methods.</li>
<li>Distribution: Following oral administration, Oroxylin A and its metabolites (Oroxylin A 7-O-glucuronide and Oroxylin A sodium sulfonate) show rapid and widespread tissue distribution, with high concentrations in the liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine. This distribution pattern is consistent across studies, indicating systemic exposure. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927013/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Excretion: Excretion profiles vary, with Oroxylin A primarily excreted via feces, Oroxylin A 7-O-glucuronide via bile and urine, and Oroxylin A sodium sulfonate showing minimal excretion, as noted in the same study.</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage and Safety</li>
<li>Dosage information is predominantly from animal models, with limited human data due to the absence of clinical trials:</li>
<ul>
<li>Animal Studies: In mice, a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg has been effective in reversing memory impairments, as seen in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18620712/">Memory Impairment Study in Mice</a>. Higher doses, up to 200 mg/kg orally, showed no toxicity in immunodeficient mice, suggesting a relatively wide safety margin in preclinical settings. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/oroxylin-a">source</a>)</li>
<li>Human Dosage: There is no established safe range, minimum effective dose, or maximum safe dose for humans. The lack of clinical trials means that LD50 (lethal dose 50%) and thresholds for danger are not determined. Reviews like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9496116/">Oroxylin A for Chronic Diseases</a> highlight the need for dose standardization and toxicity assessments in humans, currently unknown.</li>
<li>Safety and Toxicity: Preclinical studies suggest low toxicity, particularly in cancer research, with no significant adverse effects reported at tested doses in animals. However, the translation to humans remains uncertain, and milder side effects may not be captured in rodent models, as noted in <a href="https://www.vagarights.com/oroxylin-a/">Oroxylin A Benefits and Side Effects</a>.</li>
