<li>Functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds:</li>
<ul>
<li>Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase.</li>
<li>Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes.</li>
<li>Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids.</li>
<li>Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan.</li>
</ul>
<li>Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).</li>
<li>Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs.</li>
