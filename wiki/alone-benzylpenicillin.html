<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>The primary pharmacological action of benzylpenicillin is its bactericidal effect, achieved by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically transpeptidases, preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains in the bacterial cell wall. This leads to an osmotically unstable cell wall, causing cell lysis and bacterial death, particularly effective during active bacterial multiplication. This action is rapid, occurring shortly after administration, and is most pronounced against susceptible gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus, as well as some gram-negative cocci like Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</li>
<li>The influence over time is closely tied to its pharmacokinetics. Given its short half-life (0.4–0.9 hours for IV/IM administration), frequent dosing is necessary to maintain therapeutic levels, typically every 4–6 hours. For long-acting forms like benzathine penicillin G, the slow release from the injection site provides sustained low levels, maintaining antibacterial activity over weeks, which is crucial for conditions like syphilis requiring prolonged exposure.</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<li>The pharmacokinetic profile of benzylpenicillin varies by administration route and formulation, as detailed below:</li>
<ul>
<li>Absorption:</li>
<ul>
<li>For IV or IM administration of sodium or potassium salts, absorption is rapid, achieving high initial blood levels. Oral absorption is poor, with bioavailability estimated at 15-30% in fasting, healthy humans, primarily due to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach, making oral administration uncommon.</li>
<li>Benzathine penicillin G, administered intramuscularly, is slowly absorbed, leading to transient high initial levels followed by prolonged low concentrations due to its repository nature.</li>
</ul>
<li>Distribution: The volume of distribution is approximately 0.53–0.67 L/kg in adults with normal renal function, indicating good distribution throughout body tissues. It binds to serum proteins, mainly albumin, at a rate of 45-68%.</li>
<li>Metabolism: About 16-30% of an IM dose is metabolized to penicilloic acid, an inactive metabolite, with small amounts converted to 6-aminopenicillanic acid and hydroxylated into active metabolites, all excreted via urine.</li>
<li>Elimination: Primarily renal, with a clearance rate of 560 ml/min in healthy humans. Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. The short half-life (0.4–0.9 hours) necessitates frequent dosing for IV/IM forms.</li>
<li>Half-Life:</li>
<ul>
<li>For sodium/potassium salts (IV/IM): 0.4–0.9 hours.</li>
<li>For benzathine penicillin G: Effective levels are maintained for weeks, with studies showing detectable levels up to 4 weeks after a 1.2 million unit IM injection, with a mean apparent terminal half-life of around 189 hours in some reports.</li>
</ul>
<li>Bioavailability:</li>
<ul>
<li>IV: 100%</li>
<li>IM (sodium/potassium salts): Nearly 100%</li>
<li>Oral: 15-30%, not typically recommended due to poor absorption</li>
<li>Benzathine penicillin G: Provides prolonged low levels via slow release, with pharmacokinetics supporting once-every-4-week dosing for some indications like rheumatic fever prophylaxis.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Dosage Regimens</li>
<li>Dosage varies significantly based on the infection, patient age, and renal function, with specific recommendations as follows:</li>

</table></li>
<ul>
<li>Safe Range: Generally, 600,000 to 24 million units daily for adults, with higher doses (up to 72 million units/day) used for severe infections under close monitoring.</li>
<li>Minimum Effective Dose: Varies by infection; for example, 1.2 million units IM for streptococcal pharyngitis, but must be tailored to microbial susceptibility and condition severity.</li>
<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Up to 24 million units/day for most serious infections, with 72 million units/day reported for gas gangrene, though individual tolerance, especially renal function, must be considered.</li>
<li>LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: LD50 is not typically reported for humans, but research suggests a convulsant dose of approximately 5 g/kg IV, far exceeding therapeutic levels. Toxicity, particularly CNS effects like convulsions, increases at high doses, especially in renal impairment, with interstitial nephritis reported at doses &gt;12 g/day.</li>
</ul>
<li>Safety and Toxicity</li>
<li>Benzylpenicillin has a relatively low toxicity profile at therapeutic doses, with a high therapeutic index. However, several adverse effects and toxicity concerns exist:</li>
<ul>
<li>Common Side Effects: Include diarrhea, allergic reactions (urticaria, rashes, anaphylaxis), and, rarely, CNS toxicity (convulsions, especially at high doses or in severe renal impairment).</li>
<li>Serious Reactions: Interstitial nephritis at doses &gt;12 g/day, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported.</li>
<li>Overdose Management: Discontinue the drug if neurotoxicity is suspected, with IV benzodiazepines and EEG monitoring for refractory cases, as it may inhibit GABA transmission.</li>
</ul>
<li>The evidence leans toward careful monitoring in patients with renal impairment, as the drug's renal excretion means accumulation can lead to toxicity. Allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis, are a significant concern and require pre-treatment assessment.</li>
