<li>Cow milk contains components like antibodies and lactoferrin, which may bolster the immune system, especially in young children. It also has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, potentially aiding in fighting infections. However, its hormonal content, like IGF-1, may influence growth, though this is still being researched.</li>
<li>Beyond nutrition, cow milk has bioactive compounds like transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), used in treating conditions like Crohn’s disease, showing its potential beyond just food.</li>
<li>Cow milk is primarily composed of water (about 87%), with the remainder consisting of proteins, fats, lactose, vitamins, and minerals. The average composition, as outlined in "Milk composition and microbiology - Milk composition", includes 4.9% lactose, 3.4% fat, 3.3% protein, and 0.7% minerals.</li>
<li>Cow milk, particularly colostrum, contains high levels of antibodies and immune factors, which can modulate the immune system. Lactoferrin, a key protein found in cow milk at concentrations of 2–3 g/L.</li>
<li>Cow milk contains casein, which can be broken down into casomorphins, peptides with opioid-like activity. These compounds have been detected in blood after milk consumption, potentially influencing gastrointestinal function or appetite, though their physiological significance in humans is not fully established.</li>
<li>Lactose, the primary carbohydrate in cow milk, provides energy but can cause digestive issues in individuals with lactose intolerance, leading to symptoms like diarrhea and bloating ("Milk: Health benefits and nutrition"). Additionally, milk contains oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics, supporting gut health by promoting beneficial bacteria, as discussed in "Frontiers | Composition, Structure, and Digestive Dynamics of Milk From Different Species—A Review". These gastrointestinal effects are significant pharmacological actions, particularly for those with sensitivities.</li>
<li>A milk cytokine, has been shown to promote remission in pediatric Crohn’s disease when supplemented in enteric nutrition formulas.</li>
<li>Milk glycans, including oligosaccharides, show promise as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents in preclinical studies.</li>
