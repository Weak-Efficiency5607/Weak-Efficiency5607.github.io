<li>Antiviral activity, anxiety reduction, calcium absorption, cardiovascular health, glucose metabolism, muscle growth, and wound healing.</li>
<li>Used to prevent and treat cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus. It works by competing with arginine, an amino acid the virus needs to replicate, potentially reducing outbreak frequency and severity.</li>
<li>It may affect serotonin and GABA receptors, reducing cortisol levels and improving stress-induced anxiety, particularly in populations with low dietary lysine intake.</li>
<li>Lysine enhances calcium absorption in the gut and reduces its loss in urine, which could help maintain bone health and prevent osteoporosis.</li>
<li>Some research indicates Lysine may lower blood pressure and prevent arterial calcification, especially in conditions like uremia. However, the evidence is not yet robust, and more studies are needed to confirm these cardiovascular benefits.</li>
<li>Lysine can attenuate the glucose response to ingested glucose without altering insulin levels, suggesting a role in managing blood sugar, which may benefit individuals with diabetes.</li>
<li>Lysine supports muscle growth by aiding protein synthesis, essential for athletes and those recovering from injuries. It activates satellite cells and enhances muscle protein production, potentially improving muscle strength and mass.</li>
<li>By contributing to collagen formation, Lysine promotes wound healing, supporting skin and tissue repair.</li>
<li>Not synthesized by the human body.</li>
<li>Research, including a 2020 review on <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lysine-benefits">Healthline</a>, suggests that lysine supplementation, at doses over 3 g per day, may reduce the duration and severity of cold sores by blocking arginine, an amino acid essential for HSV replication.</li>
<li>A study cited on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-237/lysine">WebMD</a> found that oral lysine up to 3 g daily for up to a year is possibly safe and effective for prevention, though not all studies agree on its efficacy for treatment.</li>
