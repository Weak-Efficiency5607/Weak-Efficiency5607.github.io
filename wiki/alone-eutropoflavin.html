<li>Also known as: 4'-Dimethylamino-7,8-dihydroxyflavone</li>
<li>Acts as a selective TrkB receptor agonist and function:</li>
<ul>
<li>PI3K/Akt Pathway: Promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis.</li>
<li>MAPK/ERK Pathway: Enhances synaptic strength and memory consolidation, supporting cognitive functions.</li>
<li>PLCγ Pathway: Involved in long-term potentiation, which is essential for learning and memory.</li>
</ul>
<li>Studies suggest it may protect brain cells, promote new cell growth, and have effects similar to antidepressants in animals.</li>
<li>Might improve memory and mental clarity.</li>
<li>Could influence systems like dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in mood and thinking.</li>
<li>Orally bioavailable and readily reaches the brain.</li>
<li>Exhibits robust neuroprotective properties, particularly in protecting dopaminergic neurons from toxicity, such as rotenone-induced damage.</li>
<li>Reduces oxidative stress and promotes neuron survival, potentially offering greater efficacy than tropoflavin due to stronger TrkB binding.</li>
<li>Enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for brain repair and cognitive function. These effects are supported by preclinical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutropoflavin">studies</a> showing improved neuronal growth and connectivity in animal models.</li>
<li>Eutropoflavin has demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in rodents, notably reducing immobility time in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, indicators of antidepressant potential. These effects are dependent on the TrkB pathway, suggesting a role in modulating mood through BDNF signaling.</li>
<li>Indirectly influences several neurotransmitter systems through its BDNF/TrkB activation:</li>
<ul>
<li><table>
<tr>
<th>System</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dopaminergic</td>
<td>Enhances dopamine signaling and neuroprotection, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and striatum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Glutamatergic</td>
<td>Enhances NMDA and AMPA receptor function through increased synaptic plasticity, supporting cognitive processes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Serotonergic</td>
<td>Tied to antidepressant responses, potentially enhancing serotonin-based treatments.</td>
</tr>
</table></li>
</ul>
<li>Impacts sleep regulation, with studies indicating a reduction in non-REM sleep and decreased orexin A levels, which may influence wakefulness and sleep architecture (<a href="https://piracetam.net/eutropoflavin-4-dma-78-dhf-benefits-side-effects/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Tmax of approximately 10 minutes and a plasma half-life of about 2 hours, with effects peaking at 4 hours and partially decaying at 8-16 hours (<a href="https://ethosherbals.com/en/shop/herbs-for-the-spirit/uplifted_mood/eutropoflavin/">source</a>). It is fat-soluble, and absorption is enhanced when taken with a meal containing fat.</li>
<a>In rodents, Eutropoflavin has a Tmax of approximately 10 minutes and a plasma half-life of about 2 hours, with effects peaking at 4 hours and partially decaying at 8-16 hours (<a href="https://ethosherbals.com/en/shop/herbs-for-the-spirit/uplifted_mood/eutropoflavin/">source</a>). It is fat-soluble, and absorption is enhanced when taken with a meal containing fat.</a>
<li>Generally well-tolerated, with rare anecdotal reports of headaches, fatigue, or overstimulation, especially at higher doses (<a href="https://ethosherbals.com/en/shop/herbs-for-the-spirit/uplifted_mood/eutropoflavin/">source</a>).</li>
<li>There are no known tolerance issues, though cycling (e.g., 5 days on/2 days off) is recommended as a precaution.</li>
