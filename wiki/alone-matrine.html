<li>Other name: CAS 519-02-8.</li>
<li>Alkaloid extracted from plants such as Sophora flavescens.</li>
<li>Research suggests the following actions, with mechanisms often involving key signaling pathways:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Anti-cancer Effects: Matrine inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, potentially through pathways like NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin. It arrests the cell cycle at G1/G0 phase and inhibits metastasis, as seen in studies on colorectal and lung cancer cells . For example, it reduced tumor volume in mouse models with inhibition rates of 16.29% and 35.35% (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00588/full">source</a>).</li>
<li>Anti-inflammatory Effects: It reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α, making it promising for conditions like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies on asthmatic mice showed reduced eosinophils and IgE levels, suggesting modulation of Th2 cytokines (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/matrine">source</a>).</li>
<li>Anti-microbial Effects: Matrine demonstrates activity against bacteria and viruses, potentially due to its ability to disrupt microbial cell processes, though specific time courses are not detailed.</li>
<li>Neuroprotective Effects: It may protect against neuronal damage in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, possibly by regulating apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress, as noted in reviews (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.977374/full">source</a>).</li>
<li>Cardioprotective Effects: Matrine has shown potential in treating myocardial ischemia, likely through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, though exact durations of effect are not specified.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Half-Life: Research suggests a plasma half-life of approximately 10.0 ± 2.8 hours in humans, based on a study involving oral administration of Antitumor B (ATB) tablets containing matrine, with individual variations up to 17.06 hours (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817974/">source</a>). In rats, half-lives are shorter, at 92-142 minutes, indicating species differences.</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is low, with rat studies showing 17.1 ± 5.4% at 2 mg/kg, but human data are less clear. The evidence leans toward poor absorption, with efforts to improve it via transdermal routes noted (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874120335704">source</a>). High pre-systemic clearance in humans is suggested, consistent with low exposure levels.</li>
<li>Clinical Doses: Human studies have used oral doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg matrine in soft gelatin capsules, showing dose-related pharmacokinetics (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817974/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range is not fully established, but doses up to 400 mg have been used without severe adverse effects in trials. The minimum effective dose varies by condition; for example, in cancer studies, in vitro concentrations of 50-800 mg/L showed effects, with IC50 at 312.53 mg/L for Hep3B cells (<a href="https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/N390W430AC">source</a>).</li>
<li>Maximum Safe Dose and Danger Threshold: The maximum safe dose is unclear, with reports of toxicity at high concentrations (&gt;140 mg/L in 72 hours causing hepatocyte effects). Given potential hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity, doses exceeding clinical trial levels (e.g., &gt;400 mg) may become dangerous, though exact thresholds are not defined.</li>
<li>LD50: In mice, the intraperitoneal LD50 is 157.13 mg/kg (95% CI 88.08-280.31 mg/kg), and intravenous LD50 is 72.1 mg/kg (95% CL 68.2-76.5 mg/kg), based on acute toxicity tests (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2088002/">source</a>). Oral LD50 data for humans are not available, but animal data suggest high doses are toxic, with oral LD50 in rats reported as &gt;10000 mg/kg for formulated products, likely not pure matrine.</li>
<li>Human Toxicity: Potential adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting), hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes), cardiovascular issues (heart rate changes), neurological effects (dizziness, seizures at high doses), allergic reactions (rashes, swelling), and reproductive toxicity (impacts on fertility, fetal development) (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01067/full">source</a>).</li>
