<li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/S-adenosyl_methionine.png"/></li>
<li>Also known as: S-adenosyl-L-methionine and AdoMet</li>
<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<ul>
<li>Depression: SAMe is implicated in enhancing neurotransmitter activity, particularly dopamine and serotonin turnover, which may improve mood regulation. Research indicates it increases levels of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, lowers serum prolactin, and impacts the noradrenergic system by modifying adrenergic receptor activity. It enhances methylation of catecholamines, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, and may boost gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), potentially supporting neurogenesis. Clinical effects often take weeks to manifest, with studies suggesting improvements noticeable after 4-12 weeks at doses of 200-1600 mg/day, though individual response times vary.</li>
<li>Osteoarthritis: SAMe appears to support joint health by stimulating the production of collagen and proteoglycans, key components of cartilage. It also exhibits painkilling and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially reducing joint pain and stiffness. Mechanisms may include reducing inflammatory mediators, increasing glutathione levels, and signaling cartilage synthesis or survival, though exact pathways are not fully elucidated. Studies suggest benefits may be seen after several weeks, with doses of 600-1200 mg/day used for up to 84 days, showing gradual improvements in functional limitations and pain.</li>
<li>Liver Disease: SAMe plays a critical role in liver health, acting as a precursor for glutathione, which enhances antioxidant defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS). It attenuates pro-inflammatory TNFα-mediated liver injury, induces anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, and protects hepatocytes from apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial cytochrome-c release and caspase-3 activation. It also influences membrane fluidity and bile salt export, aiding in conditions like intra-hepatic cholestasis. Clinical trials, such as a multi-center study with 220 patients at 1600 mg/day, showed symptom improvement within weeks, with effects on cholestasis indices noted early in treatment.</li>
</ul>
<li>Pharmacokinetic Properties</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-life: The half-life for intravenous administration is approximately 80-100 minutes, based on studies with doses like 100 mg, 500 mg, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight. For oral administration, the apparent half-life may be longer due to absorption dynamics, with some studies reporting values around 7.77-16.01 hours for novel formulations, suggesting variability based on formulation and absorption rate. This discrepancy highlights the need for further research into oral pharmacokinetics.</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, estimated at 1-3% for standard formulations, attributed to poor intestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism in the liver. Novel formulations, such as enteric-coated tablets (e.g., MSI-195), can increase bioavailability to around 9%, as seen in pharmacokinetic studies comparing AUC ratios. Intramuscular bioavailability is higher, at 80-90%, offering a more efficient route for systemic exposure. The presence of food can reduce absorption, with studies showing a 55% reduction in AUC when taken with food compared to fasted states.</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage and Safety Considerations</li>
<ul>
<li>Dosage Ranges:</li>
<ul>
<li>Safe Range: Clinical studies commonly use doses up to 1600 mg/day, with evidence suggesting safety for periods up to two years in conditions like alcohol-related liver disease. Doses are typically divided, taken with or without food, though absorption may be better on an empty stomach.</li>
<li>Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition. For depression, studies start at 200 mg/day, escalating to 1600 mg/day for non-responders. For osteoarthritis, effective doses range from 600-1200 mg/day, and for liver disease, 800-1200 mg/day is common, based on trial data.</li>
<li>Maximum Safe Dose: While 1600 mg/day is well-tolerated, higher doses lack extensive safety data. Given mild side effects at higher doses, caution is advised beyond this, especially without medical supervision.</li>
</ul>
<li>Toxicity and LD50:</li>
<ul>
<li>Animal studies provide insight into acute toxicity, with an oral LD50 in rats greater than 4650 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity. Human data on LD50 is unavailable due to ethical constraints, but studies at 1600 mg/day show no significant toxic methylated metabolites or homocysteine elevation, suggesting a wide safety margin.</li>
<li>Chronic toxicity is less studied, but long-term use at therapeutic doses shows mild side effects like gastrointestinal upset, headache, and insomnia, particularly at higher doses.</li>
</ul>
<li>Onset of Danger: Determining when SAMe becomes dangerous is complex. High doses may exacerbate side effects, and in vulnerable populations, such as those with bipolar disorder, even therapeutic doses (e.g., 200-1600 mg/day) can trigger mania, as noted in case reports. The risk increases with pre-existing conditions, and individual sensitivity varies, necessitating medical oversight for high-dose regimens.</li>
