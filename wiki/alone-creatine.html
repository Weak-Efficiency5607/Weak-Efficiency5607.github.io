<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<ul>
<li>Creatine’s primary pharmacological action is to facilitate the recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP through the donation of phosphate groups from phosphocreatine. This process, catalyzed by creatine kinase, is crucial for rapid energy production during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. This mechanism is detailed in sources like Wikipedia: Creatine, which notes its role in ATP recycling, primarily in muscle and brain tissue.</li>
<li>Beyond energy metabolism, creatine may exhibit additional actions, including acting as a pH buffer during intense exercise, potentially reducing acidosis. Emerging research suggests possible antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and neuroprotective benefits, particularly in conditions like neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, DrugBank: Creatine lists creatine as a ligand for various creatine kinases and a product of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, indicating its involvement in cellular energy pathways. However, these secondary actions are less established and require further investigation, as noted in Metabolic Basis of Creatine in Health and Disease, which discusses potential mechanisms beyond energy metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<li>Time to Effect and Influence</li>
<ul>
<li>The time to observe creatine’s pharmacological effects depends on the dosing strategy and the specific action in question. For its primary role in enhancing muscle performance, the key is saturating muscle creatine stores. A loading phase of 20-25 grams per day, divided into 4-5 doses, for 5-7 days can achieve saturation quickly, with performance benefits often noticeable within a week, as supported by Creatine Loading Phase: Research, Benefits, Safety, and How To. Without loading, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams daily can take approximately 28 days to achieve similar saturation, as noted in Does one dose of creatine supplementation fit all?.</li>
<li>For brain-related effects, such as improved cognitive function, higher single doses (e.g., 0.35 g/kg, or about 24.5 g for a 70 kg person) have shown benefits during sleep deprivation, as seen in Single dose creatine improves cognitive performance, but long-term supplementation may be needed for sustained effects. The influence of these actions is dose-dependent, with higher doses accelerating the onset but potentially increasing side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<li>Half-Life</li>
<ul>
<li>The plasma half-life of creatine is approximately 3 hours, as consistently reported in pharmacokinetic studies. This is evident from Creatine - Wikipedia, which states an elimination half-life of just under 3 hours, requiring frequent dosing to maintain elevated plasma levels. This short half-life pertains to plasma clearance and does not reflect the retention time in muscle stores, which can remain elevated for weeks after supplementation ceases, as muscle creatine turnover is slower.</li>
</ul>
<li>Bioavailabilities</li>
<ul>
<li>Creatine monohydrate, the most common supplement form, is considered to have high oral bioavailability, often cited as nearly 100%. This is based on the understanding that it is either absorbed by tissues or excreted in urine, as noted in Bioavailability, Efficacy, Safety, and Regulatory Status of Creatine. However, exact bioavailability percentages in humans are less frequently reported, with animal studies providing some insight. For instance, a rat study found oral bioavailability of 53% at a low dose (10 mg/kg) and 16% at a high dose (70 mg/kg), suggesting dose-dependent absorption, as detailed in Absolute Oral Bioavailability of Creatine Monohydrate in Rats. Given the lack of direct human data, it’s reasonable to conclude that oral bioavailability is high but may vary with dose and formulation, with creatine monohydrate being the most bioavailable form compared to others like creatine lysinate or ethyl ester.</li>
<li>Other routes, such as intravenous, are not typically used for supplementation, so bioavailability data for these are limited and not relevant for standard use.</li>

<li>Background and Context</li>
<ul>
<li>Creatine, a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in foods like meat and fish, is synthesized in the body from amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and methionine. It plays a crucial role in energy production, particularly in muscles, by increasing phosphocreatine stores, which help regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during high-intensity exercise. Supplementation, often at doses of 3-5 grams daily after an optional loading phase of 20 grams daily for 5-7 days, is common among athletes and fitness enthusiasts to enhance performance and muscle mass. However, potential negative impacts have been reported, and this section aims to quantify these effects with percentages and explain their pharmacological basis.</li>

<li>Detailed Analysis of Each Impact</li>
<ul>
<li>Gastrointestinal Distress:</li>
<ul>
<li>Incidence: A comprehensive analysis of 685 clinical trials involving 12,839 creatine users found that 5.51% reported gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, stomach upset, and belching, compared to 4.05% in placebo groups, with no significant difference (p = 0.820) Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. However, a specific study on top-level athletes taking a single 10g dose reported a 56% incidence of diarrhea, significantly higher than the 28.6% in divided doses (2 x 5g) and 35.0% in placebo, indicating dose-dependent effects Gastrointestinal distress after creatine supplementation in athletes: are side effects dose dependent?.</li>
<li>Pharmacology Action: Creatine, particularly in high doses, can exert an osmotic effect in the gastrointestinal tract, drawing water into the intestines and causing diarrhea. This is more pronounced with single large doses due to rapid absorption and concentration in the gut, potentially irritating the stomach lining and leading to stomach upset or belching.</li>
</ul>
<li>Weight Gain due to Water Retention:</li>
<ul>
<li>Incidence: Nearly all users (100%) experience weight gain, typically 1-2 kg, especially during the loading phase (20g/day for 5-7 days). A study found an average increase of 1.7 kg over 4 weeks with high doses (30g initially, then 15g) Creatine monohydrate supplementation on body weight and percent body fat. This effect is consistent across studies, with weight gain primarily due to water retention rather than fat gain.</li>
<li>Pharmacology Action: Creatine increases phosphocreatine stores in muscles, which draws water into the cells via osmotic pressure, leading to intracellular water retention. This is a direct result of creatine’s role in enhancing cellular hydration, which can be perceived as unwanted weight gain, especially for those not seeking muscle mass increase.</li>
</ul>
<li>Muscle Cramping/Pain:</li>
<ul>
<li>Incidence: Approximately 0.5% of creatine users reported muscle cramping or pain, compared to 0.07% in placebo groups, with a marginally significant p-value of 0.085, suggesting no strong evidence of increased risk Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. Anecdotal reports are common, but controlled studies refute a direct link.</li>
<li>Pharmacology Action: The mechanism is unclear, but potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalances might contribute, though studies show creatine may reduce cramping in certain contexts, such as hemodialysis patients, indicating a protective rather than causative role.</li>
</ul>
<li>Other Reported Side Effects:</li>
<ul>
<li>Dehydration, Kidney Damage, Liver Damage, etc.: These are often mentioned anecdotally but lack robust scientific support. The International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand notes that assessments of adverse event reports revealed creatine was rarely mentioned and not associated with significant patterns of adverse events, with no support for increased renal or liver dysfunction International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. A meta-analysis on renal function found no significant alteration in serum creatinine or urea levels, reinforcing safety Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Renal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</li>
<li>Incidence: Very rare, with incidences not significantly different from placebo, often less than 1% based on comprehensive analyses.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Scientific Evidence and Study Findings</li>
<li>Research on creatine's impact on testosterone levels reveals a mixed picture, with the majority of studies suggesting no significant effect. A review by <a href="https://examine.com/faq/can-creatine-increase-your-testosterone-levels/">Examine.com: Can creatine increase your testosterone levels?</a> analyzed multiple trials and concluded that it is unlikely to increase testosterone levels, with the preponderance of evidence supporting no notable change. Similarly, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/what-is-creatine-potential-benefits-and-risks-of-this-popular-supplement">Harvard Health: What is creatine? Potential benefits and risks of this popular supplement</a> explicitly states that creatine does not increase testosterone levels, reinforcing the view that it is not an anabolic steroid.</li>
<li>However, some studies suggest potential effects. For instance, a study published in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19741313/">PubMed: Three weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation affects dihydrotestosterone to testosterone ratio in college-aged rugby players</a> found no change in serum testosterone levels after 7 days of loading and 14 days of maintenance, but noted changes in the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to testosterone ratio, which could have implications for hair health. In contrast, another study from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0765159715000039">ScienceDirect: Effects of short term creatine supplementation and resistance exercises on resting hormonal and cardiovascular responses</a> reported significant increases in resting testosterone concentrations after 5 and 7 days of creatine loading combined with resistance exercises, compared to a placebo group.</li>
<li>To reconcile these findings, a review in the <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w">Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition: Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation</a> provides insight. It notes that while one study (van der Merwe et al., 2009) found a 56% increase in DHT after 7 days and 40% above baseline after 14 days, most other studies (12 total, with doses ranging from 3–25 g/day for 6 days to 12 weeks) showed no significant increase in total or free testosterone, with only two studies reporting small increases and five showing no change in free testosterone. This suggests that any effect on testosterone is not consistent across studies.</li>
<li>Analysis of Variability and Context</li>
<li>The variability in findings may be attributed to differences in study design, participant populations, and supplementation protocols. For example, studies combining creatine with resistance training, like the ScienceDirect study, seem more likely to show increases in testosterone, possibly due to the synergistic effect of exercise on hormonal responses. In contrast, studies without specific exercise interventions, like the PubMed rugby player study, tend to show no change. This suggests that the context of use—particularly whether combined with resistance training—may influence outcomes.</li>
<li>Additionally, the Examine.com review highlighted that all trials involved healthy young men with normal testosterone levels, and no studies have examined the effect on individuals with abnormally low testosterone. This limits the generalizability of findings to other populations, such as older adults or those with hormonal imbalances.</li>

<li>These tables illustrate the mixed evidence, with the majority leaning toward no significant effect, but highlighting the potential for small increases in specific contexts.</li>
<li>Implications and Considerations</li>
<li>For most users, particularly healthy individuals engaging in regular exercise, the evidence suggests that creatine supplementation is unlikely to significantly alter testosterone levels. This is reassuring for those concerned about potential decreases, as no studies indicate a reduction. However, for those hoping for an increase, the small and inconsistent findings mean it's not a reliable strategy for boosting testosterone.</li>
<li>It's also worth noting that changes in DHT, as seen in some studies, have been linked to hair loss concerns, but the <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w">JISSN review</a> clarifies that these changes remain within normal clinical limits and have not been consistently replicated. This suggests that while there may be minor hormonal shifts, they are unlikely to have significant clinical impacts.</li>
