<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>Trans-Resveratrol exhibits a plethora of biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. These actions are mediated through various mechanisms, such as scavenging free radicals, inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, improving endothelial function, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes like β-amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. For instance, studies have shown it can reduce oxidative stress by acting as an efficient scavenger of hydroperoxyl radicals and protect cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6164842/">source</a>).</li>
<li>The user's request for "values for each of time to know how each pharmacological action influences" is somewhat ambiguous, but it likely refers to the time course of these effects, which is tied to its pharmacokinetics. Specific time-dependent values for each action are not universally standardized, as they depend on the condition and study design. However, the pharmacokinetic profile, such as time to peak concentration and half-life, provides insight into the duration and onset of these effects.</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetic Parameters</li>
<li>The pharmacokinetics of trans-Resveratrol are well-documented, with key parameters including:</li>
<ul>
<li>Time to Peak Concentration (Tmax): Research indicates that after oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached between 0.8 and 1.5 hours, depending on the dose and formulation. For example, a study with doses ranging from 0.5 g to 5 g showed peak times within this range (<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/resveratrol">source</a>).</li>
<li>Half-Life (t1/2): The half-life varies based on dosing regimen. For single doses, it ranges from 1 to 3 hours, while with repeated dosing, it extends to 2 to 5 hours, reflecting potential accumulation and altered metabolism.</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, less than 1%, due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, where it is rapidly conjugated into glucuronides and sulfates. Intravenous administration, however, achieves 100% bioavailability, though this route is less common in clinical settings, but standard bioavailability remains low. (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mnfr.201701057">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
<li>Other routes, such as intraperitoneal in animal studies, are not typically relevant for human administration, so the focus remains on oral and intravenous routes.</li>
<li>Dosage and Safety Profile</li>
<li>Dosage recommendations and safety margins are critical for practical application:</li>
<ul>
<li>Typical Supplement Doses: Commonly available supplements range from 100 mg to 1 g per day, reflecting typical usage for health benefits like cardiovascular support and anti-aging effects (<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/resveratrol-benefits">source</a>).</li>
<li>Studied Doses in Clinical Trials: Clinical trials have explored a wide range, from 8 mg/day for certain cardiovascular effects to as high as 5 g/day, with no marked toxicity reported at the higher end (<a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/resveratrol">source</a>).</li>
<li>Safe Range: Studies suggest that doses up to 5 g per day are generally well-tolerated, with side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain reported at higher doses, typically above 1 g/day. These effects are generally mild and reversible. (<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/resveratrol-benefits">source</a>)</li>
<li>Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose varies by condition. For example, a meta-analysis found cardiovascular benefits at doses as low as 10 mg/day, while diabetes management often requires 300 mg/day. This variability underscores the need for condition-specific dosing. (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/resveratrol">source</a>)</li>
<li>Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Based on clinical data, up to 5 g per day appears safe, with no severe adverse effects reported, though gastrointestinal issues may occur at the higher end (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20013887/">source</a>).</li>
<li>LD50 and Acute Toxicity: The LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of subjects) is not readily available in the literature, which suggests low acute toxicity. Animal studies, such as those in rats and mice, use high doses (e.g., 50 mg/kg/day) without reporting lethality, indicating a wide safety margin. For zebrafish, LD50 values of 51.4-75.3 mg/L are reported for aquatic toxicity, but these are not directly comparable to oral mammalian toxicity. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7139620/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Estimation of When It Becomes Too Dangerous: Given the lack of reported LD50 and the tolerance of high doses in humans (up to 5 g/day), it seems likely that significant danger would only arise at doses far exceeding this, potentially in the range of grams per kilogram, but specific thresholds are not established due to limited toxicity data.</li>
</ul>
<li>Comparative Analysis</li>
<li>The user's query implies a comparison between "Resveratrol (trans)" and "Resveratrol," which, given the context, likely refers to trans-Resveratrol versus the general term, potentially including cis-Resveratrol. Trans-Resveratrol is the dominant and biologically active form, with cis-Resveratrol being less stable and less studied. Literature consistently highlights trans-Resveratrol's superior bioavailability and efficacy, with no significant pharmacological actions attributed to cis-Resveratrol in comparison (<a href="https://foryouth.co/blogs/magazine/trans-resveratrol-vs-resveratrol">source</a>). Thus, the comparison is largely moot, as trans-Resveratrol encompasses the actions and parameters discussed.</li>
