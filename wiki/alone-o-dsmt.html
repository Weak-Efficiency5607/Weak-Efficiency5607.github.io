<li>Also known as desmetramadol and O-desmethyltramadol.</li>
<li>Key component of the pain medication tramadol.</li>
<li>Known for its strong pain-relieving effects.</li>
<li>Works primarily by mimicking natural painkillers in the body.</li>
<li>Influences other systems to help manage pain, especially in complex cases.</li>
<li>Mainly activates μ-opioid receptors.</li>
<li>Much stronger than tramadol, with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/o-desmethyltramadol">studies</a> showing it’s 2–4 times more potent.</li>
<li>Block the reuptake of norepinephrine, particularly with the (-)-enantiomer.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.01680/full">Research</a> indicates it may cause fewer breathing issues compared to other strong painkillers.</li>
<li>For people with kidney problems, O-DSMT can build up, increasing risks like seizures or breathing difficulties, so doctors often lower the dose.</li>
<li>It's the primary active metabolite of tramadol.</li>
<li>O-DSMT is formed through the demethylation of tramadol by the liver enzyme CYP2D6, a process analogous to the metabolism of codeine to morphine.</li>
<li>As of May 7, 2025, O-DSMT is not approved for medicinal use in any country but is significant in research and has been noted as a designer drug due to its unscheduled status in some jurisdictions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmetramadol">source</a>).</li>
<li>The (+)-enantiomer is identified as a G-protein biased full agonist, which means it preferentially activates the G-protein signaling pathway over the β-arrestin pathway. This bias is significant as it may reduce adverse effects like respiratory depression, a major concern with opioids.</li>
<li>Up to 200 times greater affinity for μ-opioid receptor than tramadol.</li>
<li>Also shows far lower affinity for δ- and κ-opioid receptors.</li>
<li>Both enantiomers are inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, distinguishing it from tramadol, which has dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties (<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-Desmethyltramadol">source</a>).</li>

<li>Antagonism at the 5-HT2C receptor at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This antagonism can lead to increased release of dopamine and norepinephrine, potentially influencing mood, anxiety, feeding behavior, and reproductive behavior (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmetramadol">source</a>).</li>
<li>Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can significantly impact its efficacy and safety.</li>
<li>CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience reduced analgesia, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may face increased risks of side effects like respiratory depression and death due to higher O-DSMT levels (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8262591/">source</a>).</li>
