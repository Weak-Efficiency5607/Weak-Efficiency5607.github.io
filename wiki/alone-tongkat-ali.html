<li>Pharmacological Actions and Time to Effect</li>
<li>Tongkat Ali, scientifically known as Eurycoma longifolia, is a traditional herbal medicine with a wide range of potential pharmacological effects, supported by both in vitro and in vivo studies. Below is a detailed breakdown, including the time it takes for each action to manifest, based on clinical and preclinical evidence:</li>
<ul>
<li>Male Fertility Enhancement: This action includes enhancing semen volume, spermatozoa count, and motility, as well as increasing testosterone production and improving erectile function and sexual libido. Studies show sperm motility increased by 44.4% and semen volume by 18.2% after 12 weeks of supplementation, with testosterone increases of 30.2% in rat models (<a href="https://www.transparentlabs.com/blogs/all/how-long-before-tongkat-ali-starts-to-work">source</a>).</li>
<li>Antimalarial Effect: Effective against Plasmodium falciparum, with IC50, IC90, and IC99 values for extract at 14.72, 139.65, and 874.15 μg/L respectively, compared to artemisinin at 4.30, 45.48, and 310.97 μg/L. Time to effect is not well-documented in humans, primarily studied in vitro (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Cytotoxic and Anti-Proliferative Effects: Demonstrates cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines like A-549, MCF-7, and HeLa, with IC50 values for NF-κB inhibitors &lt;1 μM and cell viability ranging from 21.01%–66.9% at 100 μM for HeLa cells. These effects are typically measured in vitro, with no specific time to effect in humans (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Antimicrobial Effects: Active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, with inhibition zones of 7–25 mm and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 75 mg/mL for S. aureus and 25 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa. Time to effect is not specified, as it’s primarily an in vitro measure (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Inhibits NF-κB with IC50 values &lt;1 μM, activates Nrf2 via ROS-dependent p38 MAPK pathway, and shows antioxidant activity at 10–250 µg/mL. Time to effect in humans is not well-documented, but animal studies suggest rapid onset (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Anti-Anxiolytic Effects: Reduces anxiety in mice, similar to diazepam, and improves stress hormone profiles in humans, with significant effects observed after 4 weeks in clinical trials (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669033/">source</a>).</li>
<li>Antidiabetic Effects: Decreases blood glucose by 38%–47% at 150 mg/kg in hyperglycemic rats and enhances glucose uptake &gt;200% at 50 μg/mL. Time to effect in humans is not specified, but animal studies suggest weeks of supplementation (<a href="https://www.drugs.com/npp/eurycoma-longifolia.html">source</a>).</li>
<li>Osteoporosis Preventive Effects: Prevents bone calcium loss, stimulates osteoblast proliferation, and enhances testosterone levels, with no specific time to effect documented in humans, likely requiring chronic use (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Effects: Includes hormonal (anti-estrogenic), ergogenic (increases muscle strength), insecticidal, muscular, antiulcer, and anti-rheumatism effects. For ergogenic effects, benefits are seen after 5-8 weeks, with Cmax and Tmax for eurycomanone at 0.33 ± 0.03 mcg/mL and 4.40 ± 0.98 h, respectively (<a href="https://www.transparentlabs.com/blogs/all/how-long-before-tongkat-ali-starts-to-work">source</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<li>The pharmacokinetics of Tongkat Ali, particularly for its active compounds like eurycomanone, are crucial for understanding its efficacy and safety. Below are the detailed parameters:</li>
<ul>
<li>Half-life: For eurycomanone, studies report a half-life of 0.35 ± 0.04 h in one study and 1.00 ± 0.26 h in another, suggesting variability possibly due to formulation or species (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>). For 13α(21)-epoxy-eurycomanone, the half-life is 0.75 ± 0.25 h, longer due to lower elimination rate.</li>
<li>Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability for eurycomanone is 10.5%, with Cmax at 0.33 ± 0.03 mcg/mL and Tmax at 4.40 ± 0.98 h. For 9-methoxycanthin-6-one, absorption is &lt;1% orally, indicating poor bioavailability for some compounds (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>Distribution and Excretion: Eurycomanone has a volume of distribution (V_d) of 0.68 ± 0.30 L/kg, well distributed in extravascular fluids, with an elimination rate constant (k_e) of 0.88 ± 0.19 h⁻¹ and clearance (CL) of 0.39 ± 0.08 L/h/kg (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
<li>CYP Inhibition: Eurycomanone shows IC50 &gt;250 μg/mL for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, indicating a low likelihood of drug-herb interactions (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/3/331">source</a>).</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage and Safety</li>
<li>Dosage recommendations and safety profiles are critical for practical use. Below is a detailed table summarizing the dosage ranges, safety data, and toxicity information:</li>
