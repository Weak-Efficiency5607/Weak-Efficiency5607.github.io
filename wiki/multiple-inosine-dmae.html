<li>Inosine and DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) are compounds used in various health contexts, with Inosine often part of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments like Imunovir (Inosine Pranobex), and DMAE marketed for cognitive and skin health. The combination, termed "homemade Imunovir," is not a pharmaceutical product but is discussed in forums as a potential substitute, particularly for conditions like ME/CFS. This note synthesizes available data to provide detailed insights into their pharmacological actions, time courses, pharmacokinetics, and dosage considerations.</li>
<li>Pharmacological Actions</li>
<li>Inosine:</li>
<ul>
<li>Inosine is a nucleoside involved in purine metabolism, with significant immunomodulatory effects. It enhances T-cell lymphocyte proliferation, boosts natural killer cell activity, and increases pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring deficient immune responses in immunosuppressed patients [PMC6822865]. It is also used in antiviral contexts, such as in Imunovir for herpes simplex and other viral infections, likely by affecting viral RNA levels and supporting immune function.</li>
<li>Emerging research suggests neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective roles, with potential benefits in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis [DrugBank DB04335].</li>
</ul>
<li>DMAE:</li>
<ul>
<li>DMAE is structurally similar to choline and is believed to support acetylcholine production, a neurotransmitter crucial for memory and focus, though it's not a direct precursor [Nootropics Expert]. It is used in supplements for cognitive enhancement, with studies exploring benefits for ADHD, depression, and Alzheimer's, though evidence is limited and older [Healthline].</li>
<li>In cosmetics, 3% DMAE gel has shown efficacy in reducing wrinkles and improving skin appearance over 16 weeks, suggesting anti-aging properties [PubMed 15675889].</li>
</ul>
<li>Combination (Inosine + DMAE):</li>
<ul>
<li>Specific studies on the combination are scarce, but forum discussions (e.g., Phoenix Rising) suggest users aim to mimic Imunovir's effects, which includes Inosine combined with dimepranol acedoben, not DMAE. User reports indicate varied experiences: some found benefits similar to Imunovir, while others reported overstimulation, dizziness, and confusion, suggesting DMAE might add cognitive or stimulatory effects not present in Imunovir [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113].</li>
<li>Given Inosine's immune focus and DMAE's cognitive potential, the combination might theoretically offer both immunomodulation and brain support, but this is speculative without clinical data.</li>
</ul>
<li>Time Courses of Pharmacological Actions</li>
<ul>
<li>Inosine: Immunomodulatory effects, such as increased T-cell activity, may take days to weeks to manifest, as immune responses often require sustained exposure. Antiviral effects, when part of combinations like Imunovir, are typically seen over treatment courses of 7-14 days for herpes infections [Medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2824].</li>
<li>DMAE: Cognitive effects, if present, might be noticed more quickly, potentially within hours to days, given its role in neurotransmitter support, though evidence is limited. Skin benefits from topical DMAE were observed over 16 weeks in clinical studies [PubMed 15675889].</li>
<li>Combination: Without specific studies, time courses are inferred from individual components. Immune effects might lag, while cognitive effects could be quicker, but user reports suggest immediate overstimulation risks, indicating rapid onset for some effects [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113].</li>
</ul>
<li>Pharmacokinetics</li>
<li>Half-Life:</li>
<ul>
<li>Inosine: Estimated at approximately 15 hours, based on its metabolism as a stable purine nucleoside, with a longer half-life compared to adenosine (about 10 seconds) [PubMed 26903141].</li>
<li>DMAE: Specific half-life data is not widely available, but studies suggest a half-life of around 24 hours in fetal rat brain cell cultures, and excretion data (57–64% in urine within 24 hours in rats) implies a half-life of several hours, likely 12-24 hours [PMC7252906].</li>
</ul>
<li>Bioavailability:</li>
<ul>
<li>Inosine: Orally bioavailable, with up to 70% recovered as urinary uric acid in animal studies, indicating significant absorption [Medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2824]. Clinical trials for Parkinson's used oral doses effectively, suggesting good bioavailability [JAMA 2784144].</li>
<li>DMAE: Well-absorbed orally, with animal studies showing 21–44% tissue retention at 24 hours and significant urinary excretion, indicating good oral bioavailability [PMC7252906].</li>
</ul>
<li>Different Bioavailabilities (Including Oral Route):</li>
<ul>
<li>Both compounds are primarily considered for oral administration, with no specific data on other routes for the combination. Inosine's oral bioavailability is supported by its use in oral formulations, while DMAE's is confirmed by animal studies showing absorption and distribution.</li>
</ul>
<li>Dosage Information</li>
<li>The following table summarizes dosage details for Inosine and DMAE, based on available literature and user reports:</li>

<ul>
<li>Combination Considerations: Start with low doses (e.g., 500 mg Inosine and 100 mg DMAE daily) and monitor for side effects, especially overstimulation or sleep issues, as reported in forums [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. Adjust based on individual tolerance, and consult a healthcare professional, particularly for ME/CFS patients where stimulants may be harmful.</li>
</ul>
<li>Safety and Side Effects</li>
<ul>
<li>Inosine: Main concerns include elevated uric acid levels, potentially leading to gout or kidney stones, as seen in MS trials where 4/16 patients developed kidney stones [Wikipedia Inosine]. Clinical trials for Parkinson's used doses up to 2 g/day, generally well-tolerated with monitoring [JAMA 2784144].</li>
<li>DMAE: Reported side effects include insomnia, muscle tension, headaches, and overstimulation, especially at higher doses. Forum users noted dizziness and confusion with the combination, suggesting caution [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. The LD50 in rats (1803 mg/kg oral) indicates high toxicity thresholds, but therapeutic doses are much lower.</li>
<li>Combination: User reports highlight risks of overstimulation, with some finding it intolerable, particularly in ME/CFS contexts. Dr. Ros Vallings noted 33% of ME/CFS patients benefit from Imunovir, but 10% cannot tolerate it, suggesting similar risks for the homemade version [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113].</li>
