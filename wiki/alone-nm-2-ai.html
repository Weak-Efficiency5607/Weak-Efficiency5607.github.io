<li>Other name: N-methyl-2-aminoindane.</li>
<li>A stimulant substance of the aminoindane class.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent, with a IC50 of 2.4 μM for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.</li>
<li>TAAR1 receptor agonist, with an EC50 of 3.3 μM.</li>
<li>Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist, with a Ki of 0.49 μM.</li>
<li>Binding affinity to 5-HT1A receptor, with a Ki of 3.6 μM.</li>
<li>Binding affinity to 5-HT2A receptor, with a Ki of 5.4 μM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notably, it does not significantly release serotonin or dopamine even at high concentrations (up to 100 μM), suggesting a selective profile focused on norepinephrine systems. This selectivity is derived from in vitro studies, as detailed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NM-2-AI">Wikipedia: NM-2-AI</a>.</li>
<li>User reports from platforms like Bluelight.org suggest that effects are felt within an hour of oral ingestion, with one report noting effects at 50 mg after one hour, described as mood uplift and clear-headedness. The duration isn't specified, but related compounds and user experiences imply effects may last several hours, aligning with its stimulant nature.</li>
<li>The half-life, based on animal studies, is estimated at 1-2 hours. This estimation comes from a metabolism study in mice, where blood concentrations decreased from 2.7 µg/mL at 30 minutes to 0.23 µg/mL at 300 minutes, suggesting a half-life around 1.3 hours via rough calculation, consistent with a reported 1-2 hour half-life for its metabolite, 2-AI, in rat brain from a study on MDAI pharmacokinetics (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584616300513">source</a>).</li>
<li>Dosage recommendations are primarily derived from user reports and online sources like PsychonautWiki, with the following ranges for oral administration:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Threshold: Listed as 5 mg, though user reports suggest 50 mg is often the effective starting dose, indicating potential variability.</li>
<li>Light: 50-100 mg, where users report positive effects like mood uplift and enhanced reaction times.</li>
<li>Common: 100-150 mg, noted as a typical range, but with some reports of negative effects like mood depression and irritability.</li>
<li>Strong: 150-200 mg, potentially increasing intensity but also risks.</li>
<li>Heavy: Over 200 mg, considered high risk with limited data on safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User reports from Bluelight.org provide additional context:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>At 50 mg, effects included uplifted mood, clear head, and improved gaming performance, suggesting this as a minimum effective dose for many.</li>
<li>At 100-150 mg, some users reported it as a "mood killer," with depressive effects and potential anger, indicating the start of adverse effects.</li>
<li>Related compound 2-AI reports mention nausea and vomiting at higher doses, which may apply to NM-2-AI at similar levels.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The safe range and maximum dose without high risks are also unclear due to limited toxicity data. User reports suggest that doses above 100-150 mg may start to become too dangerous, with potential for adverse effects like mood changes and physical symptoms. The minimum effective dose appears to be around 50 mg based on user experiences, aligning with light dose ranges.</li>
