It is not for human or veterinary use.\r\n              Handle with appropriate safety protocols. Hide Description More info Lysergamides 1P-LSD (100mcg Blotters) Form: Blotter View Description Shop 1P-LSD (100mcg Blotters) X Formula: C₂₃H₂₉N₃O₂ Molar Mass: 379.504 g·mol⁻¹ IUPAC: (6aR,9R)-N,N-Diethyl-7-methyl-4-propanoyl-6,6a,8,9-tetrahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide Form: Blotter 1P-LSD, or 1-propionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a lysergamide derivative first synthesized in 2015.\r\n              It is a structural analog of LSD, distinguished by the presence of a propionyl group attached to the indole nitrogen.\r\n              Due to its close structural relationship with LSD, ALD-52, and 1B-LSD, 1P-LSD is frequently examined in chemical\r\n              research involving lysergic acid derivatives. Researchers have studied its stability, potential degradation pathways,\r\n              and interactions with chromatography-based detection methods. ⚠️ Safety Precaution: This product is strictly intended for research and forensic applications. It is not for human or veterinary use.\r\n              Proper safety protocols should be followed when handling. Hide Description More info Tryptamines 4-AcO-DMT Form: Fumarate View Description Shop 4-AcO-DMT X Formula: C₁₄H₁₈N₂O₂ Molar Mass: 246.310 g·mol⁻¹ IUPAC: 3-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-yl acetate Form: Fumarate First synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1963, 4-AcO-DMT, or O-Acetylpsilocin, is a semi-synthetic derivative of psilocin.\r\n              It is structurally similar to the naturally occurring alkaloid found in psilocybin mushrooms, differing only by the presence\r\n              of an acetoxy group. Due to its close relationship with other tryptamines, it has been studied in the field of forensic and\r\n              analytical chemistry for its chemical behavior and stability. ⚠️ Safety Precaution: This product is for research and forensic applications only. Not for human or veterinary use.\r\n              Handle according to appropriate safety protocols. Hide Description More info Tryptamines 4-HO-MET Form: Fumarate View Description Shop 4-HO-MET X Formula: C₁₃H₁₈N₂O Molar Mass: 218.300 g·mol⁻¹ IUPAC: 3-{2-[Ethyl(methyl)amino]ethyl}-1H-indol-4-ol Form: Fumarate 4-HO-MET, or 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine, belongs to the tryptamine family and is structurally related\r\n              to psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin mushrooms. It is an ethyl-substituted homolog of 4-AcO-DMT and\r\n              shares a similar core structure to naturally occurring tryptamines. First documented by Alexander Shulgin in “TiHKAL,”\r\n              this compound has been of interest in analytical chemistry for its role in the study of synthetic and naturally\r\n              derived tryptamines. ⚠️ Safety Precaution: This product is for research and forensic applications only. Not for human or veterinary use.\r\n              Handle with appropriate safety measures.

I recently placed an order on the website. From placing the order to receiving the product was less than one day! The customer service is second to none. I wrote in with some questions which were replied to almost immediately in a freindly, helpful, and caring manner; a thing that is all too rare in an time where customer service is generally slow, cold and impersonal. The products are reliable and high quality. I cannot recommend too highly! - michael I have ordered from Raw Powders a few times and the quality of their supplements has been great.

SARMs are tools to make your workout more effective OUR ANABOLIC BLENDS The blend of most powerful cutting and bulking anabolics formulated to BURN all the fat and water for getting massive and ripped muscles at most efficiently. GROWTH FACTORS/PEPTIDES Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) are a class of peptides that have piqued the interest of bodybuilders due to their ability to increase the synthesis and release of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. It can aid in muscle building and stimulate fat reduction. It accomplishes this by inducing the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1, in turn, stimulates muscle protein synthesis and growth. It also appears to indirectly enhance body fat's breakdown. Reviews for buying products & contact with us Better yet, see us in person!

Here at Underdoglabs™, all of our products are manufactured only in GMP-certified facilities and are Pharmaceutical grade. GMP refers to the Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administrations under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. underdoglabs™ Lifescience goes one step further by using advanced analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, to ensure our products meet label claims for potency and purity. Underdoglabs™ tests its products using US Pharmacopeia and other exacting pharmaceutical assay standards. Finally, a Certificate of Analysis (COA) guaranteeing every one of our products’ quality, potency, and purity is kept on file and available. For more information please download the COA on every product page. We believe the quality of our products is finest, hereby we fully stand by our products & offer full refund as our guarantee program. What does Underdoglabs™ do to ensure the quality of its products? FDA registered, USA based analytical testing laboratories are used for all of our product testing. Each batch is first tested by manufacturer & double tested by us in laboratory and COA (certificate of analysis) is released on the basis of lab tests. Only after our Director of Quality Control determines the materials are compliant and per specifications, are they inventoried and made available for production. Some of our key laboratory procedures and objectives are: • Advanced analytical methods for testing the quality and efficacy of products. • Documentation of Certificate of Analysis for every product. • Procedures that follow industry-standard methodologies such as ASTM, ISO, as well as US, European, and Japanese Pharmacopoeia. • 3rd Party laboratory testing. The bottom line is we are fully commited to assuring our customers receive only the finest and purest ingredients. What's the difference between tablets, capsules and Powder? Material inside the capsules are exactly as same as powder form with same potency. It is better to intake in powdered form if one is taking more than one supplement. Powdered form have more bioavailability and better absorbed by body. If you want a capsule form, a person can buy empty gelatin capsules and fill the powder himself and save big bucks. How does the underdoglabs offers best price on Supplements online?

More About Us 9 Years Experience In Researching Nootropics Shop Research‑Grade Nootropics Online Research-Grade Reagents & Reference Materials Skip the hype; get traceable lab materials. Euro-Nootropics supplies analytical-grade reagents and reference standards for method development, calibration, and QC. Each lot is identity-verified (HPLC/LC-MS, NMR/FTIR, where applicable), issued with a Certificate of Analysis (CoA) and SDS , and labeled per REACH/CLP for clean audit trails. Our catalog spans heterocyclics, amino-derivatives, cholinergic probes, and other research tools—curated for consistency and documentation , not consumer use. We prioritize transparency : batch numbers, purity specs, and test methods are disclosed so you can reproduce results and compare across studies. If a compound doesn’t meet our release criteria, it doesn’t ship. Why Choose Euro Nootropics? – Quality You Can Trust Unmatched Purity and Transparency At Euro Nootropics, quality isn’t a buzzword – it’s a promise. We work with reputable manufacturers who adhere to strict quality control procedures, then subject every batch of product to independent testing using techniques such as High‑Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry. The result? Compounds that are consistently high in purity and free from impurities. Unlike many vendors who hide behind vague claims, we publish our test results. You can browse product pages and see the COA for yourself. If you ever have a question about a batch, our team is ready to provide answers. Customer‑Focused Service Our relationship with customers doesn’t end at checkout. We know buying cognitive enhancers can be confusing, especially if you’re new to the world of nootropics.

OUR PRODUCTS Top Nootropics Categories Cholinergic Nootropics: Enhance Memory and Learning with High‑Purity Supplements Eugeroic Nootropics for Wakefulness, Focus, and Mental Clarity Glutamatergic Nootropics for Learning, Focus, and Neuroplasticity Neuroprotective Nootropics – Support Brain Health and Longevity Nootropic Powders: Flexible Cognitive Enhancement with High‑Purity Supplements Solutions: Nootropic Liquids & Sprays for Serious Researchers Discover Our Nootropic Categories Variety is key to finding the perfect chemicals for your needs. That’s why our catalog covers multiple categories, each tailored to support specific aspects of research. Below, we introduce our main categories and link to the corresponding product pages so you can explore in depth. Neuroprotective Nootropis Protecting your brain cells is just as important as boosting performance. Our neuroprotective nootropic chemicals are designed to help safeguard neurons against oxidative stress, inflammation and age‑related decline. This category includes compounds like emoxypine succinate, known for its antioxidant properties, and NSI‑189, a research peptide believed to support neurogenesis. We also carry 9‑Me‑BC, a benzimidazole derivative thought to stimulate the growth of nerve cells. Each product page offers detailed information on how these compounds may protect and support brain health. Visit: Explore Neuroprotective Nootropics A healthy brain isn’t just about sharp thinking; it’s about resilience. Our neuroprotective formulas focus on promoting longevity and recovery. If you’re conducting research on neurodegenerative diseases or simply want to support long‑term brain health, this category is a must‑visit. You’ll find powders and solutions that blend seamlessly into your existing regimen, whether you’re studying them in isolation or stacking them with other compounds. With Euro Nootropics, you can trust that every neuroprotective compound has been tested for purity and potency.

Our lineup features classic racetams like piracetam, aniracetam and pramiracetam, as well as choline donors like alpha‑GPC and citicoline (CDP‑Choline).

Get consultation Womens’s Health Men’s Health Weight Loss All Themes FAQ How is an Online Pharmacy different than my local pharmacy? You will find that our pharmacy can save you up to 50% or more on your local drug store prices for non-prescription drugs. Now with our affiliate pharmacies we can offer an increased range of products at some of the best possible pharmaceutical buying power World-wide. What is Kiwi? Kiwi is your own International online pharmacy. We are proud to offer many popular drugs, medicines and general healthcare items at fantastic competitive pharmacy prices. Our professional team assures you that your medicines will be packed, shipped and delivered to your home in express time! Kiwi is a secure online shopping site that uses the best encryption software and you can be safe in the knowledge that Kiwi is backed by a network of successful pharmacies in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, the USA, Canada and India. Seeing an opportunity to provide quality, cheaper over-the-counter pharmacy products globally our Internet pharmacy was created and has been keeping international customers satisfied since its inception. How can I be sure Kiwi is legitimate? Kiwi initially operated solely from a large New Zealand pharmacy store that has been established for over 40 years. As a New Zealand pharmacy, we are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand and the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. Our pharmacists are registered with the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand. Our pharmacy is audited on a regular basis by Medsafe (the New Zealand medicines control authority), in accordance with the laws of operating a New Zealand pharmacy. You can be safe in the assurance that our pharmacy has passed all the requirements of the Medsafe authority.\r\n\r\nOur pharmacists are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand. The Pharmaceutical Society is the professional body for New Zealand pharmacists. The Society provides professional support, education, training and career development for all pharmacists, assisting and enabling them to deliver best practice and professional services for the public.\r\n\r\nAs we are a full retail and dispensing pharmacy, we are also members of the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. The Pharmacy Guild provides member pharmacies and pharmacists with a diverse range of services designed to support and enhance the commercial and professional interests of community pharmacy.\r\n\r\nIn order to become a qualified pharmacist in New Zealand, there is a requirement of a minimum of four years University study, followed by a full year of on-site training. Only once the trainee intern is fully appraised at the end of this fifth year (by means of practical examinations), can they be certified as a qualified pharmacist. All pharmacists in New Zealand must undergo continuing education, meaning that they must continue to actively learn and study during their career as a pharmacist.\r\n\r\nOur affiliate pharmacies are all licensed and regulated pharmacies in their jurisdiction and their service and support is guaranteed. When reading reviews, make sure to read from a site that verifies the reviewer is a real customer, such as Trustpilot. How am I able to buy prescription medicines without seeing my doctor? Kiwi operates its online doctor service from countries, such as the UK, where the online doctor service is regulated and the doctors and pharmacies we work with are regulated and approved to provide online doctor consultations in those regions. Kiwi Drug's Doctor Service is not intended to replace the care of your primacy care physician. We have a policy that customers must consult their regular phy"

The expression of cloned genes under the control of the lac operon is induced by IPTG. IPTG is often used in the induction of recombinant proteins, is a substrate for thigalactoside transacetylase and has been reported to induce penicillinase in bacteria. IPTG is commonly used in cloning procedures that require induction of β-galactosidase and is most often used with X-Gal for blue/white bacterial colony screening. Order now!
