La estructura cristalina ha cambiado notablemente. 22.3.2024 En la 67ª Sesión de la Comisión de Estupefacientes , nuestro producto 2FDCK fue puesto bajo control internacional y será prohibido en los Países Bajos en un año. 10.12.2023 Hemos producido 2CMC y creemos que será nuestro nuevo superventas. 11.9.2023 La prohibición holandesa de 3cmc y Euthylon apareció en el Staatsblad , por lo que estas sustancias son ahora ilegales. También hubo una sesión plenaria hoy sobre la próxima ley analógica 'legislación' , por lo que las autoridades están avanzando con la ley. 21.8.2023 Puedes seleccionar GLS como mensajería nuevamente. 25.6.2023 Hemos descubierto un buen inhibidor triple de recaptación con una corta duración de acción que no está cubierto por ninguna de las leyes analógicas europeas. Estamos trabajando en su escalado. 11.3.2023 ¡Hemos reducido drásticamente todos los precios de venta! 31.1.2023 Ahora ofrecemos DPD como un nuevo método de envío. 28.3.2022 En una acción conjunta, la EMCDDA y la UNODC han puesto 3CMC y Euthylon bajo control internacional, por lo que se puede esperar una prohibición en los Países Bajos en 6-12 meses. 12.1.2022 Hicimos nuestro primer lote de O-PCE cristales. 18.11.2021 Hemos producido 2 nuevos productos. Los cristales de 2MMC están disponibles al por mayor y el polvo de 4Me-NEB está disponible en cantidades minoristas. 1.10.2020 Firmando la petición contra el próximo cambio de ley en los Países Bajos: startbeterdrugsbeleid.nl 17.8.2020 Recibimos el primer lote de 3MMA (3-Me-MA, 3-Metil-Metanfetamina), nuestra nueva invención. 6.6.2020 Acabamos de recibir el primer lote de nuestra invención Mephedrene . Está listo para ordenar. Nuestros estudios internos sugieren una farmacología similar a 4FA o 4MMC, liberando serotonina, dopamina y norepinefrina. 15.4.2020 El gobierno holandés planea prohibir cada una de las drogas del futuro.

It is a presumed prodrug of LSD, which means it is thought to be converted into LSD-25 by the human body upon ingestion. What are the effects of 1S-LSD? As far as our research has shown, the effects of 1S-LSD are very similar to 1D-LSD (1T-LSD) 1V-LSD, 1cP-LSD and LSD-25. There is as of yet no consensus, and that is for the individual researcher to discover! How long does a 1S-LSD experience last? Normally, a standard research experience with either our 150mcg 1S-LSD Blotters or 225mcg 1S-LSD Pellets lasts around 6-8 hours. Where can I buy 1S-LSD? You can buy 1S-LSD directly from us at Chemical Collective. Microdosing 1S-LSD & other legal LSD Derivatives For conducting research with very small quantities of 1S-LSD – also known as “microdosing” – we recommend our 1S-LSD 10mcg pellets . Microdosing is a popular way of conducting research with legal LSD derivatives, as the results are generally much more subtle than when using larger quantities. Be sure to check out our articles How to Microdose and Microdosing – Everything We Know for more information. Same day Shipping Same day shipping when payments are received before 1PM (CET) Mon-Fri.

If you’re looking for disposable C-liquid vapes, you’ve come to the correct spot. We’re always looking for new items to carry, and our Hipster Vapes selection is our latest C-liquid offering. The best part is that we carry a flavor for every taste, so no matter what you’re looking for, we’ve got it. We carry everything from liquid concentrates to flavored e-liquids. The Hipster vapes specifically come in fun flavors like Bubblegum and Pomegranate. If you’ve never experienced C-liquids, imagine taking a smooth, flavorful hit from a vape pen, but instead of nicotine or regular weed, you’re puffing on something a little different, something infused with cannabinoids like CBD, Delta-8, HHC, or even synthetic THC alternatives. That’s the world of C-liquid vapes, a growing trend in the cannabis and vaping scene. These aren’t your typical e-liquids. While most vape juices are packed with nicotine or just flavoring, C-liquids are specially blended with extracts from hemp or lab-made cannabinoids. Some give you a mild buzz, others promise relaxation without the high, and a few are strong enough to rival traditional THC. Let’s talk a little bit about the different things that might be in C-liquids. CBD vape juice contains cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating compound derived from hemp. Users report effects like relaxation, reduced anxiety, and mild pain relief without psychoactive effects. It’s commonly chosen by those who want the therapeutic aspects of cannabis without impairment. Delta-8 THC liquid is a psychoactive cannabinoid chemically similar to Delta-9 THC (the main intoxicant in marijuana) but less potent. Because it’s often hemp-derived, it exists in a legal gray area in some regions. Its effects are milder than traditional THC, relaxing but not overwhelming. Delta-10 THC liquid shares similarities with Delta-8 but tends to produce a more energetic, clear-headed effect. Some users compare it to the difference between sativa and indica cannabis strains, though individual experiences vary. HHC vape juice contains hexahydrocannabinol, a hydrogenated form of THC with slightly altered chemical properties. It’s moderately potent, with effects falling between Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC. Its stability makes it appealing for manufacturers, but long-term research is limited. THC-O and THC-P liquids are synthetic or semi-synthetic cannabinoids with significantly heightened potency. THC-O is estimated to be three times stronger than Delta-9 THC, while THC-P binds even more aggressively to receptors. These compounds lack extensive safety studies, and their effects can be unpredictable. Synthetic cannabinoids (like Spice or K2) are entirely lab-made chemicals designed to mimic THC. Unlike naturally derived compounds, these substances have been linked to severe health risks. Be cautious with these. When it comes to vaping, we know that variety is the spice of life. That’s why  Hipster Vapes has their signature C-Liquid line that offers six distinct flavors, each designed to deliver not just a taste, but an entire vibe, whether you're chasing a crisp, fruity rush or a deep, strain-inspired relaxation. From juicy blueberry bursts to the candy-like sweetness of Zkittlez, these flavors are more than just e-juice, they’re an express ticket to the kind of high you’re in the mood for. Remember, according to the manufacturer, that these are not intended for human consumption. Exercise caution. Let’s be real, walking into your local headshop isn’t always an option. Maybe you live in a small town where everyone knows everyone, or maybe you just value your privacy. Either way, the side-eyes from nosy neighbors or that awkward run-in with your boss’s cousin behind the counter? Hard pass. That’s where Express Highs changes the game. No crowded parking lots, no judgmental glances, just you, your screen, and the best damn selection of smoking gear and vape supplies delivered right to your door, no questions asked. Privacy isn’t just a buzzword here, it’s built into everything they do. From the second you click checkout to the moment your package lands on your doorstep, Express Highs keeps it completely discreet. No flashy logos, no \"HEY LOOK, I ORDERED A BONG\" packaging, just plain, unmarked boxes that blend in with everything else in your mailbox. Your business stays your business, period. And let’s not forget the real win: no more shuffling into some sketchy strip-mall smoke shop praying you don’t bump into your kid’s soccer coach while grabbing a new dab rig. But discretion isn’t the only reason this place kills the competition. Ever notice how local shops slap insane markups on glass and vapes just because they can? Express Highs doesn’t play that game. Their prices on bongs, dry herb vapes, cart batteries, and even premium e-juices are straight-up unbeatable. Whether you’re stocking up on nicotine salts for your pod system or hunting for a quartz banger that won’t crumble after two dabs, you’ll find it here for way less than those brick-and-mortar spots charging \"convenience\" fees. And if you think cheap means low-quality, think again, they only carry trusted brands, so you’re getting real deals, not knockoff junk. Speaking of variety, let’s talk about options. Local shops might have a dusty case of overpriced coils and three flavors of vape juice that expired last summer. Express Highs? Try hundreds of e-liquid flavors, from icy menthols to dessert-inspired nic salts, plus all the hardware to go with them. Pre-filled THC vapes? Check. Bulk CBD gummies? Obviously. They’ve even got those niche accessories you’d normally have to dig through five different sites to find, like replacement o-rings for your specific vape mod or that one specific glass adapter your rig desperately needs. At the end of the day, Express Highs gets it. They know you want quality without the markup, privacy without the paranoia, and convenience without the compromise. So yeah, maybe your local head shop has that one guy who swears he’ll \"hook you up,\" but let’s be honest, you’re getting a better deal, a better selection, and way better peace of mind staying home and letting Express Highs handle it. Shop in your sweatpants, not in shame. That’s the real win. Shop Express Highs today for your next favorite vape.

Email: [email protected] Name Email Subject Message Send Message Frequently Asked Questions Straightforward answers to the most common questions we receive about orders,\r\n    verification, shipping, and research products. Is Tracked Shipping Available? We provide tracked shipping exclusively to Canadian addresses. All other orders are dispatched using Standard Letter Mail, which does not include tracking. Nevertheless, we ensure our shipping is both swift and reliable. Need to Sign for the Package? A signature is not necessary upon delivery. Could You Explain Standard Letter Mail? Often referred to as \"Snail Mail,\" Standard Letter Mail is a traditional and commonly utilized method of postage. Your order is placed in a conventional envelope and sent with an attached postage stamp. Why Isn’t Tracking Available for Shipments to the United States? Shipments with tracking or expedited options are subjected to stricter verifications at borders, increasing the likelihood of seizure by customs. Our chosen method, Standard Letter Mail, may be somewhat slower, but has proven remarkably successful with no recorded order confiscations. Are Larger Orders Prone to Customs Issues? No, larger orders are partitioned into multiple packages to avoid such issues. This method has been unerringly successful and presents no additional risk for bulk orders. When Will Out-of-Stock Products Be Available Again? Restocking is continually in process, but acquiring certain products can present challenges. We genuinely appreciate your patience. Will New Products Be Introduced? Yes, we consistently enhance our catalog with new products. Should you have product recommendations, we encourage you to contact us via email. What if My Order Fails to Arrive? We are dedicated to exceptional customer service and evaluate situations such as these on an individual basis, ensuring efforts are made to resolve issues satisfactorily. Is the package discreet? Indeed, orders are dispatched in a standard, unembellished white envelope. Do You Provide Free Samples? We regret that we are unable to distribute free samples at this time. Are There Additional Products Available Beyond the Online Catalog? No, all available products are detailed within our online catalog. My Order Has Not Arrived After Two Weeks, What Should I Do?

LiftMode’s Kanna extract based products are produced with among the most potent and high-quality Kanna extracts available.  Kanna extracts are reputed to produce tranquil, cheerful and motivated states of mind, in part by supporting healthy serotonin levels. Kanna extracts may also help to support cognitive function and help work through mild occasional cravings.  – Boosts Mood – Reduces Stress – Promotes Tranquility  CAUTION: We strongly discourage combining Kanna with psychiatric prescription medications, including SSRIs, antipsychotics, or MAOIs, or with any other prescription or over the counter medicines that may significantly affect serotonin levels or the cardiovascular system (such as cough suppressant and decongestant medicines). There is a possibility of interactions with such combinations. Arctic Root Extract [≥5% Rosavins, ≥2% Salidroside] (Rhodiola rosea) Arctic Root Extract [≥5% Rosavins, ≥2% Salidroside] (Rhodiola rosea) Rhodiola rosea is an herbal extract used as an ingredient in dietary supplement products. It is said to prevent stress and fatigue, while also acting as a powerful antioxidant and to improve cognitive performance.   - Balances Stress - Boosts Cognition - Powerful Antioxidant Oroxylin A Oroxylin A Oroxylin A is a unique and cutting-edge plant compound, and of the primary flavonoids of *Scutellaria baicalensis* (Blue Skullcap). Flavones are active compounds known primarily for their antioxidant properties. The flavonoid compound Oroxylin A, is recognized today for its therapeutic effects in improving symptoms of stress, enhancing catecholamine production, and supporting memory.  - Boosts Levels of Catecholamines Dopamine and Norepinephrine - Antioxidant Properties - Unique and Cutting-Edge Plant Extract 7,8-Dihydroflavone 7,8-Dihydroflavone 7,8-DHF (7,8-Dihydroxyflavone) is a naturally occurring flavonoid with possible cognition-enhancing properties. Its recent discovery has spurred research into its unique properties.   By enhancing TrkB expression, 7,8-DHF may help to increase the rate new synapses are formed, thus enhancing learning. Some researchers hypothesize that 7,8-DHF does not bind TrkB directly, but instead acts on an unknown pathway that results in the same end result--increased TrkB activity. 7,8-DHF is believed to have a similar degree of neurogenic activities as BDNF.   On top of its effects on neurogenesis, 7,8-DHF is also neuroprotective. It has antioxidant properties in the brain that are independent of its TrkB activity. While these mechanisms are not understood, it is believed to activate the Akt/PKB pathway.   * Supports Healthy Memory and Focus * May Promote Adult Neurogenesis  * Neuroprotective and Antioxidant Triacetyluridine (TAU) Triacetyluridine (TAU) Triacetyluridine is a naturally-occurring compound and precursor to the nucleoside Uridine (pictured to the left). Uridine plays an important role in cellular signaling, and supports both CDP-Choline and dopamine levels in the brain. For this reason, Triacetyluridine is becoming a sought after dietary supplement for its perceived effect in boosting cognitive function, memory and mood.  - Promotes Healthy Memory and Cognition - Potent Neuroprotective Benefits - Supports a Positive Mood Mucuna Pruriens Extract Mucuna Pruriens Extract *Mucuna pruriens* is a tropical legume that is native to Africa and tropical Asia and has been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years. The primary active ingredient in *Mucuna pruriens* is an amino acid referred to as L-Dopa (or levodopa) which can also be bio-synthesized from L-Tyrosine.  L-Dopa is a natural precursor to dopamine, but can also help promote healthy levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine as well, which can be used to facilitate boosted learning, improved mood, increased energy, effective stress management, and even natural boosts in libido.   L-Dopa also has the natural ability to pass the blood-brain barrier, allowing for healthy hormone production in the brain; showing an effective potential for a powerful and regenerative boost in brain health.   - Improves Mood - Sharpens Focus - Promotes Healthy Libido Organic Gum Base Organic Gum Base Gum base is what gives chewing gum its “chew.” It is made of a combination of food-grade polymers, waxes and softeners that give gum the texture desired by consumers and enable it to effectively deliver sweetness, flavor and various other benefits, including dental benefits. A polymer is a string of molecules (monomers) that usually contain carbon and hydrogen. Polymers are found naturally in the human body, animals, plants, and minerals. For example, DNA is a polymer, as are the proteins and starches in the foods we eat. In chewing gum, polymers are what provide gum with its basic elastic properties. Chewing gum may help reduce stress and boost memory. Chewing gum while performing tasks may help improve various aspects of brain function. Organic gum base has great mechanical strength, good barrier qualities, and antibacterial or germ resistance. Xylitol Xylitol Xylitol is a natural compound that can be found in a variety of plants, vegetables and fruits, including strawberries, raspberries, plums, mushrooms, cauliflower, birch bark, corn husks, rice, oat, wheat husks, birch and beechwood. Xylitol has wide-spread usage as a natural sweetener for culinary practices. Xylitol has a sweetness that is similar to regular sugar; but contains up to 40% less calories and is generally known to not have any of the harmful effects of sugar.   - Healthy Circulatory System - Promotes Healthy Teeth - Strengthens Bones Natural Cinnamon Flavor Natural Cinnamon Flavor Extracts from the bark as well as leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots of the cinnamon tree. Cinnamon is high in antioxidants, which may help protect against disease, inflammation, and aging. Cinnamon may help improve insulin response, which may help your body regulate blood sugar levels. Cinnamon may help reduce overall cholesterol levels. Cinnamon may help soothe the stomach. Cinnamon may help improve gut health. Cinnamon may help improve dental hygiene. Cinnamon also contains potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which may help with blood pressure, heart rate, and skeletal health. Food Grade Silica Food Grade Silica Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is a naturally occurring compound made of silicon and oxygen. It has many uses. Silicon dioxide is used as an anti-caking agent and flow aid in powdered foods and supplements. It can also be used to preserve color and carry flavors and fragrances. Silicon dioxide is found in many plant foods, including barley, oats, wheat, rice, carrots, potatoes, green beans, apples, and bananas. Sorbitan Monostearate Sorbitan Monostearate Sorbitan monostearate is used as an emulsifier, helps yeast retain moisture and extend its shelf life, prevents ice crystals and promotes emulsification, improves volume and texture, stabilizes the emulsion of fats and oils and keeps oil and water mixed together.

Kanna extracts contain several important alkaloids. For purposes of nomenclature, scientists have bestowed the best known of the Kanna-derived alkaloids with the prefix: “mesembr-”. The most important alkaloids include: Mesembrine Mesembrenone delta-7 Mesembrenone Mesembrenol Mesembranol Kanna Extract powder is known by a number of alternative names, including: Sceletium tortuosum Mesembryanthemum tortuosum Channa Kougoed Mesmebrine Mesembrenone Mesembryanthemaceae S.tortuosum MT55 Extract Sceletium Scientific Consensus An extremely long history of use suggests that using the fermented plant is safe and effective, but does not provide absolute proof. Further, very few studies have been conducted using a strong Kanna Extract powder. More research is needed to fully understand the significance of the benefits and adverse effects of this supplement. There is not enough research about the safety of Kanna Extract powder for pregnant and breastfeeding women. LIFTMODE NEVER USES FILLERS OR EXCIPIENTS!

Vous y trouverez des dab rigs, des pipes à eau, des boîtes de stockage et toute une série d’articles. À Savoir Qu’est-ce qu’un headshop  ? Un headshop est un point de vente qui vend des accessoires pour fumer du cannabis et du tabac, comme des feuilles, des pipes et des bangs. Selon l’endroit où vous vous trouvez dans le monde, certains headshops vendent aussi légalement des substances psychoactives comme du kratom ou d’autres herbes légales. Chez Zamnesia, nous gérons une boutique en ligne qui sert de source d’accessoires pour la plupart des pays d’Europe. En plus d’offrir tout l’équipement standard, nous vendons également des produits haut de gamme comme des vaporisateurs, et gérons même un Vaporshop spécialisé. Pourquoi Le Nom De « Headshop » ? Les origines exactes du terme « headshop » restent obscures. Toutefois, l’une des nombreuses théories populaires détient probablement la vérité. Certains pensent que le mot « head » est l’acronyme de « He Eats Acid Daily ». D’autres proposent que le terme ait probablement des liens avec la description de « pothead ». Insatisfaits de ces réponses, d’autres s’interrogent sur le lien avec le célèbre groupe de rock américain The Grateful Dead. Leurs fidèles fans sont connus sous le nom de « Deadheads », et une énorme culture psychédélique tourne autour du groupe. Histoire Des Headshops Les headshops ont vu le jour dans les années 1960, alimentés par la contre-culture psychédélique de l’époque. Des dizaines de psychonautes universitaires ont alimenté la croissance de ces entreprises dans des zones comme West Los Angeles, San Francisco et Chicago Old Town. Au début, les headshops étaient fortement liés aux mouvements hippie et anti-guerre du Vietnam, ainsi qu’à des groupes militant pour la légalisation du cannabis. Tout comme aujourd’hui, ces headshops de première génération vendaient une grande variété d’accessoires controversés, allant de l’attirail pour fumeurs et des magazines aux sex toys et à l’art psychédélique. Le mouvement des headshops a commencé à s’essouffler à la suite de l’interdiction des accessoires en 1973. Cependant, à l’ère moderne, les headshops sont de retour en force. Les headshops modernes proposent des produits de haute technologie dont les fumeurs des années 60 ne pouvaient qu'imaginer dans leurs rêves. Quels Sont Les Meilleurs Accessoires Pour Fumer Du Cannabis? Les « meilleurs » accessoires pour fumer du cannabis restent un sujet subjectif. Chaque fumeur aura des préférences en ce qui concerne les produits essentiels qu’il utilise fréquemment. Chez Zamnesia, nous avons une très bonne idée de l’équipement le plus important dans la boîte à outils du fumeur. Bien qu’ils varient en termes de couleur, de taille et de fonction, tous les clients peuvent bénéficier des produits ci-dessous pour garantir une séance réussie. À Savoir Comment devriez-vous fumer de l’herbe ? Nous recommandons de commencer avec des joints ou de simples vaporisateurs . Ensuite, vous pouvez passer au dabbing , bangs et à des vaporisateurs plus sophistiqués. Support Pour Votre Herbe : Feuille, Pipes À Fumer, Bangs Avant tout, il faut un équipement qui permette de fumer du cannabis. Chaque fumeur a des préférences différentes et les headshops les satisferont tous. Choisissez parmi les feuilles à rouler , les cônes pré-roulés, les blunts, les pipes en verre (spoon pipe), les pipes à eau, les dab rigs, les bongs , les bubbles et les vaporisateurs. Grinder Les grinders pour herbe sont une pièce essentielle du kit. Plutôt que de mettre de gros morceaux de têtes dans une douille ou un joint, les grinders créent des granulés fins qui sont beaucoup plus faciles à manipuler. Choisissez parmi des matériaux comme l’acrylique, le bois et le métal. Les grinders simples sont dotés d’une seule chambre, tandis que les modèles plus complexes offrent plusieurs chambres et des plateaux de récupération du kief. Briquet À moins que vous ne prévoyiez d’utiliser le soleil et une loupe, ne pensez même pas à fumer de l’herbe sans un briquet fiable. Vous n’obtiendrez pas grand-chose sans en avoir un. Choisissez parmi les briquets Clipper, simples mais fonctionnels, ou les briquets torches, plus impressionnants et plus tape-à-l’œil. Machine à rouler La plupart des fumeurs de cannabis aiment le processus rituel du roulage. D’autres, toutefois, préfèrent rationaliser le processus avec des machines à rouler. Il suffit d’ajouter de l’herbe et une feuille, et ces appareils produisent un joint magnifiquement fait en quelques secondes. Boite De Stockage Les boîtes de stockage ( cachettes secrètes ) permettent de conserver tous vos objets de valeur dans un endroit facilement accessible. Choisissez parmi des modèles petits et simples, adaptés pour contenir votre briquet et vos feuilles, ou essayez des offres plus exotiques qui peuvent stocker tout votre matériel — et qui ont l’air d’être camouflées sur votre étagère. Plateau De Roulage Les plateaux de roulage empêchent les particules d’herbes de se répandre sur votre tapis. Si vous avez déjà roulé un joint sans plateau, vous savez à quel point les choses peuvent être salissantes. Utilisez un plateau de roulage pour garder les choses propres et faire durer votre réserve plus longtemps. Cendrier Les cendriers sont essentiels pour garder les braises et les cendres, et pour empêcher que vos vêtements et votre tapis ne soient brûlés de temps en temps. Notre headshop vend une grande variété de cendriers, allant de simples pièces en acier inoxydable à des options très décoratives et comiques. À Savoir Où pouvez-vous vous trouver les produits du headshop ? Les clients peuvent se rendre dans les headshops en personne. Toutefois, les headshops en ligne comme Zamnesia proposent une large gamme de produits que vous pouvez consulter dans le confort de votre maison. MATÉRIEL POUR ROULER Utilisé depuis le XVIe siècle, les feuilles à rouler constituent l’épine dorsale de l’industrie des headshop. Toutefois, au fil des ans, l’humble feuille à rouler s’est transformé en une gamme de feuilles, de tailles, de matériaux, et de motifs différents, ainsi que plusieurs options pour les filtres et les cartons. Si vous n’avez pas encore appris l’art de rouler, vous pouvez aussi trouver des machines à rouler et des cônes pré-roulés pour garder le plaisir de rouler — peu importe votre niveau de compétence. Ne risquez pas de perdre votre sang-froid, vos feuilles ou votre grinder en investissant dans notre fantastique sélection de plateaux de roulage. Nous avons même des options haut de gamme dotées de caractéristiques de haute technologie pour une expérience de roulage ultime, avec différentes formes et styles. Restez organisé avec un plateau de roulage pour chaque situation. Les grinders sont une nécessité fondamentale - vous ne pouvez pas placer de têtes géantes à l’intérieur d’un joint bien serré. C’est pourquoi nous avons des grinders conçus pour convenir à tous les budgets, en métal, plastique, acrylique, et autres matériaux. Même si vous voulez un grinder simplement pour le look, plutôt que pour la fon"

GROWTH FACTORS/PEPTIDES Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) are a class of peptides that have piqued the interest of bodybuilders due to their ability to increase the synthesis and release of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. It can aid in muscle building and stimulate fat reduction. It accomplishes this by inducing the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1, in turn, stimulates muscle protein synthesis and growth. It also appears to indirectly enhance body fat's breakdown. Reviews for buying products & contact with us Better yet, see us in person!

Email Address Sign up PURITY & QUALITY PURITY & QUALITY What are Underdoglabs quality control standards? What are Underdoglab™\"s quality control standards? Here at Underdoglabs™, all of our products are manufactured only in GMP-certified facilities and are Pharmaceutical grade. GMP refers to the Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administrations under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. underdoglabs™ Lifescience goes one step further by using advanced analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, to ensure our products meet label claims for potency and purity. Underdoglabs™ tests its products using US Pharmacopeia and other exacting pharmaceutical assay standards. Finally, a Certificate of Analysis (COA) guaranteeing every one of our products’ quality, potency, and purity is kept on file and available. For more information please download the COA on every product page. We believe the quality of our products is finest, hereby we fully stand by our products & offer full refund as our guarantee program. What does Underdoglabs™ do to ensure the quality of its products? FDA registered, USA based analytical testing laboratories are used for all of our product testing. Each batch is first tested by manufacturer & double tested by us in laboratory and COA (certificate of analysis) is released on the basis of lab tests. Only after our Director of Quality Control determines the materials are compliant and per specifications, are they inventoried and made available for production. Some of our key laboratory procedures and objectives are: • Advanced analytical methods for testing the quality and efficacy of products. • Documentation of Certificate of Analysis for every product. • Procedures that follow industry-standard methodologies such as ASTM, ISO, as well as US, European, and Japanese Pharmacopoeia. • 3rd Party laboratory testing. The bottom line is we are fully commited to assuring our customers receive only the finest and purest ingredients. What's the difference between tablets, capsules and Powder? Material inside the capsules are exactly as same as powder form with same potency. It is better to intake in powdered form if one is taking more than one supplement. Powdered form have more bioavailability and better absorbed by body. If you want a capsule form, a person can buy empty gelatin capsules and fill the powder himself and save big bucks. How does the underdoglabs offers best price on Supplements online? In an industry with traditionally high mark-ups, we offer the same pure supplements in bulk, directly to the consumer at a fair price. Why is our products cheaper? Direct Import: We are the direct importer of Nutraceuticals products from USA, Europe & other countries. Direct Selling: We do not have any \"Middle Men\" or traditional distribution chain which unnecessarily increases the price of the product, we sell our products directly to our end consumers.

ENERGY MOOD RELAX SLEEP MEMORY FOCUS STAMINA DIET DETOX VITALITY IMMUNO LIBIDO Join our satisfied customers! elizei NOOPEPTIL™ MAX, 07.04.2022 This is my favorite product of all these I've ordered so far. It has helped my brain to function efficiently after years of neglect, and I feel physically motivated to do things, both in everyday activities and during more intense periods such as exam sessions at university. adadudi MEMOSTIM™ MAX, 19.11.2020 My adventure with Swiss Herbal began with a friend who recommended it to me and then ordered Memostim along with his own order. To this day, I am grateful to him. He helped me a lot in achieving my goals (mainly Memostim, although my friend indirectly helped too :D). When I describe its (again, Memostim's :D) effects to my friends, I say this: sometimes you think it would be good to do something productive – vacuum, clean up, plan your week, exercise. Memostim makes you take these thoughts seriously much more often and get into action. That's how it is for me. I recommend it. Bartass89 NOOPEPTIL™ MAX, 29.04.2020 I drank a lot of alcohol, but since I started taking it, I became smarter, gave up alcohol, my brain worked faster and more efficiently, and processed information more quickly. I joined a gym, gained new qualifications, learned about nutrition in a very thorough way, analyzing every aspect without getting tired. I should add that I am a melancholic person, so my personality is helpful for this. You can think very intensely and your brain doesn't “wear out” in the process. I finished the supplementation in mid-January, and to this day I can say that it works about 75%, so there is definitely a difference compared to before I started taking it. Maybe it makes you too “serious” and analytical and less inclined to joke around, but it's definitely a big plus. Reading corner Publications 29 December 2025 Telomeres – a key to an infinite life?

ENERGY MOOD RELAX SLEEP MEMORY FOCUS STAMINA DIET DETOX VITALITY IMMUNO LIBIDO Join our satisfied customers! elizei NOOPEPTIL™ MAX, 07.04.2022 This is my favorite product of all these I've ordered so far. It has helped my brain to function efficiently after years of neglect, and I feel physically motivated to do things, both in everyday activities and during more intense periods such as exam sessions at university. adadudi MEMOSTIM™ MAX, 19.11.2020 My adventure with Swiss Herbal began with a friend who recommended it to me and then ordered Memostim along with his own order. To this day, I am grateful to him. He helped me a lot in achieving my goals (mainly Memostim, although my friend indirectly helped too :D). When I describe its (again, Memostim's :D) effects to my friends, I say this: sometimes you think it would be good to do something productive – vacuum, clean up, plan your week, exercise. Memostim makes you take these thoughts seriously much more often and get into action. That's how it is for me. I recommend it. Bartass89 NOOPEPTIL™ MAX, 29.04.2020 I drank a lot of alcohol, but since I started taking it, I became smarter, gave up alcohol, my brain worked faster and more efficiently, and processed information more quickly. I joined a gym, gained new qualifications, learned about nutrition in a very thorough way, analyzing every aspect without getting tired. I should add that I am a melancholic person, so my personality is helpful for this. You can think very intensely and your brain doesn't “wear out” in the process. I finished the supplementation in mid-January, and to this day I can say that it works about 75%, so there is definitely a difference compared to before I started taking it. Maybe it makes you too “serious” and analytical and less inclined to joke around, but it's definitely a big plus. Reading corner Publications 29 December 2025 Telomeres – a key to an infinite life?

Although Sunifiram a Piracetam analogue, its chemical structure does not contain a pyrrolidinone ring and therefore it is not strictly speaking a member of the racetam family. Although Sunifiram is a relatively new nootropic, initial research is promising and suggests that it is a stimulatory nootropic with anti-amnesiac and cognitive enhancing properties. It has also been shown to be virtually non-toxic. INGREDIENTS One tablet consists of 10mg Sunifiram. A package contains 20, 40, 100 or 200 capsules. SUITABLE FOR Vegetarians and vegans DIRECTIONS Recommendations vary, however most sources suggest 5 and 10mg per day. Sunifiram is water soluble and therefore does not need to be taken with a meal.

Long story why we sell intermediate and not fosigotifator itself is below in description. IUPAC Name: 2-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenoxy)-N-[4-[[2-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]-3-hydroxy-1-bicyclo[2.2.2]octanyl]acetamide SMILES: OC1CC2(CCC1(CC2)NC(=O)COc3ccc(Cl)c(F)c3)NC(=O)COc4ccc(Cl)c(F)c4 CAS: 2144474-93-9 Fosigotifator Intermediate 11 Choose an option 1 g 10 g 5 g 500 mg 1 g 10 g 5 g 500 mg Clear Fosigotifator (ABBV-CLS-7262) Intermediate 11 quantity Add to cart Description This is arguably one of the most ambitious projects our team has ever undertaken. Synthesizing this intermediate required an enormous amount of time and effort, especially considering war impact on conditions of our work. Why are we selling the intermediate instead of the final Fosigotifator? We deliberately chose not to perform the last two stages of the synthesis. These steps do not affect the bioactivity of the final compound – they only influence its water solubility. However, completing them is economically impractical: the final two steps each have a yield of about 50% ; the separation of the chiral alcohol via chiral HPLC gives another ~50% yield ; considering the starting material costs around $900 per gram , the combined yields (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5) mean that 1 gram of the intermediate produces about 0.125 g of Fosigotifator ; once you add labor, flash chromatography of the final compound, and chiral chromatography to separate the isomers, the final price would increase by 10-12× . Because of this, routine production of the final Fosigotifator is not economically viable. Can we produce the final Fosigotifator? Yes. For customers who specifically need the finished compound, we can carry out the complete synthesis upon request under custom synthesis terms. Cost and timelines depend on the required quantity and purity.

Bromantane is a widely used in research atypical psychostimulant and anxiolytic. Chemically it is a derivative of adamantine with interesting pharmacological profile. The drug was developed, like many nootropics, in Russia, for the treatment of neurasthenia. Unfortunately (or fortunately), most scientific works are Russian, what may cause some skepticism. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but there are some prerequisites. As befits ancient Russian studies, the effects of bromantane were established purely statistically. The drug has established itself as an atypical psychostimulant and anxiolytic. Researches speculate that it is a dopamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor and / or releaser. To less extent, the same is observed with norepinephrine. Drug increases the strength of the alpha rhythm and reduces the strength of the beta and delta rhythms. This partly proves its stimulating effect. The alpha rhythm is detected during training and normal wakefulness of a person. In the transition from wrestling to sleep, the alpha rhythm is replaced by the sigma rhythm, followed by theta waves. During light sleep, a delta rhythm is observed. The beta rhythm is a kind of calm state during wakefulness, it is also observed while taking GABA-A agonsits and other drugs that increase inhibitory neurotransmission. Also, the beta rhythm occurs during the rapid (REM) phase of sleep. Thus, due to its peculiar effect on the electrical rhythms of the brain and an increase in the volume of working memory, bromantane is believed to gieve a productive state for performing various mental work. In previous articles, we briefly mentioned long-term potentiation of signal transmission (also known as LTP). So, there is still a short-term potentiation, which is enhanced by the hero of today’s review. This is achieved through intricate mechanisms of influence on the synthesis of messenger RNA and dopamine neurotransmission, however, it is not planned to review these phenomena in detail within the framework of this article, but since we are talking about RNA, it would be a sin not to note that bromantane increases the expression of enzymes that synthesize dopamine. Due to an indirect increase in the synthesis of dopamine, the drug reduces the systemic amount of prolactin, which may be of interest to users using antipsychotics and bodybuilding. Bromantane reduces the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (both in the central nervous system and in the periphery), due to which it may be appropriate during all sorts of depression and inflammatory diseases. Well, cherry on the cake – this drug releases neurotrophic factors.

These sheets of paper contain specific modulated doses of Lysergamides absorbed into their fibers and can be used as an efficient means of delivery for experimentation, research, and laboratory use. LSD Blotters are a class of research chemicals that include several compounds known for their activity and interaction related to serotonin and dopamine pathways of the body as active psychedelic and hallucinogenic compounds. These compounds are, by nature, amides of the lysergic acid, and there are around 40 compounds present in this class. SPECIFICATIONS BLOTTERS Blotters are available from the RealChems website in the form of individual dosage slices and sheets. The chemicals provided as blotters are of interest to the scientific community due to the potential therapeutic activity of the compounds for disorders related to the body’s serotonin and dopamine pathways.

Like, what gives a cryptocurrency its value? Why bother with this funny Internet money when you transfer some cash from your PayPal account? By the end of this page, you’ll understand the value of crypto. Not only will you know what a cryptocurrency is and how to make a transaction, but you’ll also know why you might want a crypto wallet sooner than later. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. A cryptocurrency is a combination of two beneficial technologies: money and cryptography. Have you ever come across a CAPTCHA? Y’know, when you’re on a website, they ask you to click on pictures with motorcycles to prove you’re not a bot? That’s cryptography in action. Cryptography works in the background to ensure our messaging apps are secure against third-parties snooping. Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies secured by similar privacy and security protocols. It’s essentially cryptography applied to money and exchange. But wait – how exactly do you create money from nothing? Even if the “nothing” is a bunch of computer code. Why do cryptocurrencies have value? This page explains how to make a cryptocurrency transaction. But first, we’ll provide some background on the technology itself. If you want to cut to the chase, use the subheadings to find your specific concern. Key takeaways A cryptocurrency is a digital asset on a network distributed across millions of computers. Similar to “Napster” or other P2P file-sharing sites. Governments and music labels couldn’t stop people from downloading music because the app structure was too decentralized. They would have had to purge the world of computers to prevent people from sharing music. Likewise, cryptocurrencies can exist outside the control of governments and banks or other central authorities. Decentralized systems don’t fall apart at a single point of failure. Cryptocurrencies can provide cheaper and faster money transfers, especially without third-party authentication and security fees. Security is built right into the system. Transacting with cryptos is as easy as downloading an app on your phone. If you’re just looking to make a few transactions, nothing huge, then start by opening an account on a platform like Coinbase. Verify your identity, and you’re off to the races! No need for a digital wallet or any prior crypto knowledge! Why is cryptocurrency valuable? Today, we have bank cards that represent paper money. Paper money used to be redeemable in gold and silver. Gold and silver were valuable because people valued using them in jewelry. Whatever people use as money has always had an origin from something worthwhile. Except for cryptocurrencies… or so it seems. Many don’t realize cryptocurrency is both a currency and a payment system. The payment system is the source of its value. But even crypto enthusiasts have trouble with this concept so let’s dig in a little deeper. Technological limitations have always separated currencies from their payment systems. When you wire money worldwide, you need to rely on third parties. And you have to trust those third parties just as they have to trust you. That’s why cryptocurrencies were invented – to get around this reliance on third parties. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, said of his invention: “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.” In other words: the innovation stems from how the payment network works. The coin or digital currency unit can only express the network’s value. A cryptocurrency coin is an accounting tool. The usefulness of cryptocurrency comes from its payment network. This is called a blockchain. What is the “blockchain”? Blockchain technology makes cryptocurrencies possible. It is a distributed ledger that is essentially a database shared and synchronized across space and accessible by multiple people. It gives transactions public “witnesses” instead of a centralized ledger that relies on financial institutions or third parties. The blockchain ledger lives in the cloud. Observed by anyone at any time and monitored by its users, the blockchain allows for the transferring of bits of information from one person to another. These information bits are like digitally-secured property titles. Nakamoto called them “digital signatures.” The blockchain verifies these digital signatures without depending on a third-party trust agency. An Internet ledger everybody has access to is helpful. It records the amounts, the time, and the public address of every transaction. The blockchain guarantees the integrity of the system. The currency unit is merely a digital form of a property title. The real star of the show is the blockchain. The value of cryptocurrencies isn’t embedded in digital coins but in the payment network. If somehow cryptocurrencies abandoned the blockchain, the value of the digital coins would plummet to zero. The reason for this is that the blockchain isn’t just about money. The blockchain is the perfect invention for transferring information that requires security, confirmations, or assurances of authenticity. It diminishes the potential for human error. Hierarchical structures are replaced by peer-to-peer technology. In an economy that runs off contracts and exchanges, having algorithms guarnetee trust and security is like… well, it’s like giving up your CDs for a smartphone with an app that streams music for free. Who uses crypto? If you listen to those who have the most to lose from cryptocurrencies, only criminals and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs profit from it. But this is patently false. Cryptocurrency adoption is widespread in developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the countries of the European Union. Likewise, emerging economies in Africa have adopted cryptocurrencies. A recent survey suggested that 33 percent of Nigerians owned crypto. Residents in India, China, and Brazil have all adopted cryptocurrencies to transfer money across borders without unnecessary expenses. The United States and Canada have a pro-crypto attitude. Many countries sweep cryptos under the regulatory rug when enforcing fraud and anti-money laundering rules. Not so for the Americans and Canadians. European Union member states have traditionally been less warm in their reception. However, that is changing as the EU governments and parliament have reached an agreement on cryptocurrency regulation. In most places, governments tax cryptocurrencies as capital gains. Cryptocurrencies are illegal in Algeria, Egypt, Bangladesh, China (for residents, as of September 2021), and North Macedonia (the only European country with a complete prohibition). Colombian citizens can own crypto, but the country’s financial institutions are forbidden from involving themselves. Who accepts crypto? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are accepted by companies like Paypal, Microsoft, Wikipedia, and even Home Depot (America’s largest home improvement retailer). And, of course, we at RealChems accept cryptocurrency as payment. Why should you use crypto? There are several benefits to using crypto. Protect Your Assets – Crypto’s decentralized structure means your assets aren’t susceptible to a third-party trust relationship. When trading, you can keep what you earn. There’s no middleman fee. Protect Against Theft – Transactions are validated and recorded in a public ledger. Identities are encrypted. Protect Against Inflation – Despite their volatility, cryptos have retained their value while inflation reaches record highs. Cryptos can serve as a financial cushion in an uncertain world. Secure and Transparent – Cryptos are public and private where it counts. Public enough to ensure the payment network remains honest. But private enough to secure your identity. How and where to buy crypto? To buy cryptocurrency, you must find a broker or a crypto exchange. (You can also mine cryptos, but that’ll lead us down a rabbit hole on what “mining” crypto even is. Besides, one needs tremendous computing power and the resources to do it, so it isn’t worth the effort for basic transactions.) A crypto exchange is a platform where buyers and sellers meet to trade cryptocurrencies. They are similar to online brokerage platforms. The most popular is Coinbase and Gemini, but you can choose from plenty of others. The problem with cryptocurrency exchanges is that governments don’t regulate them. So, in case of a hack or unforeseen event, people with cryptos in these exchanges could lose their money. Crypto exchanges tend to market toward beginners and, therefore, charge higher fees than if you went another route. A crypto broker takes the complexity out of the process. Robinhood and SoFi are two of the most well-known crypto brokers. Like a “regular” broker, a crypto broker is a middleman between you, the consumer, and the cryptocurrency exchange. If you don’t mind paying a small service fee, using a crypto broker is a great way to enter the field without much prior knowledge. Once signed up to a brokerage or a crypto exchange, you can deposit money into your account. With money in your account, you can purchase cryptocurrencies. And don’t worry if you can’t afford whatever the price of bitcoin is currently at. You can buy fractional amounts, for example, 1/100 millionth of a bitcoin. The ten biggest cryptos on the market right now are: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT) Binance Coin (BNB) Cardano (ADA) Dogecoin (DOGE) XRP (XRP) Solana (SOL) U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) Uniswap (UNI) Some things to keep in mind when buying crypto through a broker or exchange: You’ll have to verify your identification. This is to prevent fraud and meet government regulatory requirements. A crypto platform may ask for a copy of your driver’s licence or passport. Some credit card companies process cryptocurrency transactions as cash advances. So if you transfer money from a credit card to a crypto exchange, be wary of higher interest rates and cash advance fees from your bank. Where should I store my crypto? You have a few options: a crypto exchange, a digital wallet, or a physical wallet. We recommend a digital or physical wallet for security reasons. But if you’re dipping your toes in the crypto world and don’t have a large balance, then there’s nothing wrong with leaving crypto on the exchange. For more information on this, see How To Make a Crypto Wallet. How to make a cryptocurrency transaction Finally! We’ve covered almost everything there is to know about cryptocurrencies. Now, we can get to the crux of the issue. How do you use these freaking things!? Let’s say you’ve got some crypto on an exchange or stored in a wallet. Now what? The most straightforward transaction is simply exchanging one cryptocurrency for another. You can do this from the comfort of the crypto exchange or notify your broker. When you’re looking to cash out, you can use an online kiosk designed for converting cryptos into your local currency. But say you want to buy something with crypto? You can transfer between digital wallets. All you need to make the transaction is to have the blockchain address for the wallet you’re sending the money to. If using bitcoin, the address will look something like this: 1FtjAzGKSyAavUkbw5QsyzzNDKdtPXk95D Each address links to a particular user or the location of a specific wallet. Every crypto address is unique as it represents the location of a wallet on the blockchain. Crypto addresses are public, but the person or wallet behind the address remains anonymous. Individuals send cryptocurrency to a crypto address, like how you can send regular currency to email addresses. But first, you need the address of the wallet you’re sending money to. Or, vice-versa, the person trying to send you crypto needs your wallet address (or address on the exchange). Because crypto addresses are long and randomized, people have adopted QR codes for easy transactions and communication. These QR codes representing crypto addresses are safe to advertise since they are protected from theft. A crypto address is a “public key.” A public key is one of two keys used in cryptography. The key used for decryption is different from the one used for encryption. Or in other words, I can send you money to your blockchain address, but I cannot use that address to steal from your digital wallet. In summary: how to make a cryptocurrency transaction If you know how to download an app on your phone, you can get started with cryptocurrency and make a transaction. That’s how easy it is. The difficulty with crypto comes from understanding what it is and why it has value. We hope you’ve learned something today. And if you’d like more information on getting a cryptocurrency wallet and transacting with it instead of relying on brokerages or coin exchanges, please check out How To Make a Crypto Wallet. It should answer any other questions you may have.

OUR PRODUCTS Top Nootropics Categories Cholinergic Nootropics: Enhance Memory and Learning with High‑Purity Supplements Eugeroic Nootropics for Wakefulness, Focus, and Mental Clarity Glutamatergic Nootropics for Learning, Focus, and Neuroplasticity Neuroprotective Nootropics – Support Brain Health and Longevity Nootropic Powders: Flexible Cognitive Enhancement with High‑Purity Supplements Solutions: Nootropic Liquids & Sprays for Serious Researchers Discover Our Nootropic Categories Variety is key to finding the perfect chemicals for your needs. That’s why our catalog covers multiple categories, each tailored to support specific aspects of research. Below, we introduce our main categories and link to the corresponding product pages so you can explore in depth. Neuroprotective Nootropis Protecting your brain cells is just as important as boosting performance. Our neuroprotective nootropic chemicals are designed to help safeguard neurons against oxidative stress, inflammation and age‑related decline. This category includes compounds like emoxypine succinate, known for its antioxidant properties, and NSI‑189, a research peptide believed to support neurogenesis. We also carry 9‑Me‑BC, a benzimidazole derivative thought to stimulate the growth of nerve cells. Each product page offers detailed information on how these compounds may protect and support brain health. Visit: Explore Neuroprotective Nootropics A healthy brain isn’t just about sharp thinking; it’s about resilience. Our neuroprotective formulas focus on promoting longevity and recovery. If you’re conducting research on neurodegenerative diseases or simply want to support long‑term brain health, this category is a must‑visit. You’ll find powders and solutions that blend seamlessly into your existing regimen, whether you’re studying them in isolation or stacking them with other compounds. With Euro Nootropics, you can trust that every neuroprotective compound has been tested for purity and potency. Cholinergics If memory and learning are your priorities, look no further than our cholinergic collection. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for encoding and recalling information, and cholinergic nootropics are designed to increase its availability in the brain. Our lineup features classic racetams like piracetam, aniracetam and pramiracetam, as well as choline donors like alpha‑GPC and citicoline (CDP‑Choline). These compounds are often praised for their ability to enhance memory recall, sharpen focus and improve verbal fluency. For a modern twist, explore Fasoracetam and Dihexa – two cholinergic agents gaining popularity for their novel mechanisms and potential mood‑boosting effects. Visit: Browse Cholinergics What makes our cholinergic category stand out is the depth of information provided. Each product description includes research citations, dosage recommendations for laboratory work and guidance on potential side effects. If you’re new to cholinergics, start with a classic racetam and pair it with a choline donor to optimize results. For the seasoned researcher, advanced compounds like coluracetam or sunifiram offer a unique twist on cholinergic modulation. Whatever your level of experience, our cholinergic range offers flexibility and quality you can count on. Glutamatergic & Ampakine chemicals These substances target glutamate receptors, which are pivotal for synaptic plasticity – the process by which your brain forms and strengthens connections. Our selection includes ampakines like Sunifiram and Unifiram, which modulate AMPA receptors to potentially enhance memory and alertness. You’ll also find Nooglutyl, an NMDA receptor modulator, and memantine hydrochloride, widely researched for its neuroprotective properties. These products are particularly interesting for researchers studying learning, memory formation and neurodegenerative conditions. Visit: Discover Glutamatergic & Ampakine Using glutamatergic and ampakine compounds requires a bit of finesse. They’re powerful tools, but dosage and timing matter. On our product pages, you’ll find detailed instructions on how to handle these chemicals in a research setting. From recommended stacking protocols to potential interactions, our comprehensive guides help you make informed decisions. If you’re seeking compounds that deliver noticeable cognitive benefits quickly, this category is a treasure trove. High‑Purity Nootropic Powders For researchers and enthusiasts who appreciate flexibility, our nootropic powder products offer complete control over dosing and formulation. Powdered chemicals make it easy to measure precise amounts, blend multiple compounds or create custom stacks. Our powder category includes well‑known racetams like oxiracetam, phenylpiracetam and pramiracetam, as well as unique compounds such as bromantane, cyclazodone and etifoxine. These powders dissolve easily in various solvents, making them versatile for laboratory experiments. Visit: Shop Nootropic Powders When you choose Euro Nootropics powders, you’re selecting products that have been finely milled and tested for purity down to the molecule. Many of our customers appreciate the ability to adjust dosage precisely – whether they’re titrating to find an optimal level or combining complementary compounds. Powders also tend to offer better value per dose compared to capsules or tablets. With clear labeling and dosing guidelines, our powders deliver both quality and convenience. Nootropic Solutions for Research Liquid formulations provide quick absorption and precise dosing. Our nootropic solutions category features ready‑to‑use liquids like semax acetate, cerebrolysin and nicergoline. These products are perfect for laboratory settings where accurate measurement and speedy administration are key. Solutions can be administered sublingually, intranasally or as needed based on your research design. Each bottle is prepared in a sterile environment, ensuring stability and consistency. Visit: View Nootropic Solutions One of the advantages of liquid nootropics is their rapid onset of action. Compounds like semax and selank are absorbed through mucous membranes, delivering benefits faster than oral powders. Our solutions come in amber glass bottles to protect against light degradation and include dropper caps for easy dosing. If you value convenience and precision, our nootropic solutions deserve a place in your research toolkit. GABAergics GABAergic compounds act on the brain’s γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system—the primary inhibitory network that stabilizes neuronal firing. They typically target GABA_A ionotropic receptors (chloride channels) or GABA_B metabotropic receptors (GPCRs), or they modulate GABA levels via transporters and enzymes involved in synthesis/catabolism. In research settings, GABAergics are used to probe circuit inhibition, oscillations, synaptic plasticity, and excitation–inhibition balance, providing controlled ways to study anxiety-like behavior, seizure thresholds, and network synchronization Get Free Worldwide Shipping on Online Orders Above 99€ Discover our Products Our Guarantee: Purity and Transparency At Euro Nootropics, we take your trust seriously. That’s why every product you purchase comes with a guarantee of authenticity and purity. We source our compounds from vetted manufacturers who comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

Scoops are highly unreliable for accurate measuring. Mama didn't raise no fool! Scoops measure volume rather than weight, which is problematic because all powders have different densities. You wouldn't use a spoon to weigh yourself, would you? A milligram scale is needed to accurately measure powder products. Tools set us apart from the animals. WARNING: Keep all supplements out of reach of children. Kids are short and stupid, so that should be easy for you. Do not take any supplement if under the age of 18, pregnant or nursing a baby (or an adult for that matter), or if you have any known or suspected medical conditions, and/or taking prescription drugs or over the counter medications. *DISCLAIMER: Always consult with a qualified health physician before taking any new dietary supplement.

Konsument ponosi odpowiedzialność za zmniejszenie wartości rzeczy będącej przedmiotem umowy a będące wynikiem korzystania z niej w sposób wykraczający poza konieczny do stwierdzenia charakteru, cech i funkcjonowania rzeczy. Sprzedający niezwłocznie, nie później niż w terminie 14 dni roboczych od dnia otrzymania oświadczenia o odstąpieniu od umowy złożonego przez Konsumenta zwróci Konsumentowi wszystkie dokonane przez niego płatności, w tym koszty dostarczenia rzeczy, a jeżeli Konsument wybrał sposób dostawy inny niż najtańszy zwykły sposób dostarczenia oferowany przez Sprzedającego , Sprzedający nie zwróci Konsumentowi dodatkowych kosztów zgodnie z art 33 Prawa konsumenckiego . Sprzedający dokonuje zwrotu zapłaty przy użyciu takiego samego sposobu płatności , jakiego użył Konsument , chyba że Konsument wyraźnie zgodził się na inny sposób płatności , który nie wiąże się dla niego z żadnymi kosztami. Sprzedający może wstrzymać się ze zwrotem zapłaty otrzymanej od Konsumenta do chwili otrzymania rzeczy z powrotem lub dostarczenia przez Konsumenta dowodu jej odesłania, w zależności od tego, które zdarzenie nastąpi wcześniej. Konsumentowi zgodnie z art 38 Prawa konsumenckiego nie przysługuje prawo do odstąpienia od umowy: w której cena lub wynagrodzenie zależy od wahań na rynku finansowym, nad którymi Sprzedający nie sprawuje kontroli, i które mogą wystąpić przed upływem terminu do odstąpienia od umowy; w której przedmiotem świadczenia jest rzecz nieprefabrykowana, wyprodukowana według specyfikacji konsumenta lub służąca zaspokojeniu jego zindywidualizowanych potrzeb; w której przedmiotem świadczenia jest rzecz ulegająca szybkiemu zepsuciu lub mająca krótki termin przydatności do użycia; w której przedmiotem świadczenia jest rzecz dostarczana w zapieczętowanym opakowaniu, której po otwarciu opakowania nie można zwrócić ze względu na ochronę zdrowia lub ze względów higienicznych, jeżeli opakowanie zostało otwarte po dostarczeniu; w której przedmiotem świadczenia są rzeczy, które po dostarczeniu, ze względu na swój charakter, zostają nierozłącznie połączone z innymi rzeczami; w której przedmiotem świadczenia są nagrania dźwiękowe lub wizualne albo programy komputerowe dostarczane w zapieczętowanym opakowaniu, jeżeli opakowanie zostało otwarte po dostarczeniu; o dostarczanie treści cyfrowych, które nie są zapisane na nośniku materialnym, jeżeli spełnianie świadczenia rozpoczęło się za wyraźną zgodą Konsumenta przed upływem terminu do odstąpienia od umowy i po poinformowaniu go przez przedsiębiorcę o utracie prawa odstąpienia od umowy; o dostarczanie dzienników, periodyków lub czasopism, z wyjątkiem umowy o prenumeratę. §5 Rękojmia Sprzedający na podstawie art. 558§1 Kodeksu cywilnego całkowicie wyłącza odpowiedzialność wobec Klientów z tytułu wad fizycznych i prawnych (rękojmia). Sprzedający ponosi odpowiedzialność wobec Konsumenta na zasadach określonych w art. 556 Kodeksu cywilnego i kolejnych za wady (rękojmia). W przypadku umowy z Konsumentem jeżeli wada fizyczna została stwierdzona przed upływem roku od momentu wydania rzeczy , przyjmuje się, że istniała ona w chwili przejścia niebezpieczeństwa na Konsumenta . Konsument jeżeli rzecz sprzedana ma wadę , może: złożyć oświadczenie o żądaniu obniżenia ceny; złożyć oświadczenie o odstąpieniu od umowy; chyba że Sprzedający niezwłocznie i bez nadmiernych niedogodności dla Konsumenta wymieni rzecz wadliwą na wolną od wad albo wadę usunie. Jeżeli jednak rzecz była już wymieniona lub naprawiana przez Sprzedającego albo Sprzedający nie uczynił zadość obowiązkowi wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad lub usunięcia wady, nie przysługuje mu prawo do wymiany rzeczy lub usunięcia wady. Konsument , może zamiast zaproponowanego przez Sprzedającego usunięcia wady żądać wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad albo zamiast wymiany rzeczy żądać usunięcia wady, chyba że doprowadzenie rzeczy do zgodności z umową w sposób wybrany przez Konsumenta jest niemożliwe albo wymagałoby nadmiernych kosztów w porównaniu ze sposobem proponowanym przez Sprzedającego , przy czym przy ocenie nadmierności kosztów uwzględnia się wartość rzeczy wolnej od wad, rodzaj i znaczenie stwierdzonej wady, a także bierze się pod uwagę niedogodności, na jakie narażałby Konsumenta inny sposób zaspokojenia. Konsument nie może odstąpić od umowy , jeżeli wada jest nieistotna. Konsument jeżeli rzecz sprzedana ma wadę, może również: żądać wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad; żądać usunięcia wady. Sprzedający jest obowiązany wymienić rzecz wadliwą na wolną od wad lub usunąć wadę w rozsądnym czasie bez nadmiernych niedogodności dla Konsumenta Sprzedający może odmówić zadośćuczynienia żądaniu Konsumenta , jeżeli doprowadzenie do zgodności z umową rzeczy wadliwej w sposób wybrany przez kupującego jest niemożliwe albo w porównaniu z drugim możliwym sposobem doprowadzenia do zgodności z umową wymagałoby nadmiernych kosztów. W przypadku, jeżeli rzecz wadliwa została zamontowana, Konsument może żądać od Sprzedającego demontażu i ponownego zamontowania po dokonaniu wymiany na wolną od wad lub usunięciu wady, jednak zobowiązany jest ponieść część związanych z tym kosztów przewyższających cenę rzeczy sprzedanej albo może żądać od Sprzedającego zapłaty części kosztów demontażu i ponownego zamontowania, do wysokości ceny rzeczy sprzedanej. W razie niewykonania obowiązku przez Sprzedającego , Konsument jest upoważniony do dokonania tych czynności na koszt i niebezpieczeństwo Sprzedającego . Konsument , który wykonuje uprawnienia z tytułu rękojmi, jest obowiązany na koszt Sprzedającego dostarczyć rzecz wadliwą na adres reklamacyjny, a jeżeli ze względu na rodzaj rzeczy lub sposób jej zamontowania dostarczenie rzeczy przez Konsumenta byłoby nadmiernie utrudnione, Konsument obowiązany jest udostępnić rzecz Sprzedającemu w miejscu, w którym rzecz się znajduje. W razie niewykonania obowiązku przez Sprzedającego Konsument jest upoważniony do odesłania rzeczy na koszt i niebezpieczeństwo Sprzedającego . Koszty wymiany lub naprawy ponosi Sprzedający , za wyjątkiem sytuacji opisanej w §5 pkt 10. Sprzedający obowiązany jest przyjąć od Konsumenta rzecz wadliwą w razie wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad lub odstąpienia od umowy. Sprzedający w terminie czternastu dni ustosunkuje się do: oświadczenia o żądaniu obniżenia ceny; oświadczenia o odstąpieniu od umowy; żądania wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad; żądania usunięcia wady. W przeciwnym wypadku uważa się, że uznał za uzasadnione oświadczenie lub żądanie Konsumenta . Sprzedający odpowiada z tytułu rękojmi, jeżeli wada fizyczna zostanie stwierdzona przed upływem dwóch lat od momentu wydania rzeczy Konsumentowi , a jeżeli przedmiotem sprzedaży jest rzecz używana przed upływem roku od momentu wydania rzeczy Konsumentowi . Roszczenie Konsumenta o usunięcie wady lub wymianę rzeczy sprzedanej na wolną od wad przedawnia się z upływem roku, licząc od dnia stwierdzenia wady jednak nie wcześniej niż przed upływem dwóch lat od momentu wydania rzeczy Konsumentowi , a jeżeli przedmiotem sprzedaży jest rzecz używana przed upływem roku od momentu wydania rzeczy Konsumentowi . W przypadku, kiedy określony przez Sprzedającego lub producenta termin przydatności rzeczy do użycia kończy się po upływie dwóch lat od momentu wydania rzeczy Konsumentowi , Sprzedający odpowiada z tytułu rękojmi za wady fizyczne tej rzeczy stwierdzone przed upływem tego terminu. W terminach określonych w §5 pkt 15-17 Konsument może złożyć oświadczenie o odstąpieniu od umowy albo obniżeniu ceny z powodu wady fizycznej rzeczy sprzedanej, a jeżeli Konsument żądał wymiany rzeczy na wolną od wad lub usunięcia wady, bieg terminu do złożenia oświadczenia o odstąpieniu od umowy albo obniżeniu ceny rozpoczyna się z chwilą bezskutecznego upływu terminu do wymiany rzeczy lub usunięcia wady. W razie dochodzenia przed sądem albo sądem polubownym jednego z uprawnień z tytułu rękojmi termin do wykonania innych uprawnień, przysługujących Konsumentowi z tego tytułu, ulega zawieszeniu do czasu prawomocnego zakończenia postępowania. Odpowiednio stosuje się również do postępowania mediacyjnego, przy czym termin do wykonania innych uprawnień z tytułu rękojmi, przysługujących Konsumentowi , zaczyna biec od dnia odmowy przez sąd zatwierdzenia ugody zawartej przed mediatorem lub bezskutecznego zakończenia mediacji. Do wykonywania uprawnień z tytułu rękojmi za wady prawne rzeczy sprzedanej stosuje się §5 pkt 15-16, z tym że bieg terminu rozpoczyna się od dnia, w którym Konsument dowiedział się o istnieniu wady, a jeżeli Konsument dowiedział się o istnieniu wady dopiero na skutek powództwa osoby trzeciej – od dnia, w którym orzeczenie wydane w sporze z osobą trzecią stało się prawomocne. Jeżeli z powodu wady rzeczy Konsument złożył oświadczenie o odstąpieniu od umowy albo obniżeniu ceny, może on żądać naprawienia szkody, którą poniósł przez to, że zawarł umowę, nie wiedząc o istnieniu wady, choćby szkoda była następstwem okoliczności, za które Sprzedający nie ponosi odpowiedzialności, a w szczególności może żądać zwrotu kosztów zawarcia umowy, kosztów odebrania, przewozu, przechowania i ubezpieczenia rzeczy, zwrotu dokonanych nakładów w takim zakresie, w jakim nie odniósł z nich korzyści, a nie otrzymał ich zwrotu od osoby trzeciej oraz zwrotu kosztów procesu. Nie uchybia to przepisom o obowiązku naprawienia szkody na zasadach ogólnych. Upływ żadnego terminu do stwierdzenia wady nie wyłącza wykonania uprawnień z tytułu rękojmi, jeżeli Sprzedający wadę podstępnie zataił. Sprzedający o ile jest zobowiązany do świadczenia lub świadczenia finansowego na rzecz Konsumenta wykona je bez zbędnej zwłoki, nie później niż terminie przewidzianym w prawie. §6 Polityka prywatności oraz bezpieczeństwo danych osobowych Administratorem baz danych osobowych przekazywanych przez Konsumentów sklepu jest Sprzedający .

Research Background on BPC-157 BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound-157) is a synthetic peptide based on a sequence found in human gastric juice. Much of the interest around BPC-157 comes from preclinical and animal studies , where it has been investigated for its potential roles in tissue repair, angiogenesis, and protection of various systems.

By choosing top-shelf supplementation, you invest in certainty. Primal Code stands out from the competition with its uncompromising approach to composition. Many companies cut costs by adding trace amounts of active substances. Here, every capsule or scoop of powder is packed with ingredients of confirmed effectiveness in the bodybuilding environment. The main benefit you receive is breaking through stagnation . Regardless of whether your goal is to reduce stubborn fat, build lean muscle mass, or drastically improve strength – these products act on metabolic and hormonal pathways in a way that forces the body to adapt. You gain tools that allow you to train harder, longer, and more effectively. This is support for your determination. Primal Rage – hardcore pre-workout with DMAA The flagship pre-workout product, Primal Rage, was created so you can perform the workout of your life, even on a bad day. Its action is based on stimulating the central nervous system thanks to the presence of DMAA and yohimbine. What does this mean for you in practice? Laser focus: Mental fatigue disappears, and the so-called \"tunnel vision\" appears. All that matters is you and the barbell. This is a state where every set is performed with maximum precision. Infinite energy: Thanks to strong stimulants, you feel a surge of power that doesn't end after 30 minutes. You are able to maintain high intensity from the warm-up until the last exercise. Muscle pump: The presence of agmatine causes your muscles to fill with blood, which not only looks impressive but also improves the transport of nutrients to muscle cells. By using Primal Rage, you gain the certainty that no workout will go to waste. It is the ideal solution for days when you plan to break strength records or have very intense volume sessions. Dietary supplements for weight loss from the Primal Rage brand Building muscle is one thing, but revealing it from under a layer of fat is a completely different challenge. Primal Code offers solutions that attack fat tissue from many sides, accelerating metabolism and suppressing appetite. Razor Cut – fat burner for hardcore weight loss This powdered burner is a true metabolic powerhouse. Its strength lies in the synergy of ingredients such as DMHA, dendrobium, synephrine, and yohimbine. What real benefits will you feel when using Razor Cut? Thermogenesis: Your body will start generating more heat, which translates into greater calorie expenditure, even at rest. You will feel this as a pleasant warmth spreading through your body during training. Appetite control: One of the most difficult aspects of reduction is fighting hunger. The ingredients contained in Razor Cut effectively suppress the desire to snack, which makes it easier to maintain a caloric deficit. Energy on a deficit: Usually, when we eat less, we have less energy. Thanks to the stimulants in this product, despite the reduction diet, you will have the strength for intense cardio and strength training. Alpha Cutz – alpha yohimbine to fight stubborn fat For people who have a problem with the so-called \"stubborn fat\" (lower abdomen, sides), Primal Code has prepared Alpha Cutz based on alpha-yohimbine. This is a specific antagonistic agent that blocks the receptors responsible for fat accumulation in critical areas. By using this preparation, you will notice a significant improvement in muscle definition. The skin becomes thinner, vascularity (vein visibility) improves, and the physique gains a hard, \"cut\" look. This is the ideal finishing touch to reduction, the \"cherry on top\" for people preparing their shape for summer or competitions. Building muscle mass and strength with Primal Code It is precisely in this category that the brand shows its true grit. Products based on SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators) are an alternative for people who want results similar to doping, but with a lower risk of side effects. Primal Mass – SARM ligandrol for maximum muscle growth Ligandrol (LGD-4033) contained in Primal Mass is the king of volume building. It works strongly anabolically by binding to receptors in muscles and bones. Lean mass growth: We are not talking about \"bloating\" with water here. Primal Mass supports the building of dense, hard muscle. Muscle fullness: Thanks to increased glycogen retention, muscles are full and pumped up all the time, which gives the visual effect of being bigger around the clock, not just during training. Structure strengthening: This product also positively affects bone mineralization, which is crucial when lifting heavy weights. Primal Strength Ostarine – SARM for strength and good quality muscles Ostarine (MK-2866) is the most researched and versatile agent in the offer. Primal Strength is the ideal choice for a first cycle or as support during a detraining period. Its unique feature is the amazing effect on joint and tendon regeneration . If you are struggling with minor injuries, ostarine can significantly speed up their healing process. Additionally, it allows for constant, stable strength progress and improvement of body composition (recomposition) - which means simultaneous muscle building and fat burning. Primal Test – training aggression and power of SARM RAD-140 If you are looking for something that will drastically increase your strength and dynamics, Primal Test with RAD-140 (Testolone) is the answer. It is one of the strongest SARMs on the market. Strength explosion: Users often report breaking personal records from week to week. Physique hardness: RAD-140 gives the physique a characteristic, \"veiny\" and dry appearance. Motivation: The androgenic effect translates into greater self-confidence and a desire for competition during training. Primal Growth Growth Hormone Booster – ibutamoren Ibutamoren (MK-677) is a ghrelin mimetic that stimulates the secretion of natural growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1. Primal Growth is the key to cellular-level regeneration. The main advantage is improved sleep quality . You sleep deeper, and the REM phase is longer, so you wake up fully rested. A higher level of HGH also has a beneficial effect on the condition of skin, hair, and nails, and accelerates the healing of all muscle micro-injuries. This is the foundation for building large muscle mass, as it allows you to train more often without the risk of overtraining. Primal Endure – excellent muscle endurance support thanks to cardarine Cardarine (GW-501516) is an absolute hit among people training endurance sports, as well as bodybuilders doing cardio. Primal Endure changes the way your body manages energy. Switching to fat burning: The body more readily uses fat tissue as an energy source, saving muscle glycogen. No breathlessness: Aerobic capacity increases drastically. You can run faster, do more repetitions, and rest less between sets. Lipid profile: Interestingly, Cardarine can positively affect the level of \"good\" cholesterol, supporting cardiovascular health. Primal Code Godzilla – SARM STACK for advanced users For those who accept no compromises, Godzilla was created. It is a stack (combination) of four powerful ingredients: Ostarine, Ibutamoren, Testolone, and Ligandrol. This is a complete product. It provides mass, strength, regeneration, and endurance simultaneously. However, it is a solution for people with extensive experience who know how to manage such strong stimulation of the body. The visual effects with an appropriate diet are spectacular and visible in a very short time. Return to hormonal balance after the cycle – Primal Reboot The use of advanced agents requires a smart \"come down\" from the cycle to maintain the achieved results and restore natural hormonal balance. Primal Reboot is a PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) product based on Arimistane. Its task is to: Lower cortisol: The stress hormone destroys muscles. Primal Reboot keeps it in check. Estrogen control: Arimistane is an effective aromatase inhibitor, which prevents water retention and fat storage after the cycle. Testosterone booster: It helps to restore the natural production of the male hormone faster, which is crucial for maintaining strength and muscle mass, as well as well-being. Primal Code is your reliable partner for better shape By choosing the Primal Code brand, you opt for uncompromising quality and action. It is an investment in accelerating the achievement of your physique goals. Remember that these supplements are a tool in your hands – used wisely, they will bring spectacular results.

Struktura Chemiczna i Właściwości Paracetamol jest prostą, aromatyczną cząsteczką, składającą się z pierścienia benzenowego podstawionego grupą hydroksylową (-OH) w pozycji para oraz grupą acetamidową (-NHCOCH₃) również w pozycji para . Ta struktura decyduje o jego właściwościach fizykochemicznych i aktywności biologicznej. Jako odczynnik, jest związkiem stabilnym, ale wrażliwym na hydrolizę w silnie kwaśnych lub zasadowych warunkach, która może prowadzić do powstania *p*-aminofenolu i kwasu octowego.

Jest naturalnie syntetyzowana w organizmach zwierząt, a także dostępna jako suplement diety i odczynnik laboratoryjny o wysokiej czystości. 🔬 Szczegółowe Dane Fizykochemiczne KREATYNA – 100g Właściwość Wartość/Specyfikacja Źródło Nazwa systematyczna IUPAC kwas 2-[karbamimidylo(metylo)amino]octowy Nazwa zwyczajowa Kreatyna Wzór sumaryczny C₄H₉N₃O₂ Masa molowa 131,13 g/mol Numer CAS 57-00-1 Wygląd Biały, krystaliczny proszek, bezwonny Gęstość 1,33 g/cm³ Temperatura topnienia 255–260 °C (z rozkładem) Temperatura wrzenia N/D (związek ulega rozkładowi przed wrzeniem) – Temperatura zapłonu 118,1 °C (244,6 °F; 391,2 K) Rozpuszczalność w wodzie 13,3 g/L (w 18 °C) LogP (wsp. podziału oktanol/woda) -1,258 (hydrofilowy) pKa 3,429 (grupa karboksylowa) pKb 10,568 Punkt izoelektryczny 8,47 Ciśnienie pary 0,001 mmHg Struktura molekularna w ASCII: text O\r\n    ║\r\n   HO−C−CH₂−N−C(NH₂)₂\r\n          │\r\n          CH₃ Uproszczony zapis grupy guanidynowej: −N−C(NH₂)₂. W roztworze wodnym kreatyna istnieje w formie obojnaczej (zwitterjonowej), gdzie grupa karboksylowa jest zdeprotonowana (-COO⁻), a grupa guanidynowa jest protonowana (=NH₂⁺). Stabilność i przechowywanie: Stabilna w postaci suchej w temperaturze pokojowej. W roztworach wodnych powoli ulega nieodwracalnej cyklizacji do kreatyniny (2-amino-1-metylo-1H-imidazol-4(5H)-on), szczególnie w podwyższonej temperaturze i w środowisku kwaśnym. Warunki przechowywania: Szczelnie zamknięte pojemniki, w suchym, chłodnym miejscu (temp. 2-8°C), z ochroną przed wilgocią i światłem. 📊 Metabolizm i Rola Biologiczna Kreatyna jest syntetyzowana w organizmie człowieka głównie w wątrobie, nerkach i trzustce z aminokwasów: glicyny, argininy i metioniny (dostarczającej grupę metylową). Szacuje się, że około połowa dziennego zapotrzebowania jest endogennie produkowana, a druga połowa musi być dostarczona z dietą (głównie z mięsa i ryb). Funkcja energetyczna: Ok. 95% całkowitych zasobów kreatyny w organizmie znajduje się w mięśniach szkieletowych. Jest ona fosforylowana przez enzym kinazę kreatynową (CK) do fosfokreatyny (PCr) , która stanowi bogatoenergetyczną rezerwę fosfaranową. System fosfagenowy: Fosfokreatyna pełni kluczową rolę w szybkiej resyntezie ATP (adenozynotrifosforanu) z ADP (adenozynodifosforanu) podczas krótkotrwałego, intensywnego wysiłku fizycznego (np. podnoszenie ciężarów, sprint). text ADP + fosfokreatyna ⇌ ATP + kreatyna Reakcja ta jest szybka i odwracalna, stanowiąc bufor energetyczny dla komórek o wysokim i gwałtownym zapotrzebowaniu na energię. Transport energii (obieg kreatynowy): System fosfokreatyny działa również jako intrakomórkowy system transportu energii (tzw. obieg kreatynowy lub phosphocreatine circuit ), przenosząc wysokoenergetyczne fosforany z mitochondriów (miejsc produkcji ATP) do cytoplazmy i miofibryli, gdzie energia jest zużywana, np. do skurczu mięśnia. Czynniki wpływające na stężenie: Masa mięśniowa: Osoby o większej masie mięśniowej mają wyższe stężenie kreatyniny (produktu degradacji kreatyny) we krwi. Dieta: Weganie i wegetarianie mają zwykle niższe początkowe stężenie kreatyny w mięśniach. Wiek i płeć: Stężenia mogą się różnić w zależności od wieku i płci. Aktywność fizyczna: Intensywny wysiłek może tymczasowo zwiększyć stężenie kreatyniny we krwi. 🧪 Zastosowania Badawcze i Potencjał Terapeutyczny Kreatyna jest intensywnie badana nie tylko w kontekście wydolności fizycznej, ale także w różnych obszarach medycyny i fizjologii. Badania Wydolności Fizycznej i Adaptacji Treningowej: Suplementacja kreatyną jest jednym z najskuteczniejszych ergogenicznych środków żywieniowych dla zwiększenia siły, mocy i przyrostu beztłuszczowej masy ciała podczas treningu oporowego. Mechanizmy obejmują: zwiększoną dostępność fosfokreatyny dla resyntezy ATP, działanie antykataboliczne, stymulację sygnałów anabolicznych (np. mTOR), zwiększoną hydratację komórek mięśniowych oraz potencjalne działanie antyoksydacyjne. Neurologia i Neuroprotekcja: Mózg jest drugim po mięśniach organem o wysokim zapotrzebowaniu energetycznym i również wykorzystuje system fosfokreatyny. Badany jest potencjał kreatyny w łagodzeniu objawów i spowalnianiu progresji w chorobach neurodegeneracyjnych ( m.in . choroba Huntingtona, Parkinsona, stwardnienie zanikowe boczne – ALS), udarze mózgu oraz urazach mózgu . Kreatyna może poprawiać funkcje poznawcze , szczególnie w warunkach niedoboru snu lub stresu metabolicznego. Medycyna Metaboliczna i Kardiologia: Prowadzone są badania nad zastosowaniem kreatyny w niewydolności serca (poprawa metabolizmu energetycznego kardiomiocytów), cukrzycy (wrażliwość insulinowa) oraz w stanach prowadzących do zaniku mięśni (sarkopenia, kacheksja nowotworowa). Wrodzone Błędy Metabolizmu: Istnieją trzy główne zaburzenia metabolizmu kreatyny: niedobór kinazy kreatynowej , niedobór transportera kreatyny (SLC6A8) oraz niedobór enzymów biosyntezy (GAMT i GATM) . Prowadzą one do ciężkich objawów neurologicznych, a suplementacja kreatyną (tam gdzie jest możliwa) jest podstawą leczenia. ⚠️ Bezpieczeństwo, Toksykologia i Środki Ostrożności Klasyfikacja Zagrożeń (GHS): Xi (Działanie Drażniące) . Zwroty Ryzyka (R): R36/37/38 – Drażniący dla oczu, dróg oddechowych i skóry. Zwroty Bezpieczeństwa (S): S26-S36 – W przypadku kontaktu z oczami należy je natychmiast przepłukać obficie wodą i zasięgnąć porady lekarza. Nosić odpowiednią odzież ochronną. Dane o Toksyczności: LD50 (dermalnie, szczur): > 2000 mg/kg. Kreatyna jest generalnie uznawana za bezpieczną przy krótkotrwałym stosowaniu doustnym w zalecanych dawkach u zdrowych osób. Doniesienia o skutkach ubocznych (skurcze, problemy żołądkowo-jelitowe, uszkodzenie nerek) są nieliczne, często powiązane z nieodpowiednim nawodnieniem lub przyjmowaniem ekstremalnie wysokich dawek przez długi czas. Adekwatne nawodnienie jest kluczowe podczas suplementacji. Środki Ostrożności podczas Pracy w Laboratorium: Stosować rękawice ochronne , ochronę oczu (gogle) i odzież ochronną . Unikać tworzenia się pyłu i wdychania go. Stosować w wentylowanym miejscu lub z ochroną dróg oddechowych. W przypadku kontaktu ze skórą lub oczami: przemyć obficie wodą. W przypadku połknięcia lub wystąpienia niepokojących objawów po inhalacji: zasięgnąć porady lekarskiej. 📚 Bibliografia Naukowa (Podstawowe Źródła) Morozov, I. S., et al.

The irreversible MAOI, Parnate , takes 48 hours to restore ~50%. Whereas the reversible MAOI, Moclobemide , has a 1 – 2 hr half-life and completely reverses within 24 hr [ x , x ] Discussing Clorgyline targets other than MAO-A/B Clorgyline is possibly a very high affinity sigma-1 agonist (Ki = 3.2 nM), since its CA3 NMDA potentiation is prevented by the sigma-1 antagonists, Haloperidol and BMY-14802 . But Clorgyline becomes a sigma-1 antagonist at higher intravenous mcg/kg doses in rats similarly to Sertraline , which is difficult to accurately convert to a human equivalent dose because they weren’t orally administered in the study [ x , x ] Clorgyline binds to Imidazoline I2 with extremely high affinity (Ki = 0.04 nM = 40 pM), as it’s in the pM range, but with an unknown action.

Thus, DM-506 likely has higher neuronal permeability than Ibogainalog and Tabernanthalog by not having the added bulk of a Methoxy (MeO) or Hydroxy (HO) group. This is seen with DMT being more neuronally permeable than 5-MeO-DMT and Psilocin (4-HO-DMT), allowing greater intracellular 5-HT2A interaction [ x ] DM-506 is a very strong inhibitor of 5-HT7’s response (-52.3%) compared to Ibogainalog (-35.9%) and Tabernanthalog (-14.3%), about as strong as SB-269970 which is one of the most potent 5-HT7 antagonist/inverse agonists known [ x ] Interestingly, DM-506 has a higher 5-HT2A affinity (Ki = 19 nM) than DMT (Ki = 127.0 nM) and Psilocin (Ki = 107.2 nM) [ x , x ] Why DM-506 over the isoDMT derivative RC candidates In summary, both the parent compound, isoDMT , and its derivatives have far too weak 5-HT2A affinity to be chosen over the non-hallucinogenic Ibogaine derivatives Though the isoDMT derivatives are interesting non-hallucinogenic psychedelics, with Zalsupindole being the only active one without a MAOI, isoDMT has a low 5-HT2A affinity (Ki = 600 nM) [ x ] There’s no available data on Zalsupindole ‘s 5-HT2A affinity, it’s hard to believe it’s much better considering that 6-MeO-isoDMT , which is structurally the closest to Zalsupindole , has an even lower 5-HT2A affinity (Ki = 1 040 nM) [ x , x ] Therefore, Zalsupindole (AAZ-A-154) is a close analogue of 6-MeO-isoDMT which has low affinity, making it far less potent than DM-506 Category: Singles Tag: Non-hallucinogenic psychedelic Related products BCP CB2 agonist $ 14.99 image/svg+xml Add to cart AP-DMT N-Acetyl DMT $ 19.97 image/svg+xml Add to cart Clorgyline Irreversible MAOI $ 19.99 image/svg+xml Add to cart Usmarapride 5-HT4 agonist $ 19.99 image/svg+xml Add to cart Products search Login / Register Shopping cart 0 image/svg+xml No products in the cart.

Refrigeration delays precipitation, keeping it stable for roughly an hour and maintaining a homogenous suspension that allows for sufficiently accurate dosing. Shaking the suspension well before use helps ensure even distribution of the material. Concentration: 10 mg/mL Volume: 50 mL Purity: 95.6% (remaining 4.4% is confirmed water) Why Usmarapride (5-HT4 Agonist) Usmarapride is the strongest overall 5-HT4 agonist candidate based on CNS penetration, potency, and pharmacokinetics. CNS Permeability: Usmarapride: Cb/Cp = 3.8 Prucalopride: 0.5 PF-04995274: 0.7 PRX-03140: 1.6 Usmarapride shows far higher brain:plasma concentration ratio than earlier compounds. Bioavailability (F%): Usmarapride: 34% PF-0499527: 5.4% PRX-03140: 2% It avoids the extremely low F% seen in previous molecules. Potency: More potent than RS-67333 in sAPPα secretion assays. Higher 5-HT4 receptor occupancy at lower oral doses. Half-Life: 13.2–18.8 hours in humans. Suven Life Sciences Background: Suven has led long-term CNS-targeted 5-HT4 agonist development, optimizing affinity, Emax, permeability (Cb/Cp), and overall PK. Suven CNS Permeability Progression: 2012: Compound 2D / PF-04995274 — Cb/Cp 0.7 2015: Compound 5A — 0.31 2018: Compound 4O — 0.8 2021: Compound 12L / Usmarapride — 3.8 Additional information Weight 0.06 kg Country of Origin Netherlands hs_code 2934990000 Related products Out of stock Add to Wishlist Remove from Wishlist Add to Wishlist Lithium Ascorbate € 0.00 Read more Out of stock Add to Wishlist Remove from Wishlist Add to Wishlist Paraxanthine (1,7-Dimethylxanthine) € 21.00 Read more Add to Wishlist Remove from Wishlist Add to Wishlist KW-6356 € 18.00 Buy now My Account Wishlist [email protected] Usmarapride Fluid € 20.00 Original price was: €20.00. € 15.00 Current price is: €15.00.

Purity 88.5%+ (no other organic compounds found in sample, rest % is water) 0.5g powder, 50ml liquid Why Clorgyline as a irreversible selective MAO-A inhibitor In summary, the most potent irreversible MAO-A inhibitors in order is: Clorgyline > Nardil (Phenelzine) > Parnate (Tranylcypromine) > Marplan (Isocarboxazid) Comparing the MAO-A inhibition potency; Clorgyline (IC50 = 4.2 nM) > Nardil (IC50 = 15 nM) > Parnate (IC50 = 237 nM) > Marplan (IC50 = 4 800 nM) [ x , x ] Selegiline (IC50 = 970 nM), Pargyline (IC50 = >2 000 nM), and Rasagiline are selective for MAO-B and are weak MAO-A inhibitors [ x ] Clorgyline is the only non MAO-B inhibitor out of the irreversible MAOIs, so Clorgyline lacks downsides associated with unselective MAO-A/B inhibition such as excessive monoamine buildup, leading to undesirable effects, seen with Parnate [ x ] Clorgyline lasts all day because it irreversibly inhibits MAO-A, meaning that the MAO-A enzymes are permanently inhibited and must be restored with newly created MAO-A enzymes. The irreversible MAOI, Parnate , takes 48 hours to restore ~50%. Whereas the reversible MAOI, Moclobemide , has a 1 – 2 hr half-life and completely reverses within 24 hr [ x , x ] Discussing Clorgyline targets other than MAO-A/B Clorgyline is possibly a very high affinity sigma-1 agonist (Ki = 3.2 nM), since its CA3 NMDA potentiation is prevented by the sigma-1 antagonists, Haloperidol and BMY-14802 . But Clorgyline becomes a sigma-1 antagonist at higher intravenous mcg/kg doses in rats similarly to Sertraline , which is difficult to accurately convert to a human equivalent dose because they weren’t orally administered in the study [ x , x ] Clorgyline binds to Imidazoline I2 with extremely high affinity (Ki = 0.04 nM = 40 pM), as it’s in the pM range, but with an unknown action. This receptor currently has low research on it [ x , x ] The information and chemical has been provided by Limitlesschems.com. We ask all questions about the chemical be directed to them.

Description Bromantane (adamantylbromophenylamine) is a synthetic adamantane derivative originally developed in Russia. It has been observed to enhance both physical and mental performance under stress . Mechanistically, Bromantane is believed to increase dopaminergic activity by elevating dopamine synthesis and release while upregulating tyrosine hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase expression. It may also modulate serotonergic systems indirectly, contributing to improved mood and motivation.

Purity 88.5%+ (no other organic compounds found in sample, rest % is water) 2g powder Why Clorgyline as a irreversible selective MAO-A inhibitor In summary, the most potent irreversible MAO-A inhibitors in order is: Clorgyline > Nardil (Phenelzine) > Parnate (Tranylcypromine) > Marplan (Isocarboxazid) Comparing the MAO-A inhibition potency; Clorgyline (IC50 = 4.2 nM) > Nardil (IC50 = 15 nM) > Parnate (IC50 = 237 nM) > Marplan (IC50 = 4 800 nM) [ x , x ] Selegiline (IC50 = 970 nM), Pargyline (IC50 = >2 000 nM), and Rasagiline are selective for MAO-B and are weak MAO-A inhibitors [ x ] Clorgyline is the only non MAO-B inhibitor out of the irreversible MAOIs, so Clorgyline lacks downsides associated with unselective MAO-A/B inhibition such as excessive monoamine buildup, leading to undesirable effects, seen with Parnate [ x ] Clorgyline lasts all day because it irreversibly inhibits MAO-A, meaning that the MAO-A enzymes are permanently inhibited and must be restored with newly created MAO-A enzymes. The irreversible MAOI, Parnate , takes 48 hours to restore ~50%. Whereas the reversible MAOI, Moclobemide , has a 1 – 2 hr half-life and completely reverses within 24 hr [ x , x ] Discussing Clorgyline targets other than MAO-A/B Clorgyline is possibly a very high affinity sigma-1 agonist (Ki = 3.2 nM), since its CA3 NMDA potentiation is prevented by the sigma-1 antagonists, Haloperidol and BMY-14802 . But Clorgyline becomes a sigma-1 antagonist at higher intravenous mcg/kg doses in rats similarly to Sertraline , which is difficult to accurately convert to a human equivalent dose because they weren’t orally administered in the study [ x , x ] Clorgyline binds to Imidazoline I2 with extremely high affinity (Ki = 0.04 nM = 40 pM), as it’s in the pM range, but with an unknown action. This receptor currently has low research on it [ x , x ] The information and chemical has been provided by Limitlesschems.com. We ask all questions about the chemical be directed to them.

Description Urolithin B is another gut microbial metabolite of ellagitannins, structurally similar to Urolithin A but with one fewer hydroxyl group (Urolithin B is 3-hydroxy-dibenzo-α-pyranone). It has drawn interest for its effects on skeletal muscle and metabolism. In vivo studies have identified Urolithin B as a positive regulator of muscle mass: it was shown to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy in mice and to mitigate muscle atrophy after neuroinjury . Urolithin B appears to act, at least in part, by enhancing protein synthesis pathways in muscle cells (e.g., activating mTOR signaling) and by downregulating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway responsible for muscle protein breakdown . Interestingly, Urolithin B also has been noted to have an androgenic-like effect on muscle without affecting other androgen-sensitive organs, implying a degree of tissue selectivity . Beyond muscle, Urolithin B exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. It can inhibit NF-κB activation and reduce pro-inflammatory mediator production in macrophages, which contributes to an overall protective effect in metabolic tissues . While Urolithin B is less studied than Urolithin A in human contexts, these findings suggest it could be useful in preventing muscle wasting (sarcopenia) or as a sports nutrition supplement. Further clinical research is needed to establish safety, bioavailability, and efficacy in humans.

Description Urolithin A is a microbiome-derived metabolite produced in the gut by the transformation of ellagitannins and ellagic acid (found in pomegranate, berries, etc.) . Chemically, it is a dibenzo-α-pyrone structure with two hydroxyl groups. Urolithin A has garnered attention for its ability to induce mitophagy , the selective recycling of damaged mitochondria, which is a key mechanism in cellular aging. Preclinical studies demonstrated that Urolithin A supplementation improved mitochondrial function and muscle health: in aged rodents, it increased endurance and exercise capacity by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and upregulating genes involved in autophagy and muscle function . Urolithin A also shows anti-inflammatory effects and neuroprotective potential . For instance, it can cross the blood-brain barrier and has reduced neuroinflammation and improved memory in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, partly by clearing dysfunctional mitochondria . In human trials, Urolithin A (commercially formulated as a supplement) was found to be safe and improved muscle strength and exercise performance in middle-aged adults over a 4-month period . By boosting NAD^+ levels and mitochondrial biogenesis, Urolithin A emerges as a promising anti-aging compound . Ongoing research is examining its benefits for muscle disorders, metabolic health, and longevity.

Это давно известное растение, с мощным целебным и ноотропным эффектом. Исторически использовалось как эффективное средство против тревоги. Список положительных эффектов: •Способствует увеличению силы и росту мышечной массы. Увеличивает уровень тестостерона. Исследование. •Улучшение сна и противотревожный эффект. Предположительно, за счёт действия на ГАМК-рецепторы. У людей с хроническим напряжением снижение тревоги было на 44%. Но эффективность невысокая, если использовать только одну ашвагандха. Не забывайте о психотерапевтах и терапевтических техниках! Исследование. •Антидепрессивный эффект. За счёт влияния на серотонин, адреналин и норадреналин. Исследование. •Улучшение памяти и когнитивных функций. Усиливает нейрогенез и длину аксонов нейронов. Исследование. •Нейропротектор. Ашвагандха противостоит глутамат-индуцированной нейротоксичности. Исследование. Как работает: Механизмов действия ашваганды очень много. Рекомендуем изучить «Пабмед» по запросу «Withania Somnifera» или «Ashwagandha» , чтобы ознакомиться подробнее.

Предупреждение: не является лекарственным средством или БАД. Отказ от ответственности: читайте нашу оферту . Справка: Справка составлена на основе исследований.

Как показало исследование 2012 года, проведенное на грызунах, данное средство стимулирует рост нейронов и повышает уровень дофамина в мозге. Исследование показало, что препарат начинает действовать примерно через 10 дней применения. Было обнаружено, что после этого времени, у крыс улучшилась пространственная память. Допамин является одним из нейротрансмиттеров, которые связаны с повышенной активностью, улучшением настроения, лучшей памятью и бодрствованием. Замедляя или предотвращая поглощение дофамина, препарат способствует активности и концентрации внимания. 9-Me-BC действует как ингибитор обратного захвата дофамина. Однако стоит отметить, что еще предстоит провести обширные исследования на людях, а краткосрочная и долгосрочная безопасность и эффективность препарата еще не установлены. 9-Me-BC обладает широким спектром эффектов, некоторые из них включают: 9-Me-BC ингибирует моноаминоксидазу B (MAO-B), таким образом предотвращая образование нейротоксичных соединений, таких как DOPAC, 6-OH-DA (оксидопамин) и MPDP⁺/MPP⁺, в результате метаболизма дофамина. Эти вещества вызывают гибель дофаминергических нейронов. 9-Me-BC усиливает дыхательную цепь митохондрий. Это достигается за счет увеличения или защиты НАДН-дегидрогеназы, которая используется в процессе переноса электрона для выработки энергии. 9-Me-BC может также увеличивать нейротрофические факторы, такие как фактор роста нервов (NGF), SHH (Sonic Hedgehog), нейротрофический фактор мозга (BDNF), который улучшает когнитивные функции, внимание, а также мотивацию. Он стимулирует активность нейронов, а также способствует росту новых нейронов. Это улучшает память, обучение и общую когнитивную функцию. Противовоспалительные свойства. 9-me-BC борется с хроническим воспалением в головном мозге, уменьшая воспалительные цитокины, которые, как известно, вызывают накопление микроглии, что, в свою очередь, нарушает когнитивные функции. Защита нейронов, дендритов и синапсос в головном мозге Повышает уровень дофамина в головном мозге, предотвращая распад дофамина, в отличие от других стимуляторов, таких как кофеин, которые истощают дофамин за счет чрезмерного высвобождения Защищает от токсичности липополисахаридов и снижает уровень ЛДГ (лактатдегидрогеназы) уменьшает α-синуклеин, агрегация которого образует нерастворимые фибриллы (например, тельца Леви), одну из причин некоторых нейродегенеративных расстройств, таких как БП и БА Побочные эффекты Светочувствительность (повреждение ДНК после воздействия ультрафиолетовых лучей), рекомендуется избегать чрезмерного пребывания на солнце при воздействии 9-Me-BC .

Кломифен (кломид) — стимулятор продукции гонадотропинов. Средство с антиэстрогенной и эстрогенной активностью. Имеет нестероидную структуру, которая близка к хлоротрианизену. Полагают, что действие кломифена обусловлено специфическим связыванием с эстрогенными рецепторами гипоталамуса и гипофиза, что повышает секрецию гонадотропных гормонов гипофиза. Это в свою очередь стимулирует созревание и эндокринную активность фолликула в яичнике, а также последующее образование и стимулирование функции желтого тела.  В малых дозах усиливает секрецию гонадотропинов: пролактина, ФСГ и ЛГ. Стимулирует овуляцию. При малом содержании в организме эстрогенных гормонов проявляет умеренный эстрогенный эффект. При высоком содержании эстрогенов оказывает антиэстрогенное действие. В больших дозах тормозит секрецию гонадотропинов. Гестагенной и андрогенной активностью не обладает. Кломид приобрел большую популярность в 1970-х в медицине как препарат для лечения бесплодия у женщин и сегодня это всё-ещё одно из основных его применений. В бодибилдинге Кломифен используется спортсменами на курсе анаболических стероидов для устранения побочных эффектов, связанных с частичным преобразованием стероидов в эстроген (женский половой гормон), а также для стимулирования внутреннего производства тестостерона после курса стероидов (на ПКТ), которое подавляется при приеме стероидов. Кломифен , попадая внутрь, блокирует рецепторы, с которыми связаны эстрогены и позволяет избежать возникновения нежелательных эффектов, спровоцированных высоким уровнем женских половых гормонов. Препарат уменьшает вероятность гинекомастии, но не предупреждает задержку жидкости в организме. Во время приема стероидов в организме перестает вырабатываться собственный тестостерон, чтобы он начал продуцироваться вновь может понадобиться до 12 месяцев. Чтобы ускорить этот процесс принимают Кломид. Попадая в организм, препарат стимулирует выработку гонадотропина, который активирует биосинтез тестостерона. Если же не принимать препарат, то из-за низкого уровня тестостерона в организме повышается содержание гидрокортизона, что ведет к быстрому набору жировой ткани и разрушению мышечной. Побочные действия Кломид считается одним из самых хорошо переносимых анти-эстрогеннов в спортивной фармакологии и не приводит к серьезным побочным эффектам ни у мужчин, ни у женщин. Однако, кломид, по отзывам, может вызывать расстройства нервной системы, проявляющиеся чаще всего в виде головокружения, головной боли, сонливости, замедления скорости двигательных и психических реакций, депрессии, повышенной возбудимости и бессонницы. Женщины, которые принимают кломифен цитрат для лечения бесплодия отмечают по-крайней мере наличие одного из следующих побочных эффектов: раздражительность, резкие скачки настроения, депрессия, задержка воды в организме. Также на фоне приема Кломида могут возникать нарушения со стороны других систем организма: Метеоризм, тошнота, гастралгия, рвота, диарея (пищеварительная система); Аллергический дерматит, сыпь, вазомоторные расстройства (аллергические реакции); Увеличение размеров яичника, учащение мочеиспускания, полиурия, дисменорея, боли в низу живота, меноррагия (мочеполовая система); «Приливы» крови к лицу, увеличение массы тела, болезненность в области грудных желез, алопеция, снижение остроты зрения (прочие). При использовании кломида возможно нарушение зрения в виде помутнения и размытости. Есть вероятность, что прием кломифена может приводить к снижению плотности костной ткани . Научные исследования не подтверждают взаимосвязи между употреблением кломифена цитрата и риском возникновения рака (груди, матки и других форм), в том числе и при длительном его приеме. Необходимо понимать, что практически все доступные исследования проводились на женщинах, принимающих кломифен для лечения бесплодия.

Our mission is to drive innovation through a commitment to client goals, scientific rigor, sustainable operations and public advocacy. LEARN MORE What our clients are saying I've never seen such high-quality customer service in my life. I'm truly blown away by the amount of detail and care put into every question asked, whether it be about quality control, third-party testing, or a piece of obscure research in which Science.bio is well-versed. I know I'm in better than good hands when ordering from Science. Taylor E. Purchase Manager Science.bio sets the standard for customer service. I have purchased reference materials for years. I continue to be impressed with this company. What sets this company apart from the rest is the care and attention they give you at each and every interaction. They care about you. Time and time again their team has bent over backwards to ensure everything is perfect and that I'm happy. They are truly the best. Todd M. Postdoc Researcher I'm extremely impressed by the presentation and quality of Science.bio's products. It's clear how much time and attention to detail was put into the products, the website, the public lab reports and the easy checkout. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Laura P. Safety Officer Not only am I increasingly impressed with the amount of knowledge the Science team has about the latest published research, their products, best practices, and so on, but paired with their willingness to freely share this with others so that customers are well-informed shows me how passionate they are. I've never seen a company with so much integrity. Austin O. Principal Investigator It's important for my work that I can rely on consistent, quality products. I trust Science to always deliver in terms of customer support, delivery time, and quality. I have never been let down. Simon J. Compliance Officer I have used Science.bio four times. They consistently deliver quality products and outstanding service. The level of excellence they display is remarkably consistent and, despite being a repeat customer, still surprises me. They have no peer in their industry and I am a customer for life. Fredrick B. Analytical Chemist Science has the most consistent reference standards on the market. They have excellent customer service, answer all my questions with great attention to detail. Science has truly earned my trust. I can't imagine myself going anywhere else. Raul S.

Cerebrolysin® improves the brain's ability to recover by stimulating the regeneration of the nervous system. Legal Notice: Cerebrolysin® is a registered trademark of EVER Pharma. All trademarks and brand names are the property of their respective owners. This website/store is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ЕVER Pharma. Active substance: Cerebrolysin® concentrate (pig brain-derived peptide complex) Pharmachologic effect: nootropic, neurometabolic Pharmacodynamics: Cerebrolysin® contains low-molecular-weight biologically active neuropeptides that penetrate the BBB and directly enter the nerve cells. The drug has an organ-specific multimodal effect on the brain, i.e. provides metabolic regulation, neuroprotection, functional neuromodulation and neurotrophic activity. Metabolic regulation: Cerebrolysin® increases the efficiency of aerobic energy metabolism in the brain, improves intracellular protein synthesis in the developing and aging brain. Neuroprotection: Cerebrolysin® protects neurons from the damaging effect of lactic acidosis, prevents the formation of free radicals, increases survival and prevents neuronal death under conditions of hypoxia and ischemia, and reduces the damaging neurotoxic effect of excitatory amino acids (glutamate). Neurotrophic activity: Cerebrolysin® is the only peptidergic nootropic drug with proven neurotrophic activity, similar to the action of natural neuronal growth factors (NGF), but manifested under conditions of peripheral administration. Functional neuromodulation: Cerebrolysin® has a positive effect on cognitive impairment, improves memory processes. Pharmacokinetics: The complex composition of Cerebrolysin®, the active fraction of which consists of a balanced and stable mixture of biologically active oligopeptides with a total polyfunctional effect, does not allow for the usual pharmacokinetic analysis of individual components. Indications: Alzheimer's disease; dementia of various origins; chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency; ischemic stroke; traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries; mental retardation in children; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); with endogenous depression resistant to antidepressants - in combination therapy. Contraindications: individual intolerance to the drug; severe renal failure; status epilepticus. Use with caution: allergic diathesis; diseases of an epileptic nature, incl. with generalized epilepsy (due to a possible increase in the frequency of seizures). Pregnancy and breast-feeding: During pregnancy and during breastfeeding, Cerebrolysin® should be used only after a careful analysis of the ratio of the positive effect of treatment and the risk associated with its implementation. The results of experimental studies do not give grounds to believe that  Cerebrolysin® has a teratogenic effect or has a toxic effect on the fetus. However, similar clinical studies have not been conducted. Side effects: RARELY (from 0.01% to 0.1% cases): loss of appetite; the alleged activation effect is accompanied by arousal, manifested by aggressive behavior, confusion, insomnia; too fast administration of the drug may lead to dizziness; VERY RARELY (less than 0.01% cases): increased individual sensitivity, allergic reactions, skin reactions, pain in the neck, head and extremities, fever, mild back pain, shortness of breath, chills, collaptoid state; isolated cases of generalized epilepsy; too fast administration of the drug can lead to increased heart rate and arrhythmias; slidispepsia, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting. Since Cerebrolysin® is used mainly in elderly patients, the above symptoms of the diseases are typical for this age group and often also occur without the use of the drug. It should be noted that some undesirable effects (agitation, arterial hypertension, arterial hypotension, lethargy, tremor, depression, apathy, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea) were identified in clinical trials and occurred to the same extent as in patients, who received Cerebrolysin®, and in patients in the placebo group. Interaction: Taking into account the pharmacological profile of  Cerebrolysin®, special attention should be paid to possible additive effects when administered simultaneously with antidepressants, incl. MAO inhibitors. In such cases, it is recommended to reduce the dose of the antidepressant. The use of high doses of Cerebrolysin® (30-40 ml) in combination with high doses of MAO inhibitors can cause an increase in blood pressure. Do not mix Cerebrolysin® and balanced amino acid solutions in the same solution for infusion. Cerebrolysin® is incompatible with solutions that contain lipids and solutions that change the pH  (5–8). Dosing and Administration: Intramuscularly (up to 5 ml), intravenously (up to 10 ml), intravenously by slow infusion (10 to 50 ml). Doses and duration of treatment depend on the nature and severity of the disease, as well as on the patient's age. Perhaps the appointment of single doses, the value of which can reach 50 ml, but it is more preferable to carry out a course of treatment. The recommended optimal course of treatment is daily injections for 10–20 days. Acute conditions (ischemic stroke, TBI, complications after neurosurgical operations) - from 10 to 50 ml. The residual period of cerebral stroke and traumatic injury to the brain and spinal cord is from 5 to 50 ml. Psychoorganic syndrome and depression - from 5 to 30 ml. Alzheimer's disease, dementia of vascular and combined Alzheimer's-vascular genesis - from 5 to 30 ml. In neuropediatric practice - 0.1–0.2 ml / kg. To increase the effectiveness of treatment, repeated courses can be carried out until the patient's condition improves as a result of treatment. After the first course, the frequency of prescribing doses can be reduced to 2 or 3 times a week. Doses from 10 to 50 ml are recommended to be administered only by slow intravenous infusions after dilution with the proposed standard solutions for infusion. The duration of the infusion is 15 to 60 minutes. Overdose: No cases have been identified. Special instructions: If injections are performed too quickly, a feeling of heat, sweating, dizziness may occur, so the drug should be injected slowly. The compatibility of the drug (within 24 hours at room temperature and in the presence of light) with the following standard solutions for infusion has been tested and confirmed: - 0.9% sodium chloride solution (9 mg NaCl / ml); - Ringer's solution (Na + - 153.98 mmol / l; Ca2 + - 2.74 mmol / l; K + - 4.02 mmol / l; Cl− - 163.48 mmol / l); - 5% glucose solution. Simultaneous administration of Cerebrolysin® with vitamins and drugs that improve cardiac circulation is allowed, however, these drugs should not be mixed in the same syringe with the drug Cerebrolysin®. Use only a clear solution and only once. Clinical trials have shown that Cerebrolysin® does not affect the ability to drive vehicles and use mechanisms. Storage: The temperature is not above 25 °C (77 °F). Do not freeze.

Email: grindeks@grindeks.lv Name in Cyrillic: Милдронат Active substance: Meldonium Meldonium is a structural analog of gamma-butyrobetaine, a substance that is placed in every cell of the human body. Pharmachologic effect: In high load conditions Meldonium restores the balance between the demand of cells for oxygen and its delivery to the cells, eliminates the accumulation of toxic metabolic products in cells, protecting them from damage; also has a tonic effect. As a result of its use, the body acquires the ability to withstand stress and quickly restore energy reserves. Due to these properties,Meldonium is used to treat various disorders of the cardiovascular system, blood supply to the brain, as well as to increase physical and mental performance. As a result of a decrease in the concentration of carnitine, gamma-butyrobetaine, having vasodilating properties, is intensively synthesized. In the case of acute ischemic myocardial damage, Meldonium slows down the formation of a necrotic zone, shortens the rehabilitation period. In case of heart failure, it increases myocardial contractility, increases exercise tolerance, and reduces the frequency of angina attacks. In acute and chronic ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation, Meldonium improves blood circulation in the ischemic focus, promotes blood redistribution in favor of the ischemic area. The drug eliminates functional disorders of the nervous system in patients with chronic alcoholism with withdrawal symptoms. Pharmacokinetics: Taken orally Meldonium is well absorbed. Bioavailability is about 78%. Cmax is achieved in 1-2 hours. The bioavailability after intravenous administration is 100%. Cmax in blood plasma is reached immediately after its administration. Meldonium is metabolized in the body with the formation of 2 main metabolites, which are excreted by the kidneys. T1/2 is 3-6 hours. Indications: complex therapy of ischemic heart disease (stenocardia, myocardial infarction); chronic heart failure and cardiomyopathy with dyshormonal disorders; complex therapy of acute and chronic disorders of the blood supply to the brain (stroke and cerebrovascular insufficiency); hemophthalmos and retinal hemorrhages of various etiologies, thrombosis of the central retinal vein and its branches, retinopathy of various etiologies (diabetic, hypertensive); reduced performance; mental and physical overload (including in athletes) (meldonium can cause a positive result during doping control (see \"Special instructions\"); withdrawal syndrome in chronic alcoholism (in combination with specific therapy). Contraindications: hypersensitivity to the components of the drug; increased ICP (with impaired venous outflow, intracranial tumors); pregnancy; lactation period; age up to 18 years (efficacy and safety have not been established). Use with caution: liver and / or kidney disease. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: The safety of use in pregnant women has not been studied, therefore, in order to avoid possible adverse effects on the fetus, use is contraindicated. Meldonium penetration  into milk  and its effect on the health of the newborn have not been studied, therefore, if necessary, breastfeeding should be discontinued. Side effects: Rarely - allergic reactions (redness, rash, itching, swelling), as well as dyspeptic symptoms, tachycardia, decrease or increase in blood pressure, agitation. Very rarely - eosinophilia, general weakness. Interaction: Can be combined with antianginal drugs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmic drugs, diuretics, bronchodilators. Meldonium strengthens the action of cardiac glycosides. Due to possible development of moderate tachycardia and arterial hypotension, caution should be exercised when combined with nitroglycerin, nifedipine, alpha-blockers, other antihypertensive drugs and peripheral vasodilators, because Meldonium enhances their effect. Dosing and Administration: CAPSULES : Due to the possible development of an exciting effect, it is recommended to use it in the first half of the day and no later than 5:00 p.m.  when taken several times a day.

The following doses are usually recommended: in children from 3 to 6 years old - 20-30 mg / day, from 6 to 10 years old - 30-60 mg / day, in children over 10 years old the maximum daily dose is 2.5 mg / kg of body weight; initial dose - 1.5-2 mg/kg of body weight. Cancellation of the drug is carried out gradually (within 1-2 weeks). Overdose: Symptoms: muscle hypotension, depression of the respiratory center, confusion of consciousness, coma (after the return of consciousness, muscle hypotension may persist for 72 hours). Treatment: drinking plenty of water, taking diuretics, with respiratory depression - mechanical ventilation. There is no specific antidote. Special instructions: Side effects are often transient in nature, they should be distinguished from the symptoms of the disease for which treatment is being carried out: with concomitant epilepsy, treatment is carried out without discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs. In patients with liver disease and diabetes, it is necessary to periodically monitor the activity of hepatic transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, as well as blood glucose levels. Patients taking Baclosan should refrain from potentially hazardous activities associated with the need for increased attention and rapid psychomotor reactions. Manufacturer: Polpharma (Poland) Write a review Please login to review Baclosan® in Cyrillic : Баклосан SUBSTANCE Baclofen DOSAGE FORM tablets MANUFACTURER Polpharma Out Of Stock 2 reviews / Write a review  Katena® | Buy online | Gabapentin (aka Neurontin) Katena® Description Instructions Reviews (2) Katena® Katena® is an antiepileptic drug, anticonvulsant. It is used to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Active substance: Gabapentin Pharmachologic effect: anticonvulsant Pharmacodynamics: Katena is an antiepileptic drug. According to the chemical structure, Gabapentin is similar to GABA, which acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The mechanism of action of gabapentin is believed to be different from other anticonvulsants that act through GABA synapses (including valproate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, GABA transaminase inhibitors, GABA uptake inhibitors, GABA agonists, and GABA prodrugs). In vitro studies have shown that gabapentin is characterized by the presence of a novel peptide binding site in rat brain tissues, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which may be related to the anticonvulsant activity of gabapentin and its derivatives. Gabapentin in clinically significant concentrations does not bind to other conventional drugs and neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, incl. with GABAA-, GABAB-, benzodiazepine receptors, with NMDA receptors. The mechanism of action of gabapentin has not been definitively established. Pharmacokinetics: Gabapentin is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, Cmax of gabapentin in plasma is reached after 2-3 hours. Absolute bioavailability is about 60%. Reception simultaneously with food (including those with a high fat content) does not affect the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin. Gabapentin does not bind to plasma proteins and has a Vd of 57.7 liters. In patients with epilepsy, the concentration of gabapentin in the cerebrospinal fluid is 20% of the corresponding plasma Css at the end of the dosing interval. Gabapentin is excreted only by the kidneys. T1 / 2 does not depend on the dose and averages 5-7 hours. Clearance of gabapentin is reduced in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function. The elimination rate constant, plasma and renal clearance of gabapentin are directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Gabapentin is removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Plasma concentrations of gabapentin in children are similar to those in adults. Indications: - treatment of neuropathic pain in adults over the age of 18; - monotherapy of partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and children over 12 years of age; - as an adjunct in the treatment of partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and children aged 3 years and older. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to gabapentin Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Adequate and strictly controlled studies on the safety of the use of gabapentin during pregnancy and lactation in humans have not been conducted. If necessary, use during pregnancy and lactation should carefully weigh the expected benefit of therapy for the mother and the potential risk to the fetus or infant. Gabapentin is excreted in breast milk. When used during lactation, the nature of the action of gabapentin on an infant has not been established. Side effects: Nervous system: amnesia, ataxia, confusion, impaired coordination of movements, depression, dizziness, dysarthria, increased nervous excitability, nystagmus, drowsiness, impaired thinking, tremor, convulsions, amblyopia, diplopia, hyperkinesia, strengthening, weakening or absence of reflexes, paresthesia, anxiety, hostility, gait disturbance. Digestive system: discoloration of the teeth, diarrhea, increased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, anorexia, gingivitis, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, changes in liver function tests. Hematopoietic system: leukopenia, a decrease in the number of leukocytes, thrombocytopenic purpura. Respiratory system: rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough, pneumonia. Musculoskeletal system: myalgia, arthralgia, bone fractures. Cardiovascular system: arterial hypertension, manifestations of vasodilation. Urinary system: urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence. Allergic reactions: erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Dermatological reactions: skin maceration, acne, itching, rash. Other: back pain, fatigue, peripheral edema, impotence, asthenia, malaise, swelling of the face, weight gain, accidental injury, asthenia, flu-like syndrome, blood glucose fluctuations, in children - viral infection, otitis media. Interaction: With simultaneous use with antacids, the absorption of gabapentin from the gastrointestinal tract decreases. With simultaneous use with felbamate, an increase in T1 / 2 of felbamate is possible. With simultaneous use, a case of an increase in the concentration of phenytoin in the blood plasma is described. Dosing and Administration: Katena capsules are taken orally, regardless of food intake, swallowing whole, drinking water. The dose should be selected individually, depending on the indication, age and condition of the patient. Dose reduction, withdrawal or replacement with alternative drugs should be done gradually over at least 1 week. Special instructions: Abrupt discontinuation of anticonvulsant therapy in patients with partial seizures may provoke status convulsions. If necessary, dose reduction, discontinuation of gabapentin or replacement with an alternative agent should be gradual over a period of at least 1 week. Gabapentin is not an effective treatment for absence seizures. When used together with other anticonvulsants, false-positive results of a urine protein test have been reported. To determine the protein in the urine, it is recommended to use a more specific method of precipitation of sulfosalicylic acid. Patients with impaired renal function, as well as patients on hemodialysis, require correction of the dosing regimen. Elderly patients may require correction of the gabapentin dosing regimen due to the fact that in this category of patients a decrease in renal clearance is possible. The efficacy and safety of neuropathic pain therapy in patients under 18 years of age have not been established. The efficacy and safety of gabapentin monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures in children under 12 years of age and additional therapy with gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures in children under 3 years of age have not been established. Avoid drinking alcohol during treatment. Before determining the individual response to treatment, the patient should refrain from potentially hazardous activities associated with the need for concentration and increased speed of psychomotor reactions.

It is one of most popular drugs in athletes who want to get rid of body fat without losing muscle mass. Clenbuterol is used medicinally to widen the airways and reduce shortness of breath. Works as a beta-2 agonist, similar to ephedrine. Release of fatty acids. Reduces adipose tissue by increasing the production of adrenaline. The person's temperature rises. The metabolism is accelerated. Appetite decreases. Suppresses the production of the catabolic hormone cortisol. That is, it helps prevent muscle breakdown. In addition, it has a weak anabolic property. But this is less pronounced than fat burning and anti-catabolic properties. All in all, Clenbuterol helps you burn fat while keeping your muscles from breaking down. The perfect combination for drying! Clenbuterol for weight loss: instructions for use Clenbuterol should be taken for two weeks, then 2 weeks break, and 2 weeks repeat again. It is better to drink it before lunch or dinner, dividing the dosage into two parts: The first day: take 20 mcg tablet The second day: take 40 mcg (2 tablets) The third day: take 60 mcg (3 tablets) The fourth day: drink 80 mcg (4 tablets) The fifth day: leave 100 mcg (5 tablets) From 6 to 12 days: take 100 mcg; Day 13: take 80 mcg; Day 14: take 40 mcg The daily dose of Clenbuterol for weight loss: 140 mcg - for men; 100 mcg - for women Combined uses with other drugs An excellent combination would be taking Clenbuterol at a dosage of 120-160mcg with Metformin (2500mg). Thus, these drugs manage to enhance the actions of each other. Clenbuterol in this case helps to eliminate the negative property of metformin, in particular, the feeling of fatigue. Anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone and testosterone also have the ability to enhance the effect of clenbuterol. It is recommended to combine the Clenbuterol with triiodothyronine only for experienced athletes. Pharmachologic effect: adrenomimetic, bronchodilator. Pharmacodynamics: Clenbuterol is a drug with a rapid bronchodilator effect. Its action is due to the specific stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscles. When bound to them, the enzyme adenylate cyclase is activated, which leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and activation of protein kinase A, and deprives myosin of the ability to combine with actin, resulting in relaxation of the bronchi. Clenbuterol stimulates the cells of the bronchial mucosa and enhances expectoration. At prescribed therapeutic doses, clenbuterol does not affect heart rate or blood pressure. Pharmacokinetics: Clenbuterol is relatively rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Communication with plasma proteins is 89-98%. The biological T1/2 is 3.5 hours. Clenbuterol is excreted mainly through the kidneys in the form of sulfo-conjugated derivatives. Indications: Bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and other lung diseases with broncho-obstructive syndrome. Contraindications: thyrotoxicosis; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; angle-closure glaucoma; pheochromocytoma; tachyarrhythmia; myocardial infarction (acute period); pregnancy (I and III trimester); lactation period; children's age up to 6 years; hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Use with caution: Use with caution immediately after a myocardial infarction, with liver and kidney failure, heart rhythm disturbances, myocarditis, mitral valve defects, hypokalemia, unstable or uncompensated diabetes. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Clenbuterol is contraindicated in the I trimester of pregnancy and just before birth. Side effects: Cardio-vascular system and blood: tachycardia, arrythmia, reduction or (more often) increase in blood pressure. Nervous system and sensory organs: the tremor of fingers, anxiety, headache. Digestive tract: dry mouth, nausea. Allergic reactions: skin rash, urticaria. Other: hypokalemia. Interaction: Beta-blockers inhibit the action of Clenbuterol, and when they are taken simultaneously, there is a risk of developing bronchospasm. The use of the drug simultaneously with hypoglycemic agents reduces their effect. Clenbuterol enhances the action and side effects of beta-agonists, theophylline and anticholinergics. With the simultaneous use of clenbuterol and halogenated hydrocarbons for anesthesia (with manipulations and interventions), there is an increased risk of arrhythmia. Clenbuterol can be used simultaneously with diuretics and cardiac glycosides, but with periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes. With simultaneous use with MAO inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants), cardiac arrhythmias are possible. Dosing and Administration: Adults and children over 12 years - 10-20 mcg 2-3 times a day, maintenance dose - 10 mcg 2 times a day. Young children - in small doses, depending on the age, 2 times a day. The duration of the course of treatment with Clenbuterol is 2-3 days, until the acute symptoms of the disease are relieved. The duration of maintenance therapy should not exceed 7 days. The decision on treatment for a period exceeding seven days is made by the attending physician. Overdose: Symptoms: tremor of the extremities, restlessness, tachycardia. Treatment: dose reduction, symptomatic therapy Special instructions: The drug contains the so-called parabens as excipients: methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate, which can cause urticaria and contact dermatitis (delayed-type allergic reactions). Rarely, immediate allergic reactions (bronchospasm) may occur. The drug contains glycerol as an auxiliary substance, which at high doses can cause headache, stomach irritation and diarrhea. The drug contains 0.63 vol.% of ethyl alcohol. Each dose contains 0.005 g of alcohol per 1 ml. It is dangerous for people with liver disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, brain damage or disease, as well as for pregnant women and children. May enhance the effect of other medicines. The drug is not suitable for patients with congenital fructose intolerance due to the presence of sorbitol in it. In the first days of treatment, clenbuterol can cause slight tremors and restlessness, which requires increased caution when driving a car and working with machinery.

Weight Choose an option 1 Gram 2 Grams 5 Grams Clear Tianeptine sulfate quantity Add to cart Tianeptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant, available under the trade names such as Stablon, Coaxil or Tatinol. While it is mainly used in the treatment of major depressive disorder, its other indications include anxiety disorders, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome. Tianeptine has been shown to display significant anxiolytic properties and as such is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder. In comparison with other tricyclic antidepressants, tianeptine is linked to fewer cardiovascular, anticholinergic, sedative and appetite-inducing adverse effects. Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of tianeptine are currently believed to be produced through indirect alteration and inhibition of glutamate receptor activity and the release of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). It is also hypothesized to protect against stress-induced neuronal remodelling. Tianeptine is known to moderately enhance the mesolimbic release of dopamine and potentiate its D 2 and D 3 receptors. Furthermore, tianeptine has been found to act as an atypical agonist of the μ-opioid receptor. Interestingly enough, studies on mice suggest that its opioid action is vital to its behavioral antidepressant-like effects. According to some studies, tianeptine might be slightly effective treatment for ADHD, reducing hyperactive behaviors and enabling greater attentional ability with minimal side effects. A recent fMRI study has provided the first evidence that tianeptine can shift atypical brain activation during executive functioning tasks in adults with autism spectrum disorder towards control levels. There are some disadvantages to the sodium form. Unlike many antidepressants, it has to be taken three times a day and is best absorbed when taken about 15 minutes before a meal, which, for many people, could be a challenging schedule to follow. While some people experience immediate benefits, it takes at least a week for its active metabolite to achieve stable blood levels and develop sustainable effects. Whereas there is no risk of addiction and withdrawal with doses within the normal therapeutic range, tianeptine sodium is known to induce a short-lived euphoria, causing the urge to re-dose. The sulfate form is designed to address the limitations and risks associated with its predecessor. It’s superior to sodium in terms of water solubility, so taking it on empty stomach isn’t likely to hinder its bioavailability. It has a significantly longer duration, and seems to be capable of producing consistent, low-key feelings of contentment and ease without that slowly fade away. With proper dosage schedule, tolerance development to such effects is negligible, but since they can be experienced upon a single administration, the sulfate form of tianeptine is also appropriate for ad hoc use. Benefits of taking tianeptine sulfate enhanced mood; anxiolytic effects; decreased impulsivity; enhanced concentration and focus; increased cognitive flexibility; reduced social anxiety; boost in motivation; anti-convulsant and analgesic effects. Side effects nightmares; abdominal pain; constipation; drowsiness; risk of addiction at doses well above the therapeutic range. Dosage As mentioned before, tianeptine sulfate can be taken with or without meals. It is typically dosed at 25 – 40 mg once or twice a day. As some users find its effects to be stimulating, it is advised not to take it in the evenings. Some users find that once the antidepressant effects of tianeptine sulfate are stable, they are able to reduce the dosage, while some prefer to take it on ad hoc basis when anticipating a particularly challenging and stressful day. ✕ Magnesium l-threonate Skip to the content Magnesium l-threonate € 8.60 – € 35.50 Price range: €8.60 through €35.50 Magnesium l-threonate SKU: magnesium-l-threonate ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Magnesium l-threonate ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS: – OTHER NAMES: Magnesium bis[(2 R ,3 S )-2,3,4-trihydroxybutanoate], MgT CAS NUMBER: 778571-57-6 ATC CODE: – FORMULA: C 8 H 14 Mg O 10 MOLAR MASS: 294.5 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: powder QUANTITY PER PACK: 20 grams to 100 grams STORAGE: Store in a room temperature. Keep away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep out of reach of children. SCOOPS: This product includes a measuring scoop (1 ml) = 700 mg (approximately). For precise measurement, we recommend using a laboratory scale. The product is not intended for human use. For collectors, hobbyists, education and research. Weight Choose an option 20 Grams 50 Grams 100 Grams Clear Magnesium l-threonate quantity Add to cart Magnesium L-threonate (MgT) is a unique form of magnesium that has gained attention for its potential nootropic and neuroprotective effects, particularly due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than other magnesium compounds. MgT is a chelated form of magnesium bound to L-threonic acid, which facilitates higher magnesium uptake into the brain compared to other forms (e.g., magnesium citrate or oxide). As a critical cofactor for NMDA receptor function, magnesium plays key role in learning and neuroplasticity. MgT is the only form of magnesium that has been proven to provide nootropic benefits postulated in theory; animal studies confirm its positive impact on synaptic density and learning curve. MgT may also promote BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) signaling, supporting neuronal growth and connectivity. Certain studies suggest that its prolonged use is linked with enhanced executive function, increased learning speed and greater working memory volume. It is believed to possess neuroprotective properties, potentially reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and preventing amyloid plaque accumulation. Magnesium deficiency is common in ADHD, and MgT may help regulate dopamine and glutamate signaling, improving focus and reducing hyperactivity, and its calming effects (via GABA modulation) might counteract insomnia and normalize sleep patterns. Furthermore, its NMDA-modulating effects might help with sensory processing and emotional regulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder; preliminary evidence also suggests that magnesium facilitates cognitive flexibility. Through HPA axis Modulation, MgT can potentially reduce cortisol and improve stress resilience, possibly also enhancing antidepressant effects of SSRI drugs. By regulating NMDA and GABA, it may support mood regulation, reduce hyper-excitability and fear conditioning, relevant for depression and PTSD. MgT may delay the onset of neurodegenerative changes by improving synaptic density. In fact, recent evidence suggests that magnesium modulates glutamatergic dysfunction in psychosis; normalizing its levels could therefore affect the course of schizophrenia. Benefits of taking magnesium L-threonate enhanced mood; lessened anxiety; improved executive function; increased neuroplasticity; enhanced working memory; steeper learning curve; neuroprotection; greater cognitive flexibility; boost in stress resilience. Side effects mild gastrointestinal discomfort. In cases of kidney dysfunction, it is advised to monitor magnesium levels. Dosage Only ca. 8,3% of magnesium L-threonate is elemental magnesium. In order to maximize its nootropic potential, it is advised to consume 25 mg of magnesium L-threonate per kilogram of body weight. ✕ Chlodantan - Zion Pharma Skip to the content Chlodantan (Chlodantane) € 19.50 – € 49.90 Price range: €19.50 through €49.90 Chlodantan (Chlodantane) from European lab.

For precise measurement, we recommend using a laboratory scale. The product is not intended for human use. For collectors, hobbyists, education and research. Weight Choose an option 1 Gram 5 Grams Clear Chlodantan (Chlodantane) quantity Add to cart Chlodantane is a novel research compound, closely related to a well-established, popular and versatile nootropic – bromantane. While the latter has gained recognition thanks to its atypical psychostimulant profile, c hlodantane seems to support and enhance resilience against various stressors in a robust manner, acting as a potent adaptogen. Multiple studies suggest that chlodantane may boost immune responses in a balance d manner , offering promising avenues for immunological studies. Research conducted so far highlights its capacity to e nhance resistance to environmental stressors, including facilitated recovery from states of hyperthermia and hypoxia (actoprotector properties). Furthermore, it seems to stimulate adaptive responses against physical and chemical noxious agents, and exhibit immunostimulatory effects that counteract susceptibility to stress-induced immunodeficiencies, often developed in chronic stress. Although the mechanisms of chlodantane’s adaptogen activity are yet to be studied in detail, one of the most important contributions observed is the increase in the stability of cell membranes with respect to unfavorable factors, achieved, in particular, by decreasing the rate of overactivating lipid peroxidation (LPO) processes. In contrast to the action of well-known and extensively described adaptogens, its effects often become aparent after a single administration.

Weight Choose an option 2 Grams 5 Grams 10 Grams Clear 4F-Phenibut (4-Fluorophenibut) quantity Add to cart 4-Fluorophenibut is a research chemical and a derivative of Phenibut. Phenibut [4-amino-3-(4-fluorophenyl)butyric acid] is a neuropsychotropic drug that was developed and introduced into clinical practice in Russia in the 1960s. It is known for its anxiolytic and nootropic effects. Similarly to pregabalin and gabapentin, phenibut acts as a strong VGCC (Voltage Gate Calcium Channel) blocker at the α2 subunit. In addition to that, phenibut exerts its therapeutic effects via its GABA-mimetic action, primarily at GABA-B and, to some extent, at GABA-A receptors. In that aspect, the psychopharmacological activity of phenibut is similar to that of baclofen, a p-Cl-derivative of phenibut. Furthermore, phenibut antagonizes β-phenethylamine (PEA), a presumed endogenous anxiogenic. It also stimulates dopamine receptors, which most likely accounts for its focus enhancing properties. Phenibut has been demonstrated to act as a neuroprotective agent in vitro, however the exact mechanism of action in this case remains unknown. In Russia, clinicians prescribe phenibut for tension, anxiety, and fear relief, to improve sleep improve sleep in psychosomatic or neurotic patients. It is also used as a pre- or post-operative medication, as well as in the treatment of disorders characterized by asthenia and depression, in post-traumatic stress, stuttering and vestibular disorders. In recent years, phenibut has gained its recognition worldwide as an anxiolytic and nootropic agent. According to anecdotal evidence, low-dose phenibut is particularly useful for achieving a clear-headed state of mind, enhanced focus and motivation, mood improvement, combating stress and social anxiety. Phenibut seems to have its unique profile that encourages socialization in a manner distinct from benzodiazepines (which merely increase socialization through disinhibition), in that it directly increases the urge to communicate with others. It is important to keep in mind that while phenibut is energizing and tends to increase libido at lower doses, it is highly sedative at higher doses. There are also reports from people who managed to quit drinking with the aid of phenibut. Bodybuilders and athletes use phenibut before resistance training, as studies show that raising GABA levels leads to increased secretion of human growth hormone (HGH). Benefits of taking phenibut lessened anxiety; deepened capacity to relax; boost in energy; enhanced mood; increased sociability; improved focus and concentration; enhanced motivation; increased libido; restful sleep; possible pre-workout aid; possible drinking cessation aid. Side effects Below side effects are likely to be experienced with exceedingly high doses. dizziness; nausea; fatigue; poor balance; reduced consciousness. Interactions alcohol; benzodiazepines; pregabalin; gabapentin. Dosage With phenibut, it’s important to start low, at 200-300 mg per day. Phenibut is best absorbed on empty stomach. It takes a longer while to work (up to 3 hours in some users), while its effects can be long-lasting (up to 16 hours), which is why it is of great importance to refrain from premature redosing. Since tolerance to its effects may develop, it is safe not to take phenibut more than three times a week and never exceed 2-3 grams per day. Phenibut is not meant for long-term daily use, as in such cases dependence may develop. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, agitation, depression, cognitive deficits, fatigue and depersonalization. In more severe cases, vomiting, heart palpitations, tremor, insomnia, and visual and auditory hallucinations might be experienced. ✕ 9-Me-BC powder - Zion Pharma Skip to the content 9-Me-BC € 39.00 – € 129.00 Price range: €39.00 through €129.00 9-Me-BC powder SKU: 9-me-bc ACTIVE INGREDIENT: 9-Me-BC OTHER NAMES: 9-Methyl-β-carboline; 5-Methyl-5 H -pyrido[3,4- b ]indole; 9-Methylnorharman; 9-MBC; N -Methyl-β-carboline; CAS NUMBER: 2521-07-5 ATC CODE: – FORMULA: C 12 H 10 N 2 MOLAR MASS: 182.225 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: powder QUANTITY PER PACK: 0.5 gram to 2 grams STORAGE: Best stored in original, tightly sealed packaging, at temperature 2-8 o C.

Weight Choose an option 0.5 Gram 1 Gram 2 Grams Clear 9-Me-BC quantity Add to cart 9-Me-BC ( 9-Methyl- β -carboline ) is an experimental nootropic compound of the β-carboline family which has been investigated for its neuroprotective and restorative properties for dopaminergic neurons and dopamine pathways and has shown very promising results. A study on rats has demonstrated impressive effects of this substance on the proliferation of dopaminergic neurons. Administration of 9-Me-BC not only resulted in a substantial increment of granulosa cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but also in the development of robust dendritic features, contributing to the formation of elaborate networks. Although the initial structural changes corresponding to the elevation of dopamine levels within the hippocampus and improved performance of the test subjects on tasks involving spatial memory became fully apparent, suggesting the complexity of the transformations taking place. One of the mechanisms that 9-Me-BC is thought to promote is, widely considered to be one of the bottlenecks in the dopamine synthesis pathway, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. In one study, 9-Me-BC has also proven exceptionally effective in promoting the differentiation of cultures of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, activating high levels of transcription factors associated with their development. 9-Me-BC also exhibits pronounced anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by damaged neurons and inhibiting the oxidation of the neurotoxin precursor MPTP to its more harmful form, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium). Those findings are of utmost importance, in the face of growing evidence for the role of neuroinflammation in the development of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Like harmaline or harmine from the Banisteriopsis caapi plant, familiar to Ayahuasca enthusiasts, and β-carboline contained in tobacco, 9-Me-BC possesses MAOI (monoaminoxidase inhibitor) properties. Due to its anti-inflammatory qualities and MAO-B activity, it is currently being investigated for the treatment of Parkinson’s and might also benefit those who suffer from post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. It is important to note that 9-Me-BC acts as a far more potent MAO-A inhibitor, and as such could potentially be an extremely effective and versatile antidepressant. Benefits of taking 9-Me-BC improved working- and long-term memory; enhanced focus and learning; boost in motivation; recovery from the drug induced damage from dopamine excitotoxicity; (stimulants, entactogens); improved motor coordination; enhanced mood; increased libido; improved spatial orientation; neuroprotection and neuro-regeneration. Side effects possible DNA damage after UV-A exposure (skin protection advised); dopamine toxicity at above the recommended dosage; irritability; anxiety; insomnia. Interactions other MAOIs ; SSRI / SNRIs ; TCAs: imipramine, clomipramine ; stimulants ; at above 30 mg /day, foods high in tyramine (more details in this publication , or its shorter version ) . Dosage The recommended dosage for 9-Me-BC ranges from 5 to 75 mg per day in two divided doses or in a single dose. It is advised not to take the substance in the evening due to the risk of insomnia, more prevalent with higher doses. Generally, 9-Me-BC acts mainly as a nootropic at low-to-moderate doses. At above ~30-40 mg, its MAOI properties become more pronounced, and 9-Me-BC is expected to acts as an antidepressant. ✕ Agmatine sulfate powder - Zion Pharma Skip to the content Agmatine sulfate € 6.90 – € 39.00 Price range: €6.90 through €39.00 Agmatine sulfate SKU: agmatine-sulfate ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Agmatine sulfate OTHER NAMES: 4-aminobutyl-guanidine, Guanidine, N-(4-aminobutyl)-, N-(4-Aminobutyl)guanidine CAS NUMBER: 2482-00-0 ATC CODE: – FORMULA: C 5 H 14 N 4 MOLAR MASS: 228.272 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: powder QUANTITY PER PACK: 10 grams to 100 grams STORAGE: Best stored in original, tightly sealed packaging, at temperature 2–8°C.

Weight Choose an option 10 Grams 20 Grams 50 Grams 100 Grams Clear Agmatine sulfate quantity Add to cart Agmatine was discovered in 1910 by Nobel Prize winner Albrecht Kossel as a naturally occurring compound. Despite over a hundred years since its discovery, its action on the nervous system remained relatively unknown until the recent decades, when its properties became a subject of scientific interest. When L-arginine undergoes decarboxylation, a process that results in the removal of a carboxylic acid group, it becomes agmatine sulfate. This compound is stored in the neurons of the brain and released when those neurons are activated, which sets it apart from its amino acid counterpart. Agmatine acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system. It binds to various receptors, including imidazoline, α2-adrenergic, and NMDA receptors, to modulate neurotransmitter release, nitric oxide production, and synaptic plasticity. It appears to interact particularly strongly with glutamate receptors and certain pathways, where agmatine levels have been shown to increase in the regions of the brain involved in learning. Studies suggest that agmatine sulfate may promote healthy levels of oxidation, partly due to its ability to limit glutamate activity, thus acting neuroprotective against excitotoxicity. High glutamate levels have also recently been linked to anxiety and depression, conditions the symptoms of which agmatine helps alleviate, as mentioned in numerous anecdotal reports. A glutamate-GABA imbalance in favor of the former is also what is believed to characterize the nervous system in autism spectrum disorder, which is consistent with recent study results, where remarkably lower plasma agmatine level were found in patients with ASD compared with the control group. As NMDA antagonist, agmatine has been shown to reverse tactile hypersensitivity in rodent models of neuropathic pain. While it is capable of inducing analgesia to some extent, it has also been found to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine by modulating the opioid system. Furthermore, agmatine has established its reputation in the bodybuilding community for its ability to create huge muscle pumps via Nitric oxide regulation. In addition to that, agmatine has vasodilative properties by acting as a calcium antagonist. While further research on the matter is required, preliminary animals studies have yielded promising results as far as the treatment of alcohol addiction is concerned. Agmatine supplementation resulted in a decrease of withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and anxiety. Benefits of taking agmatine enhanced mood; decreased anxiety; reduced pain; improved blood flow; neuroprotection; enhanced neuroplasticity; possible aid in drug use cessation; potentially alleviates the symptoms of ASD; may promote lean muscle growth and muscle definition; anticonvulsant effects; potentiation of certain substances; increased glomerular filtration rate (better kidney function). Side effects nausea; gastrointestinal discomfort; vomiting; diarrhea; mild drop in blood pressure. Contraindications Individuals with kidney disease or ulcers should consult their doctor prior to using agmatine. Agmatine may interact with blood pressure, anti-diabetic medications and medications that affect liver function. Dosage A typical daily dose of agmatine sulfate ranges from 500 to 2500 mg per day, usually split into several smaller doses spread throughout the day. It is ingested orally, in capsule or powder form. Some individuals found that they tolerate it better when they take it with food. ✕ Allopregnanolone Skip to the content Allopregnanolone € 38.80 Allopregnanolone SKU: allopregnanolone ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Allopregnanolone ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS: – OTHER NAMES: ALLO; ALLOP; SAGE-547; SGE-102; 5α-Pregnan-3α-ol-20-one; 5α-Pregnane-3α-ol-20-one; 3α-Hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one; 3α,5α-Tetrahydroprogesterone; 3α,5α-THP, brexanolon; CAS NUMBER: 516-54-1 ATC CODE: N06AX29 FORMULA: C 21 H 34 O 2 MOLAR MASS: 318.5 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: powder QUANTITY PER PACK: – STORAGE: Best store in a room temperature and dry place. Keep away from direct sunlight and heat.

The product is not intended for human use. For collectors, hobbyists, education and research. Weight Choose an option 0.5 Gram Clear Allopregnanolone quantity Add to cart A potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, allopregnanolone (or 3α-Hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one) binds to a specific site distinct from benzodiazepines, dramatically increasing the channel’s opening frequency and duration in the presence of GABA. This leads to profound neuro-inhibition. At nanomolar concentrations (EC50 ~100-400 nM), it can potentiate GABA-induced chloride currents by over 150%. The FDA-approved formulation, Brexanolone (Zulresso®), is administered as a continuous IV infusion over 60 hours for postpartum depression, demonstrating a significant mean reduction in the HAM-D score (~14-19 points) vs. placebo (~12 points). Allopregnanolone is the Mother of Silence, the Restorer of the Fractured Moon; the Alchemist who turns the lead of shattered nerves into the gold of serene presence. It is not a key that unlocks a door, but the quiet rain that falls on a parched and cracked earth. It does not shout over the brain’s alarm bells; it simply convinces the air that there is no need for sound. It is the endogenous sigh of relief, the neurosteroid embodiment of the phrase “and it was so.” In a world of screaming neurotransmitters, allopregnanolone is the gesture that stills the orchestra, not by command, but by a profound, collective intake of breath. It is the wisdom that the deepest healing is not an addition, but a homecoming—a return to the baseline hum of a system at peace with itself. It is the proof that the most potent peace is the one your own body already knows how to brew. It whispers to the overstimulated mind: “The storm is over. You can lower the shields now. You are safe here, within yourself.” It is not a vague “calming essence”; it is a defined steroidal structure that physically alters the quantum probability of a transmembrane ion channel, hyperpolarizing the neuron and raising the threshold for action potential firing. The silence is electrochemical. Its potency is its primary risk. As an ultra-potent GABA-A modulator, the main side effects are those of excessive sedation: drowsiness, dizziness, and somnolence. This is why the commercial formulation (Zulresso®) required a 60-hour monitored IV infusion in a certified healthcare facility. In a small subset of individuals, it can cause unexpected mood shifts like agitation, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. This underscores that the brain’s response to neurosteroids is deeply individual. The potential for tolerance and dependence is a subject of ongoing study, but its mechanism suggests this is a possibility with chronic, unmanaged use. Currently, allopregnanolone is also being investigated for Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), bipolar depression, and PTSD. The theory is that these conditions may involve a “neurosteroid deficiency,” and allopregnanolone acts as replacement therapy for the brain’s own dampened calming systems. Its soothing effects might target the symptoms of ADHD related to impulsiveness and restlessness. As such, it is also likely to provide the necessary support for those who struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Its soothing effects encourage rest, and its common-sense, earthly, GABA-ergic profile prevents perfectionism from causing more harm than good. What might initially seem somewhat paradoxical, it actually discourages procrastination by removing the anxiety factor from the equation and replacing it with a healthy, serene, and well-balanced “can do” attitude, filling one’s mind with inner peace, faith in individual’s potential, inner trust and building their realistic, yet, positive self-image. What is more, allopregnanolone seems a promising candidate drug for another hormone-related condition: Catamenial Epilepsy, seizures tied to the menstrual cycle, where a pre-menstrual drop in progesterone (and thus allopregnanolone) is a trigger. It is only rational to anticipate its efficacy in this role. Its potent GABA-ergic effects are extremely likely to alleviate the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder related to sensory processing difficulties, hyper- and hyposensitivities, as well as social anxiety. Furthermore, pre-clinical models show remarkable neuroprotective effects, reducing brain inflammation and promoting recovery. It’s seen as a “reset” for the hyper-excited, inflamed post-injury brain. An intriguing 2021 study showed that a single injection of a novel, long-lasting allopregnanolone analogue produced rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects in animal models, lasting for weeks. This points to a future where the “60-hour infusion” bottleneck could be overcome, revolutionizing its use. Benefits of taking allopregnanolone extremely effective in the treatment of post-partum depression; powerful anxiolytic effects; supports overall well-being; facilitates relaxation; promotes calm, mild optimism; fosters positive self-image; gently, yet effectively discourages procrastination; supports realistic, positive self-esteem; lessens social anxiety; empowers self-compassion and self-care; encourages healthy ambition (as opposed to perfectionism); reduces hyperactivity and impulsiveness; potential aid in the treatment of bipolar disorder; probably the most effective drug for Catamenial Epilepsy; may have a calming, soothing effects needed in individuals with PTSD; potentially alleviates the symptoms of ASD; very likely to relieve the symptoms of treatment-resistant depression; promising candidate drug for traumatic brain injury (TBI); neuroprotective effects. Side effects Allopregnanolone is generally well-tolerated, however, in high doses, the following adverse effects might develop. That said, they are less likely to occur when administered orally. drowsiness; dizziness; sedation. Dosage Allopregnanolone might be dosed orally at 50 mg, once daily. It is recommended not to exceed the dose due to the potency of this compound. ✕ Alpha-GPC 98% Skip to the content Alpha-GPC 98% € 12.60 – € 43.00 Price range: €12.60 through €43.00 Alpha-GPC powder 98% SKU: alpha-gpc ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Alpha-GPC 98% OTHER NAMES: L-Alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine, choline alfoscerate, α-GPC, glycerophosphocholine CAS NUMBER: 28319-77-9 ATC CODE: N07AX02 FORMULA: C 8 H 20 N O 6 P MOLAR MASS: 257.224 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: powder QUANTITY PER PACK: 10 grams to 50 grams STORAGE: Best stored at 2-8 o C in a sealed package in a dry place .

Weight Choose an option 10 Grams 20 Grams 50 Grams Clear Alpha-GPC 98% quantity Add to cart Over the recent years, alpha-GPC, a compound naturally occurring in human brain and a fatty acid found in soy lecithin and other plants, has gained significant recognition and popularity among nootropic users. As a choline source (and technically a prodrug to acetylcholine), it is by far the most bioavailable one when it comes to central nervous system due to its rapid absorption and blood-brain barrier crossing capacity. This is what enables its promising effects on the central nervous system and the reason why it has been investigated for its potential for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. It is only logical and expected that its consumption should have positive impact on cognitive performance, including but by no means limited to memory, learning, focus, verbal fluency, and executive function. In a 2003 double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial published in Clinical Therapeutics , patients treated with 400-milligram capsules of a-GPC showed consistent improvement in cognitive impairment after 90 and 180 days, whereas in the placebo group it remained unchanged or deteriorated. Another study indicates that alpha GPC supplementation might be beneficial for healthy young adults in terms of mental and physical performance on par with caffeine, without its most prominent side effect commonly known as jitteriness. Speaking of which, some people experience the action of alpha-GPC as mildly stimulating and energizing. Interestingly enough, it has been observed to improve stamina, power output and muscle strength and as such is highly popular among athletes. As if being a superstar among choline sources weren’t enough, multiple studies suggest that alpha GPC elevates human growth hormone, which might amount to its effects and explain its impressive profile of a high-efficacy, broad-spectrum compound. Furthermore, there is also scientific evidence for Alpha-GPC being able to increase dopamine levels, particularly in individuals with dopamine deficiency. Benefits of taking alpha-GPC improved memory and learning; boost in energy and stamina; better focus and attention; enhanced verbal skills; increased visual and auditory acuity; enhanced executive function; increased athletic performance; boost in motivation; reduced folate and vitamin B12 deficiency; anti-inflammatory action; lower blood pressure; increased iron absorption; reduced liver fat and protection against liver damage; possible aid in drug use cessation; vivid dreams; might improve stroke recovery. Side effects Alpha-GPC is generally well tolerated and does not produce significant adverse effects when taken in moderation (the below are likely to be observed with high doses over a prolonged period and indicate that one should reduce its intake). headaches; nausea; alteration of body odor; heartburn; diarrhea; foul-smelling stool; dizziness. Dosage While some people benefit from doses as low as 250 mg per day, it seems that more observe cognitive improvement with doses ranging from 400 to 1200 mg. The most typical scenario involves a 400 mg dose in the morning and a second 400 dose early in the afternoon. Due to its stimulating properties, it is advised not to dose it in the evening. Individuals susceptible to gastrointestinal side effects might prefer to take alpha-GPC with food. ✕ Aniracetam powder - Zion Pharma Skip to the content ANIRACETAM € 9.10 – € 52.00 Price range: €9.10 through €52.00 Aniracetam SKU: aniracetam ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Aniracetam OTHER NAMES: Ampamet, Memodrin, Pergamid, 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-, 1-(4-Methoxybenzoyl)-2-pyrrolidinone, Draganon CAS NUMBER: 72432-10-1 ATC CODE: N06BX11 FORMULA: C 12 H 13 NO 3 MOLAR MASS: 219.24 g·mol −1 ITEM TYPE: Powder QUANTITY PER PACK: 10 grams to 100 grams STORAGE: Store at room temperature.

Weight Choose an option 10 Grams 20 Grams 50 Grams 100 Grams Clear ANIRACETAM quantity Add to cart Aniracetam is among the piracetam derivatives best-known for its anxiolytic and antidepressant properties with a rather unorthodox stimulant and cognitive profile. Like other members of the racetam family, aniracetam raises acetylcholine levels, but that statement alone doesn’t begin to exhaust its known mechanisms of action. It was actually the first AMPA-kine (allosteric positive modulator of the AMPA receptor) to be discovered. What distinguishes it from many subsequently developed compounds of the AMPA-kine class, though, is its favorable safety profile and low incidence of highly unpleasant side effects. Interestingly enough, whereas it also acts as a serotonin and dopamine releaser in the pre-frontal cortex and is a weak MAO-A inhibitor, its GABA-enhancing action via N-type calcium channel inhibition provides a counterbalance to the formerly stimulant described effects, which accounts for their unusually smooth profile. Furthermore, aniracetam facilitates interhemispheric transfer through the corpus callosum. As for its neuroprotective qualities, studies have also proven its capacity to increase brain metabolism especially under deficit conditions, such as that resulting from chemical toxicity, hypoxia, or impaired cerebral microcirculation. In rodents, it has been found to lower latent inhibition, which basically means the animals un-learned their response to a familiar stimuli and acquired new ones more readily. This could potentially account for greater cognitive flexibility and enhanced creative thinking in humans. In some countries, aniracetam is used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including senile dementia, Alhzheimer’s, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia following stroke and ADHD. Other than the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, which seem partly due to novelty enhancing properties of aniracetam, its users commonly report gains in motivation, memory focus, increased verbal fluency and overall processing speed. Aniracetam is similar to another racetam – coluracetam, in that it consistently produces sensory enhancement (i.e., “HD Vision”, but also enriched auditory and olfactory sensations in some people). There are also anecdotal testimonies of aniracetam facilitating immersion and the state of mindfulness. Some users note that become better in multi-tasking and attention switching “on demand”, while other find it particularly beneficial for holistic thinking, social anxiety or sociability in general. Considering those particular effects, it could be hypothesized that individuals with autism spectrum disorder might find that it addresses their cognitive difficulties in a unique, yet very adequate, manner. Benefits of taking aniracetam lessened anxiety; enhanced mood; better focus and learning capacity; increased sociability; enhanced senses; boost in energy; better multitasking skills; increased cognitive flexibility; enhanced creativity; boost in processing speed; increased thought connectivity; mental rejuvenation; immersion and mindfulness.

Contact Us Guaranteed Delivery Times We kindly wish to inform you that there may be occasional delays in delivery, which are not always within our control due to external factors. However, we always make a commitment to compensate your order (refund, reship, or store credit) if it is not delivered. Since this is not always predictable and we cannot influence the delivery times in some cases, we have established maximum delivery times (see below). We consider an order lost if these deadlines are exceeded.

You decided not to use the product that was shipped and delivered to you in good quality . We understand that you may change your mind to use a product for various personal reasons.

The tracking shows that the order is delivered but the customer claims that they have not received it. In such cases we recommend to contact your local postal service for clarifications.

Your order will only be subject to 100% reshipment / refund / store credit if it was damaged during the transit or didn’t make it to your country, due to unforeseen problems with our warehouse or our customs.

ATH code: [LO3A] Pharmacological properties: Active ingredient of pills Licopid ® - Glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) - is a synthetic analogue of the structural fragment of the envelope (peptidoglycan) of bacterial cells. GMDP is an activator of innate and acquired immunity, enhances the body's defense against viral, bacterial and fungal infections; has an adjuvant effect in the development of immunological reactions. The biological activity of the drug is realized through the binding of GMDP to the intracellular receptor protein NOD2, localized in the cytoplasm of phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells). The drug stimulates the functional (bactericidal, cytotoxic) activity of phagocytes, enhances their presentation of antigens, the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, increases the synthesis of specific antibodies, and contributes to the normalization of the balance of Th1 / Th2 lymphocytes towards the predominance of Th1. Pharmacological action is carried out by enhancing the production of key interleukins (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon, colony-stimulating factors. The drug increases the activity of natural killer cells. Licopid® has a low toxicity (LD50 is more than 49,000 times the therapeutic dose). In the experiment with the oral route of administration in doses 100 times higher than the therapeutic, the drug has no toxic effect on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems and does not cause pathological changes on the part of the internal organs. Likopid® does not have embryotoxic and teratogenic effects, does not cause chromosomal, gene mutations. In experimental studies conducted on animals, data were obtained on the antitumor activity of Licopid® (GMDP). Pharmacokinetics: Bioavailability of the drug by oral administration is 7-13%. The degree of binding to blood albumin is weak. Time to reach maximum concentration (t max ) - 1.5 hours after admission. Elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) - 4.29 hours.

Before starting treatment, the patient should be warned about the need to go to a doctor when a fever, sore throat, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth, boils, as these manifestations can be symptoms of agranulocytosis. 1-2 weeks before the operation, thiamazole should be canceled and continue preparation for strumectomy with iodine-containing preparations.

GUARANTEE & EXPIRY DATE 100% Original pharmacy product from Dutch Takeda Pharma A/S. DESCRIPTION Amitriptyline is an antidepressant tricyclic class of compounds derived from dibenzocycloheptadiene. The mechanism of antidepressant action is associated with an increased concentration of noradrenaline (noreprinephrine) in the synapses and/or in the central nervous system due to reverse neuronal capture of these mediators. After long-term use, Amitriptyline produces a reduction in brain beta-adrenergic and serotonin receptors function, normalizes adrenergic and serotonergic transmission, restores the balance of these systems, impaired in depressive states. This medication helps to reduce anxiety, agitation and depressive symptoms in patients with anxiety-depressive disorders. Amitriptyline has also an analgetic effect associated, as it believed, with changes in the concentration of monoamines in the central nervous system, especially serotonin, and the influence on the endogenous opioid system.

Read more How to Increase Energy Production with Age | AgelessRx Skip to content Search for: Here’s what we’ll cover in this blog post: The connection between energy and aging Why mitochondria are your body’s secret powerhouses How ATP keeps you feeling young and vibrant Easy tips to keep your energy levels high as you age Ever feel like aging is slowly draining your energy? What if you could hang onto that same energy you felt when you were twenty and increase energy production as you age? According to the energy maintenance theory of aging , it’s possible! The key lies in keeping your cells energized, as those who age best have cells that excel at maintaining energy production over time. The driving force behind this energy? Your mitochondria—the powerhouses of our cells . These tiny engines produce ATP—the fuel your body needs to repair, grow, and keep your muscles and brain in top shape. As we age, our mitochondria slow down. Less ATP means less energy, and soon our bodies feel like they’re running on a low battery. This can show up as weaker muscles, brain fog, and a higher chance of illness. The good news? If we keep our mitochondria healthy, we can stay sharp, strong, and energized for years to come. But what exactly happens to our mitochondria as we age, and how does it impact the aging process? Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Aging Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging . As we age, our mitochondria weaken, unlike the pristine powerhouses you’d find in a toddler’s cells. Damaged mitochondria struggle to produce enough energy, leading to fatigue and other signs of aging. When our cells can’t produce the energy they need, everything slows down—immune function, metabolism, and even brain performance. However, improving mitochondrial efficiency can not only help our bodies keep up with life’s demands, but it may even slow down the aging process. Feeling Fatigued? It Might Be a Bigger Deal Everyone gets tired, but chronic fatigue could signal a bigger issue. Fatigue can be an early warning sign of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or even cancer. What’s going on behind the scenes? It might be a lack of cellular energy with declining ATP production that’s driving that ongoing tiredness. By improving mitochondrial health and working to boost ATP production, you can give your body the energy it needs to fight fatigue and stay resilient against disease as you age. Whether with supplements or lifestyle changes, supporting ATP synthesis can help you feel more energy and even slow down the effects of aging. How Can You Boost Mitochondrial Health? With easy lifestyle changes, you can boost your mitochondrial health and increase energy production: Exercise Regularly : Physical activity generates new mitochondria and strengthens the existing ones. Keep moving with activities like walking, yoga, or weight training. Eat a Balanced Diet : Fuel your cells with antioxidant-rich foods like leafy greens, fish, and nuts. These nutrients support mitochondria and overall health while giving us more energy. Manage Stress : Chronic stress can damage mitochondria. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to keep stress levels in check. Consider Select Treatments and Supplements : NAD+ , B12 , Coenzyme Q10, magnesium, or alpha-lipoic acid can all be beneficial in supporting energy production and mitochondrial health. Recharge Your Batteries with Expert Help Optimizing your energy levels as you age doesn’t have to be a solo mission. Sometimes, we all need a little assistance—especially when it comes to something as important as your long-term health. A longevity specialist (like our team at AgelessRx) can help tailor a plan with the right balance of diet, exercise, and supplements. If you’re looking to increase your mitochondrial health and optimize your energy for years to come, try scheduling a longevity consultation with an AgelessRx prescriber. You can also explore our expert-curated energy and fatigue treatments, like NAD+ or B12 injections, both of which have been shown to potentially help improve energy  for more healthy, life-filled years.

LDN 0.5 vs 1.5: What to Know Before You Buy | AgelessRx Skip to content Search for: Quick overview of what we’ll cover in this blog post: What to know before you buy LDN Why AgelessRx offers 2 starting doses The difference between 0.5mg & 1.5mg Who should start at which dose What to do if you want a different dose What to Know Before You Buy LDN Naltrexone is an enigmatic treatment whose benefits vary depending on which dosage you’re receiving. Just by the name alone, we can tell that Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is on the lower end of this spectrum, and its ideal use strays significantly from higher doses – namely, in how it affects our longevity. But the name shouldn’t suggest that there’s a single dose of LDN that’s considered the low dose. In fact, anything under 10mg of Naltrexone can be considered LDN. This begs the question: just how low do the doses go, and which dose is right for me? These questions are what drove us at AgelessRx to offer multiple starting doses for LDN. Below, we discuss the differences between these starting doses (0.5mg and 1.5mg), so you can make the most informed decision with your prescriber about what might be best for you. Here’s what to know before you buy LDN. Why the Low Dose? Many medications have different effects (and therefore different uses) when prescribed at higher or lower doses, and LDN is no exception. Naltrexone is most often prescribed to treat certain addictions at doses ranging from 50-150mg. When prescribed at these doses, Naltrexone acts as an antagonist to temporarily block the effects of certain drugs and naturally occurring dopamine, as well as the release of dopamine (the reward signal associated with drug addiction). When used at lower doses, though, Naltrexone appears to have a paradoxical effect that allows the brain to produce more endorphins, which help to improve pain relief. Additionally, lower doses of Naltrexone may also prevent overactivation of immune cells in the body and the brain (known as T-cells and microglia respectively), thereby blunting the destructive consequences of chronic inflammation. For these benefits, Naltrexone is prescribed at 9mg/day or under. The most common dose is usually 4.5mg/day, at which most users experience the greatest benefits with th"

You will find that our pharmacy can save you up to 50% or more on your local drug store prices for non-prescription drugs. Now with our affiliate pharmacies we can offer an increased range of products at some of the best possible pharmaceutical buying power World-wide. What is Kiwi? Kiwi is your own International online pharmacy. We are proud to offer many popular drugs, medicines and general healthcare items at fantastic competitive pharmacy prices. Our professional team assures you that your medicines will be packed, shipped and delivered to your home in express time! Kiwi is a secure online shopping site that uses the best encryption software and you can be safe in the knowledge that Kiwi is backed by a network of successful pharmacies in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, the USA, Canada and India. Seeing an opportunity to provide quality, cheaper over-the-counter pharmacy products globally our Internet pharmacy was created and has been keeping international customers satisfied since its inception. How can I be sure Kiwi is legitimate? Kiwi initially operated solely from a large New Zealand pharmacy store that has been established for over 40 years. As a New Zealand pharmacy, we are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand and the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. Our pharmacists are registered with the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand. Our pharmacy is audited on a regular basis by Medsafe (the New Zealand medicines control authority), in accordance with the laws of operating a New Zealand pharmacy. You can be safe in the assurance that our pharmacy has passed all the requirements of the Medsafe authority.\r\n\r\nOur pharmacists are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand. The Pharmaceutical Society is the professional body for New Zealand pharmacists. The Society provides professional support, education, training and career development for all pharmacists, assisting and enabling them to deliver best practice and professional services for the public.\r\n\r\nAs we are a full retail and dispensing pharmacy, we are also members of the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. The Pharmacy Guild provides member pharmacies and pharmacists with a diverse range of services designed to support and enhance the commercial and professional interests of community pharmacy.\r\n\r\nIn order to become a qualified pharmacist in New Zealand, there is a requirement of a minimum of four years University study, followed by a full year of on-site training. Only once the trainee intern is fully appraised at the end of this fifth year (by means of practical examinations), can they be certified as a qualified pharmacist. All pharmacists in New Zealand must undergo continuing education, meaning that they must continue to actively learn and study during their career as a pharmacist.\r\n\r\nOur affiliate pharmacies are all licensed and regulated pharmacies in their jurisdiction and their service and support is guaranteed. When reading reviews, make sure to read from a site that verifies the reviewer is a real customer, such as Trustpilot. How am I able to buy prescription medicines without seeing my doctor? Kiwi operates its online doctor service from countries, such as the UK, where the online doctor service is regulated and the doctors and pharmacies we work with are regulated and approved to provide online doctor consultations in those regions. Kiwi Drug's Doctor Service is not intended to replace the care of your primacy care physician. We have a policy that customers must consult their regular physician in order to initialize treatment. Evidence of previous physician authorization of ordered products is required in order for the pharmacy and medical team to confirm your order.

As a New Zealand pharmacy, we are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand and the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. Our pharmacists are registered with the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand. Our pharmacy is audited on a regular basis by Medsafe (the New Zealand medicines control authority), in accordance with the laws of operating a New Zealand pharmacy. You can be safe in the assurance that our pharmacy has passed all the requirements of the Medsafe authority. Our pharmacists are members of the Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand. The Pharmaceutical Society is the professional body for New Zealand pharmacists. The Society provides professional support, education, training and career development for all pharmacists, assisting and enabling them to deliver best practice and professional services for the public. As we are a full retail and dispensing pharmacy, we are also members of the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand. The Pharmacy Guild provides member pharmacies and pharmacists with a diverse range of services designed to support and enhance the commercial and professional interests of community pharmacy. In order to become a qualified pharmacist in New Zealand, there is a requirement of a minimum of four years University study, followed by a full year of on-site training. Only once the trainee intern is fully appraised at the end of this fifth year (by means of practical examinations), can they be certified as a qualified pharmacist. All pharmacists in New Zealand must undergo continuing education, meaning that they must continue to actively learn and study during their career as a pharmacist. Our affiliate pharmacies are all licensed and regulated pharmacies in their jurisdiction and their service and support is guaranteed. Trust pilot “Kiwi Clinic has been an incredible find.

Returns for convenience are not accepted, as most products cannot be re-dispensed to other patients once they are returned. We will replace any defective or incorrect shipment if we are notified within 30 days of delivery (14 days for fridge-line items). This is partly due to the fact at this point the item will have been in the custody of the patient longer than the fulfillment location or postal carrier. Past this point we will only replace items which are proven to have been expired at the time of delivery, or before the patient would be able to use it based on their daily dosage. Prices are subject to minor changes according to international currency rates. Availability of products is subject to change without further notice. We are not responsible for dispatchment delays caused by temporary delays in the delivery of the requested product/products from the manufacturer/supplier or by any other unforseeable delays.

This can happen once or twice per year. During an audit, there may be delays in shipping orders. We are not responsible for these delays but you may cancel your order if it has not yet shipped. Order cancellations are not accepted after the order has been shipped. We have zero tolerance for chargebacks or bank disputes. We are more than happy to reship something that is lost, or refund if a reship is no longer possible.

You will know when you enter a secure page such as when entering your payment; because the lock icon on your web browser becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. Although we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything possible to protect your information offline. All of our customer information is restricted.

We may also maintain a file containing contact history that is used for customer inquiry purposes. We may collect anonymous/non-personal information.

In some instances such as a legal proceeding or court order, we may also be required to disclose certain information to authorities. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we will take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities who are making the request have legitimate grounds to do so.

Get consultation Womens’s health Men’s health Weight loss All themes FAQ How am I able to buy prescription medicines without seeing my doctor? Kiwi operates its online doctor service from countries, such as the UK, where the online doctor service is regulated and the doctors and pharmacies we work with are regulated and approved to provide online doctor consultations in those regions. Kiwi's Doctor Service is not intended to replace the care of your primacy care physician. We have a policy that customers must consult their regular physician in order to initialize treatment. Evidence of previous physician authorization of ordered products is required in order for the pharmacy and medical team to confirm your order. If there are any concerns the online doctor will ask you via chat after placing your order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Zealand Customers please note: We recommend that you visit your local pharmacy for prescription services as you will most likely qualify for subsidized medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will need to provide a valid New Zealand prescription for this. Are all prescription medications available from Kiwi through the online doctor? No - only prescription medications listed and marked as \"online doctor\" or with the \"Dr\" symbol next to them do not require a current prescription to be sent in, OR any over the counter item (marked \"OTC\"). If a prescription medication is only available in New Zealand for example, we cannot ship it from there without a current prescription on file for every order/shipment. We can change orders after being placed to their online doctor counterparts, but only if such a counterpart exists (for example in the UK), and any price difference would be the responsibility of the customer, as costs vary from country to country. Does the medication ship with the online doctor prescription inside? No, we are not allowed to send the prescription in the shipment to the customer. This is partly to prevent double-use of the same prescription. It is kept on file with our fulfilling pharmacy only. If you have a domestic (from the shipping destination country) prescription you would like us to include in the shipment to help it across the border, you must advise us prior to ordering. We try to ship orders as promptly as possible. Keep in mind it can take 1-2 business days for such requests to be resolved, as they require escalation. Does Kiwi charge an online doctor consultation fee? Kiwi does not charge for its online doctor consultation, when it is part of an order with items that will ship to a customer. Most sites charge over 25GBP/30USD per order for this consult fee, but Kiwi does not. If you want to consult with the doctor apart from placing an order for shipment, then there is a fee for that.

Join us in celebrating our 40th anniversary — a journey built on partnership, innovation, and people. Like the timeless sci-fi journeys of the 80s, our story combines nostalgia with a vision for the future of discovery! Our Journey Through The Decades Over four decades, we’ve grown, adapted, and achieved together with our customers and team. Here’s a look back at the moments that made Delta what it is today. Lift Off for Delta Scientific 1985 In 1985, Ken McGuinness, Larry Drago, and Frances Widmar took a bold leap of faith in Sudbury, Ontario, launching Delta Scientific to supply fire assay and lab products to the mining industry. Like Flash Gordon blasting off into uncharted worlds, their vision set the course for decades of discovery and progress. The Catalogue Strikes Back 1992 Delta publishes its first catalog, bringing order and clarity to its expanding portfolio. Much like a celebrated sequel, it symbolized confidence, visibility, and growth across Canada’s scientific supplies community. Mission HQ 1997 Delta purchases its first Mississauga headquarters, establishing a true home base. Echoing the maiden voyage of a Star Trek starship, this marked the beginning of Delta’s next chapter of expansion and development. ISO: A Science Odyssey 2001 Delta achieves ISO 9001 certification, proving its commitment to rigorous quality. This badge of trust aligned Delta with the precision of a science odyssey, strengthening its position as a dependable partner. Facility Awakens 2012 Delta moves into a modern Mississauga facility, expanding warehousing, logistics, and team capacity. As with a long-awaited sequel, this milestone rejuvenated Delta, delivering faster service and positioning it for future success. Hear From The People Behind Delta Anthony Bertucci Customer Service Manager “The atmosphere of friendship and family permeates our inner walls. We truly care for our clients.” Anthony started at Delta in 1992 and is Delta’s longest tenured employee. His positive attitude has made him a favourite among Delta’s customers.\" Sawmi Nadesapillai Portfolio Manager “Delta didn’t just offer me a job — they offered me understanding, flexibility, and trust.” Mike Thibeau Commercial Lead “I have worked for large and small companies in this industry, but never for one that respects and values its employees, suppliers, and customers in the way that Delta Scientific does.” Valeska Taylor Account Representative “One of my fondest memories is Anthony always calling with what he thought was bad news — but to me, it meant another customer had said yes. At Delta, we celebrate every ‘yes’ more than we worry about the bumps along the way” Discover the Full Story Explore Delta’s journey in detail with our 60 Years Digital Booklet, including staff stories, milestones, and insights into the future of scientific supply.

Ficin cleaves mouse immunoglobulin G molecules (IgG1) in the hinge region. The concentration of cysteine changes how ficin cleaves IgG1. A F(ab’)2 fragment is formed in the presence of 1mM cysteine. The F(ab’)2 fragments are smaller than whole IgG molecules and better penetrate tissue for antigen recognition while avoiding unspecific binding to Fc receptors. In the presence of 10mM cysteine, two 2 Fab fragments are produced instead. F(ab) fragments block background from primary antibody binding, and block endogenous and exposed immunoglobulins and tissues in labeling experiments. Immobilized Ficin Agarose Resin offers a convenient solution to the production of F(ab’)2 and Fab fragments while eliminating autolysis and protease contamination and the need to remove the enzymes following digestion. Fab and F(ab’)2 can be further separated from whole IgG with either Protein A Agarose Resin (GoldBio Product # P-400) or ion exchange chromatography.

In particular, papain cleaves immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules near the hinge region of the antibody, resulting in three similar, ~50 kDa, fragments; an Fc domain and two monovalent Fab domains. This papain-digested antibody is therefore unable to promote agglutination, precipitation, opsonization or lysis. The Fc fragment can then be used to determine the specificity of the Fc receptors without any typical antigen binging interference while the Fab fragments can be used in immunohistochemical studies.

It is most efficient in cleaving the peptide bonds between hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. Pepsin readily cleaves immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules, generating F(ab’)2 fragments and small Fc peptide fragments. The smaller Fc fragments can be easily removed via gel filtration while the F(ab’)2 fragments can then be purified from any remaining, undigested IgG. The F(ab’)2 fragments are highly useful for research interests, being able to penetrate tissue better than standard IgG antibodies and facilitate better antigen recognition while avoiding unspecific binding to Fc receptors. Immobilized Pepsin Agarose Resin is an efficient method for producing F(ab’)2 fragments from IgG molecules for antibody mimetic. Undigested IgG can be quickly removed with our Protein A Agarose Resin (GoldBio Catalog # P-400) . Fc fragments can also be removed using a gel filtration system.

It is a bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amine buffer that is useful for a pH range of 6.4 – 7.8. It is soluble in water at 0°C up to 3.2M. Like most neutral, amine-based buffers, BES forms a complex with DNA. It interferes with reactions between DNA and restriction enzymes to a lesser extent than similar buffers with less substituted amine groups, such as Tris. This lack of interference occurs because steric hindrance of the protonated tertiary amine in BES shields the negative charge of DNA to a lesser extent than less substituted buffers. BES can be used in a buffered saline solution in the calcium phosphate mediated transfection of eukaryotic cells with plasmid DNA. BES also forms a complex with certain metals, including copper and cobalt. Though BES binds to coppers ions, it is still suitable for use with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Diminished protein-induced color development can be accounted for or even eliminated by precipitating protein prior to reaction with bicinchoninic acid.

Transporter Dopamine Transporter DAT; SLC6A3 Dopamine Transporter Related Products PDF 0.37 MB Dopamine transporter (DAT) is a plasma membrane protein that mediates the reuptake of extracellular dopamine (DA) and controls the spatiotemporal dynamics of dopaminergic neurotransmission. DATs play a key role in terminating dopaminergic signalling and in maintaining a releasable pool of dopamine. DATs help to modulate the concentration of extraneuronal dopamine by actively shuttling released transmitter molecules back across the plasma membrane into dopaminergic neurons, where they can be sequestered for later reuse or enzymatic catabolism. DAT is a principle target of various psychostimulant, nootropic, and antidepressant drugs, as well as certain drugs used recreationally, including the notoriously addictive stimulant cocaine. DAT ligands have traditionally been divided into two categories: cocaine-like inhibitors and amphetamine-like substrates. DAT is regulated by multiple signaling systems, such as PKC.

Home Cell Adhesion Targets Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) Cell adhesion is the essential biological process by which cells attach to one another and to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex network of proteins providing structural and biochemical support. This interplay underpins tissue development, maintenance, immune surveillance, and wound healing through a tightly regulated cascade of molecular interactions. Specialized transmembrane proteins collectively known as Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) mediate these contacts, coupling mechanical linkage with intracellular signaling. CAMs are therefore pivotal targets in biomedical research and therapeutic development. Key Targets in Cell Adhesion AJUBA AKT1 AKT2 AKT3 AMOT ANK3 ANTXR2 ANXA1 ANXA6 APC ASTN2 CAV1 CAV2 CD151 CD99 CDC42 CDH1 CDH10 CDH19 CDH5 CFL1 CLDN18 CLEC4A CNTN1 CSNK2A1 CTNNA2 CTSB CTSD CTSG CTSH CTSK CX3CR1 DIAPH1 DIAPH2 DNM1 ESAM F11R FBLN5 FOXA1 FOXA2 Schematic representation of the structure of four major classes of cell adhesion molecules. ‎ (\"Cell adhesion in cancer: Beyond the migration of single cells - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate, licensed under CC BY 4.0 . The original figure can be found here ) Cadherins Cadherins are calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoproteins that primarily mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion, promoting the cohesion of similar cell types essential for tissue architecture and morphogenesis. Their extracellular domains contain multiple cadherin repeats that coordinate Ca²⁺ binding, which rigidifies the structure and enables adhesive dimerization. Beyond adhesion, cadherins engage intracellular catenins that link to the actin cytoskeleton and participate in signaling pathways regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. Key Research Target: E-cadherin (CDH1) The loss or dysfunction of E-cadherin is a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis by facilitating tumor cell detachment and invasion. Investigating E-cadherin status using antibodies in immunohistochemistry (IHC) or ELISA quantification remains fundamental in cancer diagnostics and research. Emerging Target: N-cadherin (CDH2) During \" cadherin switching \" cancer cells downregulate E-cadherin and upregulate N-cadherin, promoting motility and invasiveness. Small molecule inhibitors targeting N-cadherin are being explored to block metastatic progression, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF) IgSF CAMs are a large, diverse group of calcium-independent proteins mediating both homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling. Their Ig-like domains confer structural versatility, supporting roles beyond adhesion to include immune modulation and neural development. Key Research Targets: ICAM-1 (CD54) and VCAM-1 (CD106) These molecules are critical in inflammation, mediating firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium, a prerequisite for immune cell transmigration. Tools such as soluble VCAM-1 ELISA kits and monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 enable the study of endothelial activation and leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Emerging Target: L1CAM (CD171) Overexpression of L1CAM is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers by enhancing migration and invasion. Antibody-drug conjugates targeting L1CAM exemplify promising cancer therapeutic strategies. Integrins Integrins are heterodimeric receptors composed of α and β subunits that physically connect the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the ECM. This linkage facilitates bidirectional signaling—outside-in signals regulate cell survival, proliferation, and motility, while inside-out signals modulate integrin affinity and avidity for ligands. Key Research Target: Integrin αvβ3 Highly expressed on activated endothelial and tumor cells, αvβ3 integrin orchestrates angiogenesis, sustaining tumor growth. Antibodies and RGD peptides that mimic natural ligand motifs are key tools to probe and inhibit this process. Emerging Target: Integrin α4β7 Crucial for lymphocyte homing to the gut, α4β7 integrin is a validated therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases. Small molecule inhibitors and antibodies blocking α4β7 have shown efficacy in controlling these conditions. Selectins Selectins are calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding lectins mediating transient, low-affinity interactions that enable leukocytes to roll along the vascular endothelium during inflammation—an essential early step in immune cell recruitment. Their extracellular regions feature C-type lectin domains specialized for glycan recognition, with rolling facilitated by dynamic “catch-slip” bond behavior tuned to shear forces. Key Research Targets: P-selectin (CD62P) and E-selectin (CD62E) Expressed rapidly on activated platelets and endothelial cells respectively, these selectins initiate leukocyte capture and rolling. Research tools include antibodies that block selectin function and ELISA kits measuring endothelial activation. Emerging Target: P-selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1) The principal leukocyte ligand for P- and E-selectin, PSGL-1 also transduces intracellular signals that activate integrins during rolling. Recombinant PSGL-1 proteins serve as decoys, while antibodies are employed for leukocyte characterization and functional assays. References Khalili, A. A. (2015).

Despite being classified as a psychostimulant, it is distinct from others in its class. Any perceived stimulatory effects are mild, and studies report decreased anxiety among subjects [1]. This has made Bromantane a hugely interesting compound, though it was neglected for many years for unknown reasons. In Russia it was used under the name “Ladasten” for the treatment of asthenia, which is similar to chronic fatigue syndrome. In a study of over 700 patients, it was concluded that Ladasten was not only safe but even lacked side effects [1]. Western medicine has paid little attention to Bromantane, however Algernon Pharmaceuticals is now investigating it for its antifibrotic, kidney-protective effects. We hope to encourage such research by allowing researchers to buy Bromantane. Pharmacology Bromantane’s mechanism is thought to be like that of Amantadine’s: Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition [4]. Similarity is shared not only in downstream effects, but chemical structure. High dopamine biasedly enforces synaptogenesis in D1-containing direct medium spiny neurons, and this creates an imbalance with D2-containing indirect medium spiny neurons. Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition, however, corrects this, therefore improving disorders such as dyskinesia, psychosis and other detriments caused by abnormally high dopamine. The anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds indirectly inhibit histone deacetylases, and this gives rise to neurotrophins such as BDNF and especially GDNF. As seen in Parkinson’s patients, GDNF injections had benefits lasting up to 3 years after stopping, maybe explaining Bromantane’s dopaminergic effect which lasts for 2 months after discontinuation. Reduced neuroinflammation and increased neurotrophins also functions as a dual protective measure against neurotoxicity in dopamine neurons. Bromantane’s benefit to athletic ability may be multifaceted: it may draw influence from the central nervous system as described above, but it may also be secondary to testosterone and/ or tissue oxygenation. Like Bemethyl (Metaprot), Bromantane is in a class of compounds called “actoprotectors”, primarily known for their antihypoxic effects. And like Bemethyl, both are antioxidants, which is believed to underlie these effects (albeit Bromantane a stronger antioxidant). This could be how Bromantane improves testosterone, although the marked reduction to cortisol could also play a role. This combined with the increase in GABA is likely what gives Bromantane an anxiolytic effect. Pharmacokinetics Bromantane is mistakenly publicized as having a 42% oral bioavailability, however its absolute bioavailability is only 27.5% [5]. Due to having a wide volume of distribution, its accumulation in lower organs (such as the liver) reduces its availability to the brain, which in isolation has a half life of 7 hours[5]. It is metabolized by cytochrome P450, into less dopaminergic, more anticholinergic compounds, however the LD50 is still especially high at 8100mg/kg[5].

Buy Tropisetron | Working memory nootropic | Read more: Background Tropisetron is an α7 nicotinic partial agonist with superior effects to GTS-21, which was shown to enhance cognition in healthy people [1]. Additionally it is a 5-HT3 antagonist which have a long history of benefits to mental health. Acting synergistically, 5-HT3 antagonism prevents nausea induced by α7 nicotinic partial agonism, while simultaneously giving it a dual nootropic effect. α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonism is neuroprotective and non-addictive, with literature suggesting the cognition enhancement by nicotine may be owed to this receptor, without the euphoric effects. This receptor is also responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine, and more selective agonists for a7 such as GTS-21 (or Tropisetron) are much stronger. Outside of the US, Tropisetron is a pharmaceutical. As such it has a wealth of human data, where it was shown repeatedly to be well tolerated, with little to no side effects. It is normally prescribed for chemotherapy-induced nausea in cancer patients, however it has been used experimentally with success as an analgesic in Fibromyalgia [2] and general treatment for Schizophrenia [3], where it was found to be quite successful. Tropisetron was also successful when tested for OCD [4]. Tropisetron trends to decrease anxiety in some studies, but with less efficacy than a benzodiazepine [5]. Its potential benefits to ADHD and depression are yet to be elucidated, but some preclinical data hint it may be advantageous. We hope to encourage such research by allowing researchers to buy Tropisetron. Pharmacology α7 nicotinic partial agonism increases calcium influx, but simultaneously prevents hyperactivation of the receptor, giving Tropisetron neuroprotective and pro-cognitive abilities. Increasing acetylcholine potentiates the nootropic effect of Tropisetron, and increasing cAMP potentiates its theoretical antidepressant effects in animal models. 5-HT3 antagonism produces a nootropic effect, in part by increasing acetylcholine release. Pharmacokinetics Tropisetron has superior pharmacokinetics with 60% oral bioavailability and a 6hr half life but duration that supersedes that.

Buy Citicoline (CDP-Choline) | Choline source | Read more: Background Citicoline is held in high regard as one of the best choline sources.[1] Choline, once an acetyl group is donated to it, forms acetylcholine which is an important neurotransmitter for memory. This is how Citicoline improves learning in aged volunteers.[2] What separates Citicoline or CDP-Choline from other choline sources is that it’s less likely to generate TMAO,[1] which is known to be associated with heart failure. This is why Alpha-GPC, but not Citicoline increased stroke risk by 800%.[3] Choline is an important dietary nutrient that some are deficient in, and acetylcholine is a primary target in preventing Alzheimer’s. Increasing acetylcholine has been shown to enhance the memory improvement by other nootropics, such as Tropisetron and Piracetam. We hope to encourage research by allowing researchers to buy Citicoline. Pharmacokinetics Citicoline’s oral bioavailability is nearly 100%, and it is well absorbed.

Primarily it is being investigated under the name Visomitin, and for its potential to benefit to ocular function. However, SkQ1 appears a promising candidate for the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis[4] and other unrelated conditions. We hope to encourage research by allowing researchers to buy SkQ1. SkQ1 works similarly to CoQ10, but with superiority in multiple regards: it is both extremely potent and less prone to exacerbating oxidative stress. CoQ10 is well recognized for promoting heart health, reducing cancer risk and being protective against cognitive decline. Indeed, SkQ1 is shown to prevent the formation of β-amyloids.[5] Pharmacology In studies, SkQ1’s antioxidant modes reflect its reduction to SkQ1H2 at Complex I IQ or Complex III Qi site. Both reductions diminish electron diversions to oxygen thus attenuating superoxide formation. Resulting SkQ1H2 oxidizes back to SkQ1 at the second (flavin) Complex I site, previously indicated for MitoQ10. SkQ1 works similarly to that of COQ10 (popularly known as MitoQ) but presents less pro-oxidant activity. It shows downstream anti-inflammatory effects and protective effects in various models. Pharmacokinetics Current data suggests that oral administration of SkQ1 is inadvisable, with sublingual or buccal administration producing better results. SkQ1, used topically or injection to the organ of interest, is also described in rat models as a procedure to protect from damage.

Despite this, TBG lacks recreational value as well as hallucinogenic effects, separating it from the analogue act. This is evidenced by a lack of head twitch in rodent models.[1] TBG lacks concrete data elucidating its mechanisms, but it is thought to influence neurogenesis similarly to a psychedelic.[1] So far, TBG appears a promising candidate both for substance abuse disorders and depression.[2] References [1] Tabernanthalog does not induce head twitch, rescues mice from stress. Neurogenic cause: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01159-1 [2] Tabernanthalog for substance abuse and depression: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7874389/ Disclaimer Scientific discussion is purely for educational purposes.

They are being investigated for their potential to increase protein synthesis, improve bone density, and regulate metabolic processes. Researchers have observed that SARMs' effects are similar to steroids. However, their side effects and working mechanisms are different. At Purerawz , we offer a variety of SARMs for research purposes. You can order these SARMs in bulk as well as they help you with your research and investigation. What do SARMs do? Researchers have found that SARMs work by selectively binding to AR (androgen receptor) in skeletal muscle and bone tissues in experimental models. Once bound to these receptors, SARMs may promote protein synthesis, muscle fiber growth, and potential bone density support. Since SARMs have a selective nature, they try to limit unwanted androgenic stimulation in non-muscle tissues such as the liver and prostate. Purerawz has a Huge Collection of SARMs and SARM Stacks. We do not want you to quickly switch our site just to find out your preferred SARM. Therefore, we provide you with a wide variety of SARMs and their stack. Below is the list of SARMs that you will find in our online shop. YK-11 (Myostatin) Andarine S-4 OTR-AC S-23 RAD-140 + S-23 Transdermal Apart from these SARMs, we provide you with high-quality research chemicals, including Nootropics , Peptides , PCT products , and research stacks . Disclaimer The products at our online shop are only for research purposes. They are not approved for human or animal use. Before purchasing any product from us, ensure to have a look at our terms & conditions and shipping & returns policy . FAQs How does Purerawz ensure the quality of SARMs? Our SARMs undergo third-party lab testing and come with Certificates of Analysis (COAs) to verify purity and quality. How are SARMs different from anabolic steroids? Unlike traditional anabolic compounds, SARMs are being studied for their selective receptor activity. SARMs may reduce non-target interactions in experimental settings. How should SARMs be stored? For research integrity, SARMs should be stored in a cool, dry environment, away from direct sunlight, and as per the product label instructions. Can I track my SARM order from Purerawz? Yes. All orders come with tracking information once processed and shipped. Notifications Products On Sale We are offering the following products on sale. Hurry up before the sale ends!

They are the short versions of proteins found in the body. Peptides perform necessary biological functions such as regulating hormones, neurotransmitters, and enzymes. They boost collagen, muscle growth, and help with wound healing. The synthetic version of peptides is designed to help researchers assess their effects on research models. This research is conducted on experimental models under controlled laboratory settings. How do peptides work? Different peptides work differently in experimental models. However, here is a general breakdown of how they may work: 1. Cell Signaling Peptides work as important messengers. They bind to receptors on the cell surface and trigger specific cellular responses such as growth, repair, or metabolic changes in research models. 2. Protein Precursors In a few experimental models, peptides have been shown to act as intermediates in the formation of larger proteins. These proteins then appear to support essential functions, including tissue structure, enzyme activity, and cell repair. 3. Hormone and Neurotransmitter Mimicry A few of the peptides have exhibited hormone-like or neuromodulatory properties once they bind to particular receptors. By doing so, they may influence appetite, growth, immune response, or synaptic transmission in research models. One thing that you may want to know about peptides is that their function always depends on their sequence and structure, since even a slight change in amino acid order can change their function.

Disclaimer The products at our online shop are only for research purposes. They are not approved for human or animal use. Before purchasing any product from us, ensure to have a look at our terms & conditions and shipping & returns policy . FAQs How should peptides be stored? Peptides should be stored in a cool, dry environment, away from direct light and moisture. Do peptides require refrigeration or freezing? Yes, peptides refrigeration (2–8 °C) or freezing (–20 °C) is advised to maintain integrity for long periods. How stable are peptides after reconstitution? Researchers have observed that once reconstituted, peptides are less stable and should be used promptly. However, if storage is necessary, keep aliquots frozen to minimize degradation. Are the peptides third-party tested? Yes, all peptides undergo third-party testing to ensure accuracy, consistency, and quality.

Researchers have observed that nootropics may have stimulating effects in different experimental models. How Do Nootropics Work Different research on Nootropics has suggested that they may work by influencing various pathways in the brain of research models. These pathways are believed to be linked with memory, learning, and mental energy in preclinical models. Nootropics' working mechanism varies greatly. However, most work through one or more of these pathways. 1. Neurotransmitter Modulation Researchers have found that nootropics may affect acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, important brain chemicals in research models. By increasing or simply balancing the levels of these chemicals, nootropics may boost memory, motivation, and focus in research settings. Moreover, there have been reports that some nootropics may protect brain cells from oxidative stress and toxins in preclinical studies. They might do so by enhancing antioxidant activity or stabilizing cell membranes in preclinical models. 2. Improved Blood Flow & Oxygen Delivery Several nootropics have been shown to increase cerebral circulation in research models. When cerebral circulation increases, the neurons get more oxygen and nutrients. 3. Neuroplasticity Some nootropics have been shown to work by promoting growth factors like BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor). Research has indicated that this may support synapse formation and learning ability in preclinical models. Besides, nootropics like Adaptogenic may regulate stress hormones (like cortisol) in research models. This might help the brain stay calm and resilient under pressure.

To preserve their effectiveness, nootropics should be stored in a cool, dry environment, away from direct sunlight. They should also be kept away from heat and moisture. Do nootropics require refrigeration or freezing? Researchers have found that most nootropics in capsule or powder form do not require refrigeration; they can usually be stored at room temperature. However, certain liquid or more delicate nootropic compounds may benefit from refrigeration to maintain stability. How stable are nootropics after reconstitution? If a nootropic comes in powder form and is reconstituted into a liquid solution, its stability typically decreases, as observed in research models. It is best to prepare only what is needed for immediate use. Are the nootropics third-party tested? Yes, reputable suppliers ensure nootropics undergo third-party testing to confirm purity, consistency, and quality before they are made available.

Disclaimer The products at our online shop are only for research purposes. They are not approved for human or animal use. Before purchasing any product from us, ensure to have a look at our terms & conditions and shipping & returns policy . FAQs How should PCT products be stored? PCT compounds should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. If you don’t want your PCT product to degrade soon, make sure to keep the lid tightly closed. Do PCT need refrigeration or freezing? Most PCT products in capsule, tablet, or powder form do not require refrigeration as they remain stable at normal room temperature. Preliminary studies have indicated that freezing is not recommended, as it may damage some ingredients. What is the shelf-life of most PCT products? Different PCT products have different shelf-life, for instance: Tablets/Capsules (SERMs, AIs, herbal PCT): Around 24–36 months. Liquid Solutions (if available): Typically 12–24 months, as liquids degrade faster than solid forms. Powdered Compounds: About 2–3 years, provided they’re sealed tightly and kept away from humidity.

PiPTapentadol is used medically for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is highly addictive and is a commonly abused drug. Like tramadol, PiPtapentadol affects both the opioid system and the norepinephrine system to relieve pain. Unlike tramadol, it has only weak effects on the reuptake of serotonin and is a significantly more potent opioid with no known active metabolites. The potency of Piptapentadol is somewhere between that of tramadol and morphine, with an analgesic efficacy comparable to that of oxycodone despite a lower incidence of side effects. The CDC Opioid Guidelines Calculator estimates a conversation rate of 50mg of PiPtapentadol equaling 10 mg of oral oxycodone in terms of opioid receptor activation.

It is closely related to other compounds such as brorphine and SR-17018. Similarly to brorphine, SR-14968 shows robust biased agonist activity in vitro, but in animal studies in vivo behaves more like a typical opioid agonist at higher dose ranges, though still with a superior safety profile compared to unbiased agonists such as fentanyl. Compounds of this class are under development as potential analgesic medications with lower risk of overdose and drug dependence compared to traditional opioid drugs This product is intended for laboratory research purposes only and are not to be used for any other purposes.

In Conclusion: Reviewing the Key Points about Ivermectin Recap of Essential Information about Ivermectin Importance of Responsible Use of Ivermectin Introduction to Ivermectin Ivermectin, a medication developed in the 1970s by Japanese microbiologist Satoshi Ōmura and Irish pharmacologist William C. Campbell has proven to be highly effective in treating parasitic infections in recognition of their groundbreaking discovery of a new therapy against roundworm parasites. Ōmura and Campbell were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 for their discovery. Ivermectin has been widely used to treat various parasitic infections in humans and animals. Its effectiveness against numerous parasitic diseases led to its inclusion in the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines. Brief History and Discovery With a tremendous dedication to their research endeavors Satoshi Åmura and William C. Campbell undertook a profound investigation during the 1970s through their meticulous analysis of soil samples sourced from Japan. They unexpectedly made a groundbreaking discovery. Hidden within these samples lay an exceptional bacterial strain capable of producing an extraordinary avermectin compound. The unrivaled efficacy demonstrated by avermectin in combatting parasites that precipitate river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis propelled further scientific investigations. Consequently, Ivermectin emerged as a derivative compound receiving authorization for human usage in 1987. Its invaluable contributions encompass the comprehensive treatment of various parasitic infections afflicting the human population and animal kingdom. Overview of Ivermectin's Role in Modern Medicine Ivermectin is mainly prescribed for treating parasitic infections like river blindness (onchocerciasis). Strongyloidiasis and scabies. Its mechanism of action involves paralyzing and eliminating the parasites responsible for these infections in recent times. There has been a growing interest in utilizing Ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, it is essential to note that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using Ivermectin exclusively within clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment. Composition of Ivermectin Key Ingredients and Their Role Ivermectin is a compound derived from avermectin, which is naturally produced by Streptomyces avermitilis through fermentation. The active component in Ivermectin is 22,23 dihydroavermectin B1a. Its mechanism of action involves binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels found in both nerve and muscle cells of parasites, as a result. There is an increased influx of chloride ions into these cells. It was ultimately leading to cellular hyperpolarization and paralysis of the parasites. Understanding the Formulation Ivermectin is offered in various forms, including tablets, creams, lotions, and injectable formulations. The appropriate dosage and formulation will vary depending on the specific infection being treated as well as the age and weight of the patient. III. Mechanism: How Ivermectin Works Detailed Description of Ivermectin's Mechanism of Action The action mode for Ivermectin involves binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels within the nerve and muscle cells found in parasites; through this mechanism, there is a notable increase in the influx of chloride ions into these cellular structures. It causes them to undergo hyperpolarization, ultimately leading to paralysis in the parasites it affects. However, it is imperative to recognize that Ivermectin's effectiveness does not extend to all parasites. Its optimal efficacy is witnessed specifically against nematodes (roundworms) and arthropods (insects and spiders). The Significance of Ivermectin’s Mechanism in Treatment The mechanism of action of Ivermectin is highly significant as it specifically targets the nervous system of parasites. As a result, it proves to be an effective treatment for parasitic infections that primarily impact the nervous system, including river blindness (onchocerciasis) and strongyloidiasis. IV. Approved Uses of Ivermectin Parasitic Infections Treated by Ivermectin Ivermectin is a medication primarily used to treat parasitic infections, including river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, and scabies. It is also employed in managing other parasitic infections such as lymphatic filariasis, head lice, and threadworms (pinworms). Intestinal strongyloidiasis. External ear mites in dogs and cats. Sarcoptic mange in dogs and heartworm disease in dogs and cats as a preventive measure. Drugs.com National Center for Biotechnology Information World Health Organization Exploring Other Approved Medical Indications In veterinary medicine, Ivermectin has obtained authorization for treating parasitic infections in animals. Furthermore, there exists keen interest in exploring its potential application against COVID-19. Nonetheless, it is crucial to observe the guidance provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), which advocates judiciousness and specifies that Ivermectin should exclusively be used as an intervention for COVID-19 through rigorous clinical trials. Drugs.com National Center for Biotechnology Information World Health Organization V. Off-label Use of Ivermectin Common Off-label Uses in Different Medical Conditions Ivermectin is an FDA-approved drug used to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. Some topical forms of Ivermectin are also approved to treat external parasites such as head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea. However, the FDA has warned against using Ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends that the drug only be used within clinical trials for COVID-19 patients. Research indicates that Ivermectin has potential effectiveness in managing epilepsy seizures or mitigating the impact of cancer progression. It is also under investigation for its role in controlling HIV/AIDS spread and treating malaria and tuberculosis infections. Here are some references that you can check out for more information: 1. Ivermectin: Uses, dosage, side effects, warnings, and more 2. Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19 3. WHO advises that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials Review of Research on Off-label Use There has been significant research conducted on the off-label use of Ivermectin. However, further investigation is required to ascertain its efficacy in treating these conditions. VI. Dosage and Administration of Ivermectin Standard Dosage for Different Age Groups and Conditions Ivermectin is a medication used to treat various conditions caused by parasites. The ivermectin dosage depends on the patient's age and the specific condition being treated. The standard dosages for different age groups and conditions are as follows: - For the treatment of strongyloidiasis, a dose of 200 mcg/kg of body weight is recommended as a single dose. - When treating onchocerciasis, a dose of 150 mcg/kg of body weight is recommended as a single dose. - For scabies treatment. Taking a single dose of 200 mcg/kg of body weight is advised. - Similarly. For head lice treatment. The recommended dosage is also 200 mcg/kg of body weight taken as a single dose. How to Administer Ivermectin Safely and Correctly Depending on the specific condition being treated, Ivermectin may be administered orally or topically. To ensure optimal results, it is crucial to carefully adhere to the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist when consuming ivermectin and taking the medication with a full glass of water on an empty stomach at least one hour before any meal is recommended. VII. Ivermectin: Side Effects and Management Common Side Effects: What to Expect Ivermectin, like other medications, may have specific side effects.

Have ordered from them several times, with no problems at all. Have gotten COVID 3 times, and each time ivermectin took it down. Have learned that the dosage must be high enough to stop the replication of the virus, and you must continue to take it for several days. If the dosage is not high enough or you don't take it long enough, the symptoms will return. Luckily, ivermectin is an exceedingly safe drug (safer than Tylenol, Aleve, Advil, and other OTC drugs). Most doctors in the U.S. have abandoned their COVID patients, so I am very appreciative and thankful to have Buy-Pharma providing ivermectin and other life-saving drugs to everyone around the world.

Because it is inactivated by 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in skeleta musculos, it is considered a weak androgen. Its lack of substrate conversion to aromatase prevents its conversion to estrogen. It was found that mesterolone did not change the number of sperm or the amounts of FSH or LH. Research on mesterolone as a treatment for depression is continuing. Google's most popular searches for the following keywords: mesterolone dose, mesterolone advantages Comparing Mesterolone and Testosterone, Bodybuilding with meserol, Therapy with Mesterolone, Androgen replacement Mesterolone, The safety profile of Mesterolone, Possible side effects of Mesterolone. Other products in the market: Other androgenic substances including Anavar, Dianabol, and Testosterone Enanthate are available on the same market as mesterolone. Each of these substances has distinct qualities and uses, and they are often employed in medicinal and bodybuilding situations. Benefits for Your Health: Mesterolone is widely recognized for its capacity to augment libido, strengthen and increase muscle mass, and increase overall vitality. It is also used to treat low levels of androgen, infertility in men, and as part of hormone replacement therapy. Possible Consequences: The effects of this chemical on adipose tissue distribution, bone density, and muscular growth are substantial. Additionally, it is well-known for the psychological impacts it has, such as the boosting of mood and the augmentation of cognitive performance. Explanation of Product Mechanism: Mesterolone mimics testosterone. It increases anabolic processes like protein synthesis, which results in the development of muscle and strength, by binding to androgen receptors in a variety of tissues. Ensuring safety: While usually regarded safe when taken under medical supervision, it is critical to follow recommended doses in order to limit hazards. Possible Adverse Reactions: Typical adverse effects consist of acne, increased hair growth, fluctuations in mood, and alterations in libido. It can also change the way your liver works and your blood balance, so you need to be checked on often. Information on dosing: Mesterolone dose is conditional on both the drug's intended purpose and the patient's unique health status. When looking for tailored dose suggestions, it is absolutely necessary to talk with a healthcare practitioner. Important information: Patients with prostate cancer, liver tumors, hypercalcemia, or cardiovascular disease should not use mesterolone. In summary: There are several advantages to testosterone, especially when it comes to developing muscle and using hormone replacement treatment. However, it should be used with cautiously, bearing in mind the possible adverse effects and the significance of medical supervision. \"Frequently Asked Questions\" Section: Q: Is Mesterolone effective for muscle building? A: Yes, because it is an anabolic substance, mesterolone can be used to build muscle. Use it properly and with a doctor's supervision to get the most out of it and avoid any negative side effects. Q: Can Mesterolone be used safely over a long period of time? A: Due to the possible hazards to the liver and cardiovascular system, the use of mesterolone for an extended period of time needs close monitoring. Continuous evaluation requires medical consultation. Q: Can Mesterolone have an impact on fertility? A: Methylolone may affect sperm production, which might affect fertility in some people. Its consequences on fertility are complicated, and they should be thoroughly discussed with a healthcare practitioner. Q: Are there any alternative options to Mesterolone that occur naturally? A: Although fenugreek and tribulus terrestris are frequently recommended as substitutes, their effectiveness falls short when compared to that of meterolone. Carefully consider all of your options and get advice from medical experts if you need it.

Ces substances peuvent provenir de diverses sources telles que les plantes, les herbes et les animaux. Parmi les exemples courants d'aphrodisiaques naturels, citons le ginseng, la racine de maca, les huîtres, le chocolat et le miel. Beaucoup de ces aphrodisiaques sont considérés comme sûrs, mais il est important de noter que leur efficacité peut varier d'une personne à l'autre. Certains peuvent également avoir des effets secondaires potentiels et des interactions avec des médicaments, il est donc important de procéder avec prudence avant d'utiliser tout aphrodisiaque naturel.

Eigenlijk zijn Research chemicals chemisch van aard die voornamelijk door wetenschappers worden gebruikt voor het uitvoeren van verschillende onderzoeken in laboratoria. De chemische stoffen worden alleen voor laboratoriumgebruik gebruikt. Er is een grote behoefte aan. Onthoud voor laboratoriumonderzoek doeleinden alleen en niet te gebruiken voor andere doeleinden.

Een kenmerk van een onderzoekschemische stof is dat het alleen voor laboratoriumonderzoek is bedoeld; een onderzoekschemische stof is niet bedoeld voor gebruik door mensen of dieren.”"

What Are SARMS? - We Have SARMS For Sale A Selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) is a type of drug that is designed to selectively bind to androgen receptors in specific tissues, such as muscle and bone. This means that SARMs can have anabolic effects (building muscle) without the same androgenic effects (masculinizing effects) as testosterone. SARMs were first developed in the early 1990s after Dalton and Miller, who discovered that aryl propionamides with structural similarities to bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide could activate AR-dependent transcriptional activity provided the early lead for the development of diaryl propionamide class of SARMs. However, SARMs are not currently approved for use in humans, and there is a limited amount of research on their safety and efficacy. The potential benefits of SARMs include their anabolic effects without the same androgenic effects as testosterone. This could make them useful for treating conditions such as muscle wasting and osteoporosis. However, the potential risks of SARMs include liver toxicity, cardiovascular disease, and prostate cancer. Different Types of SARMS The majority of SARMs found in the market can typically be encountered in three distinct variations: Powder SARMS: Initially, all SARMs exist as a powdered substance, which is then transformed into either tablet, encased within capsules, or converted into a liquid form. Every SARM initially starts in a powder state. This is the reason many researchers regard powdered SARMs as the most unadulterated version of these medicinal compounds. Powdered SARMs can be effortlessly portioned into the specific quantity needed by the investigator. Gel SARMS: GEL SARMs enjoy considerable popularity as well. They are also referred to as SARMs Capsules.  The enthusiasm primarily stems from the convenience of not needing to measure out capsules, thus making the process more straightforward for researchers. GEL SARMs maintain their initial purity for extended durations. GEL also safeguards the strength of the encapsulated ingredients. This guarantees the uniformity and effectiveness of each individual dose. Active components in liquids have been observed to diminish in potency over time. Liquid SARMS: Liquid SARMs are recognized for their exceptional purity and extended half-life. When appropriately stored, they possess a lengthy shelf life and can be effortlessly measured and preserved. Liquid SARMs hold a distinctive appeal for researchers due to the ease of measuring precise quantities for administration to subjects, with or without water. They demonstrate potential in their respective research fields for those who find it challenging to utilize capsules or pills, particularly when working with animals. Umbrella Labs — Research-Grade Nootropics, Peptides & SARMs (RUO Only) Umbrella Labs is a research chemicals company supplying nootropics, peptides, and SARMs exclusively for laboratory research purposes only. We provide independent purity verification, COAs, and quality control data to support reproducible science. None of our products are intended for human consumption. What is a Certificate of Analysis (COA)? A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a document produced by an independent or in-house analytical laboratory verifying a compound’s identity, purity, and concentration using methods like HPLC, LC-MS, or NMR. What is High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)? HPLC is a laboratory technique that separates components in a mixture by passing solvent under high pressure through a column to quantify purity or detect contaminants. What is Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)? LC-MS combines liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry to separate, identify, and quantify molecular species by mass-to-charge ratio. What does ≥ 99% purity mean? ≥ 99% purity indicates that 99 percent or more of a sample is the target analyte; impurities (≤1%) are the detectable residual substances. What does “Research Use Only” (RUO) mean? Research Use Only (RUO) means the compound is explicitly for laboratory, analytical, or experimental use—not for medical, diagnostic, or human consumption. Focus on Nootropics – Why They Matter in Research Nootropics (also known as “cognitive enhancers”) are molecules studied for their effects on brain function, memory, focus, and neuroprotection.
