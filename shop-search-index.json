Shop Now Learn More Featured Products Our SARMs & Peptides GAINING SARMs Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are products that are used to promote muscle growth . SARMs are tools to make your workout more effective OUR ANABOLIC BLENDS The blend of most powerful cutting and bulking anabolics formulated to BURN all the fat and water for getting massive and ripped muscles at most efficiently. GROWTH FACTORS/PEPTIDES Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) are a class of peptides that have piqued the interest of bodybuilders due to their ability to increase the synthesis and release of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. It can aid in muscle building and stimulate fat reduction. It accomplishes this by inducing the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1, in turn, stimulates muscle protein synthesis and growth. It also appears to indirectly enhance body fat's breakdown. Reviews for buying products & contact with us Better yet, see us in person!

Here at Underdoglabs™, all of our products are manufactured only in GMP-certified facilities and are Pharmaceutical grade. GMP refers to the Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administrations under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. underdoglabs™ Lifescience goes one step further by using advanced analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, to ensure our products meet label claims for potency and purity. Underdoglabs™ tests its products using US Pharmacopeia and other exacting pharmaceutical assay standards. Finally, a Certificate of Analysis (COA) guaranteeing every one of our products’ quality, potency, and purity is kept on file and available. For more information please download the COA on every product page. We believe the quality of our products is finest, hereby we fully stand by our products & offer full refund as our guarantee program. What does Underdoglabs™ do to ensure the quality of its products? FDA registered, USA based analytical testing laboratories are used for all of our product testing. Each batch is first tested by manufacturer & double tested by us in laboratory and COA (certificate of analysis) is released on the basis of lab tests. Only after our Director of Quality Control determines the materials are compliant and per specifications, are they inventoried and made available for production. Some of our key laboratory procedures and objectives are: • Advanced analytical methods for testing the quality and efficacy of products. • Documentation of Certificate of Analysis for every product. • Procedures that follow industry-standard methodologies such as ASTM, ISO, as well as US, European, and Japanese Pharmacopoeia. • 3rd Party laboratory testing. The bottom line is we are fully commited to assuring our customers receive only the finest and purest ingredients. What's the difference between tablets, capsules and Powder? Material inside the capsules are exactly as same as powder form with same potency. It is better to intake in powdered form if one is taking more than one supplement. Powdered form have more bioavailability and better absorbed by body. If you want a capsule form, a person can buy empty gelatin capsules and fill the powder himself and save big bucks.

Read more How to Increase Energy Production with Age | AgelessRx Skip to content Search for: Here’s what we’ll cover in this blog post: The connection between energy and aging Why mitochondria are your body’s secret powerhouses How ATP keeps you feeling young and vibrant Easy tips to keep your energy levels high as you age Ever feel like aging is slowly draining your energy? What if you could hang onto that same energy you felt when you were twenty and increase energy production as you age? According to the energy maintenance theory of aging , it’s possible! The key lies in keeping your cells energized, as those who age best have cells that excel at maintaining energy production over time. The driving force behind this energy? Your mitochondria—the powerhouses of our cells . These tiny engines produce ATP—the fuel your body needs to repair, grow, and keep your muscles and brain in top shape. As we age, our mitochondria slow down. Less ATP means less energy, and soon our bodies feel like they’re running on a low battery. This can show up as weaker muscles, brain fog, and a higher chance of illness. The good news? If we keep our mitochondria healthy, we can stay sharp, strong, and energized for years to come. But what exactly happens to our mitochondria as we age, and how does it impact the aging process? Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Aging Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging . As we age, our mitochondria weaken, unlike the pristine powerhouses you’d find in a toddler’s cells. Damaged mitochondria struggle to produce enough energy, leading to fatigue and other signs of aging. When our cells can’t produce the energy they need, everything slows down—immune function, metabolism, and even brain performance. However, improving mitochondrial efficiency can not only help our bodies keep up with life’s demands, but it may even slow down the aging process. Feeling Fatigued? It Might Be a Bigger Deal Everyone gets tired, but chronic fatigue could signal a bigger issue. Fatigue can be an early warning sign of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or even cancer. What’s going on behind the scenes? It might be a lack of cellular energy with declining ATP production that’s driving that ongoing tiredness. By improving mitochondrial health and working to boost ATP production, you can give your body the energy it needs to fight fatigue and stay resilient against disease as you age. Whether with supplements or lifestyle changes, supporting ATP synthesis can help you feel more energy and even slow down the effects of aging. How Can You Boost Mitochondrial Health? With easy lifestyle changes, you can boost your mitochondrial health and increase energy production: Exercise Regularly : Physical activity generates new mitochondria and strengthens the existing ones. Keep moving with activities like walking, yoga, or weight training. Eat a Balanced Diet : Fuel your cells with antioxidant-rich foods like leafy greens, fish, and nuts. These nutrients support mitochondria and overall health while giving us more energy. Manage Stress : Chronic stress can damage mitochondria. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to keep stress levels in check. Consider Select Treatments and Supplements : NAD+ , B12 , Coenzyme Q10, magnesium, or alpha-lipoic acid can all be beneficial in supporting energy production and mitochondrial health. Recharge Your Batteries with Expert Help Optimizing your energy levels as you age doesn’t have to be a solo mission. Sometimes, we all need a little assistance—especially when it comes to something as important as your long-term health. A longevity specialist (like our team at AgelessRx) can help tailor a plan with the right balance of diet, exercise, and supplements. If you’re looking to increase your mitochondrial health and optimize your energy for years to come, try scheduling a longevity consultation with an AgelessRx prescriber. You can also explore our expert-curated energy and fatigue treatments, like NAD+ or B12 injections, both of which have been shown to potentially help improve energy  for more healthy, life-filled years.

LDN 0.5 vs 1.5: What to Know Before You Buy | AgelessRx Skip to content Search for: Quick overview of what we’ll cover in this blog post: What to know before you buy LDN Why AgelessRx offers 2 starting doses The difference between 0.5mg & 1.5mg Who should start at which dose What to do if you want a different dose What to Know Before You Buy LDN Naltrexone is an enigmatic treatment whose benefits vary depending on which dosage you’re receiving. Just by the name alone, we can tell that Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is on the lower end of this spectrum, and its ideal use strays significantly from higher doses – namely, in how it affects our longevity. But the name shouldn’t suggest that there’s a single dose of LDN that’s considered the low dose. In fact, anything under 10mg of Naltrexone can be considered LDN. This begs the question: just how low do the doses go, and which dose is right for me? These questions are what drove us at AgelessRx to offer multiple starting doses for LDN. Below, we discuss the differences between these starting doses (0.5mg and 1.5mg), so you can make the most informed decision with your prescriber about what might be best for you. Here’s what to know before you buy LDN. Why the Low Dose? Many medications have different effects (and therefore different uses) when prescribed at higher or lower doses, and LDN is no exception. Naltrexone is most often prescribed to treat certain addictions at doses ranging from 50-150mg. When prescribed at these doses, Naltrexone acts as an antagonist to temporarily block the effects of certain drugs and naturally occurring dopamine, as well as the release of dopamine (the reward signal associated with drug addiction). When used at lower doses, though, Naltrexone appears to have a paradoxical effect that allows the brain to produce more endorphins, which help to improve pain relief. Additionally, lower doses of Naltrexone may also prevent overactivation of immune cells in the body and the brain (known as T-cells and microglia respectively), thereby blunting the destructive consequences of chronic inflammation. For these benefits, Naltrexone is prescribed at 9mg/day or under. The most common dose is usually 4.5mg/day, at which most users experience the greatest benefits with th"

Because it is inactivated by 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in skeleta musculos, it is considered a weak androgen. Its lack of substrate conversion to aromatase prevents its conversion to estrogen. It was found that mesterolone did not change the number of sperm or the amounts of FSH or LH. Research on mesterolone as a treatment for depression is continuing. Google's most popular searches for the following keywords: mesterolone dose, mesterolone advantages Comparing Mesterolone and Testosterone, Bodybuilding with meserol, Therapy with Mesterolone, Androgen replacement Mesterolone, The safety profile of Mesterolone, Possible side effects of Mesterolone. Other products in the market: Other androgenic substances including Anavar, Dianabol, and Testosterone Enanthate are available on the same market as mesterolone. Each of these substances has distinct qualities and uses, and they are often employed in medicinal and bodybuilding situations. Benefits for Your Health: Mesterolone is widely recognized for its capacity to augment libido, strengthen and increase muscle mass, and increase overall vitality. It is also used to treat low levels of androgen, infertility in men, and as part of hormone replacement therapy. Possible Consequences: The effects of this chemical on adipose tissue distribution, bone density, and muscular growth are substantial. Additionally, it is well-known for the psychological impacts it has, such as the boosting of mood and the augmentation of cognitive performance. Explanation of Product Mechanism: Mesterolone mimics testosterone. It increases anabolic processes like protein synthesis, which results in the development of muscle and strength, by binding to androgen receptors in a variety of tissues. Ensuring safety: While usually regarded safe when taken under medical supervision, it is critical to follow recommended doses in order to limit hazards. Possible Adverse Reactions: Typical adverse effects consist of acne, increased hair growth, fluctuations in mood, and alterations in libido. It can also change the way your liver works and your blood balance, so you need to be checked on often. Information on dosing: Mesterolone dose is conditional on both the drug's intended purpose and the patient's unique health status. When looking for tailored dose suggestions, it is absolutely necessary to talk with a healthcare practitioner. Important information: Patients with prostate cancer, liver tumors, hypercalcemia, or cardiovascular disease should not use mesterolone. In summary: There are several advantages to testosterone, especially when it comes to developing muscle and using hormone replacement treatment. However, it should be used with cautiously, bearing in mind the possible adverse effects and the significance of medical supervision. \"Frequently Asked Questions\" Section: Q: Is Mesterolone effective for muscle building? A: Yes, because it is an anabolic substance, mesterolone can be used to build muscle. Use it properly and with a doctor's supervision to get the most out of it and avoid any negative side effects. Q: Can Mesterolone be used safely over a long period of time? A: Due to the possible hazards to the liver and cardiovascular system, the use of mesterolone for an extended period of time needs close monitoring. Continuous evaluation requires medical consultation. Q: Can Mesterolone have an impact on fertility? A: Methylolone may affect sperm production, which might affect fertility in some people. Its consequences on fertility are complicated, and they should be thoroughly discussed with a healthcare practitioner. Q: Are there any alternative options to Mesterolone that occur naturally? A: Although fenugreek and tribulus terrestris are frequently recommended as substitutes, their effectiveness falls short when compared to that of meterolone. Carefully consider all of your options and get advice from medical experts if you need it.

By harnessing new-generation mass spectrometry analysis, we can augment our purity assessments by enhancing sensitivity and adding a new dimension of measurement. Without question, our LC/MS-MS approach offers better quality assurance and control than conventional HPLC-UV alone. This is especially crucial for analysis of SARMs, many of which exist as diastereomeric mixtures. Quantitative resolution of these mixtures demands highly sensitive instrumentation, such as our triple-quadrupole spectrometer. Method development, data acquisition/processing and report generation are performed using fully-licensed, comprehensive chromatography system software in order to comply with regulatory data integrity requirements. Our proprietary processes ensures that Umbrella offers only the very best SARMS for sale and peptides for sale on the market today.

What Are SARMS? - We Have SARMS For Sale A Selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) is a type of drug that is designed to selectively bind to androgen receptors in specific tissues, such as muscle and bone. This means that SARMs can have anabolic effects (building muscle) without the same androgenic effects (masculinizing effects) as testosterone. SARMs were first developed in the early 1990s after Dalton and Miller, who discovered that aryl propionamides with structural similarities to bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide could activate AR-dependent transcriptional activity provided the early lead for the development of diaryl propionamide class of SARMs. However, SARMs are not currently approved for use in humans, and there is a limited amount of research on their safety and efficacy. The potential benefits of SARMs include their anabolic effects without the same androgenic effects as testosterone. This could make them useful for treating conditions such as muscle wasting and osteoporosis. However, the potential risks of SARMs include liver toxicity, cardiovascular disease, and prostate cancer. Different Types of SARMS The majority of SARMs found in the market can typically be encountered in three distinct variations: Powder SARMS: Initially, all SARMs exist as a powdered substance, which is then transformed into either tablet, encased within capsules, or converted into a liquid form. Every SARM initially starts in a powder state. This is the reason many researchers regard powdered SARMs as the most unadulterated version of these medicinal compounds. Powdered SARMs can be effortlessly portioned into the specific quantity needed by the investigator. Gel SARMS: GEL SARMs enjoy considerable popularity as well. They are also referred to as SARMs Capsules.  The enthusiasm primarily stems from the convenience of not needing to measure out capsules, thus making the process more straightforward for researchers. GEL SARMs maintain their initial purity for extended durations. GEL also safeguards the strength of the encapsulated ingredients. This guarantees the uniformity and effectiveness of each individual dose. Active components in liquids have been observed to diminish in potency over time. Liquid SARMS: Liquid SARMs are recognized for their exceptional purity and extended half-life. When appropriately stored, they possess a lengthy shelf life and can be effortlessly measured and preserved. Liquid SARMs hold a distinctive appeal for researchers due to the ease of measuring precise quantities for administration to subjects, with or without water. They demonstrate potential in their respective research fields for those who find it challenging to utilize capsules or pills, particularly when working with animals. Umbrella Labs — Research-Grade Nootropics, Peptides & SARMs (RUO Only) Umbrella Labs is a research chemicals company supplying nootropics, peptides, and SARMs exclusively for laboratory research purposes only. We provide independent purity verification, COAs, and quality control data to support reproducible science. None of our products are intended for human consumption. What is a Certificate of Analysis (COA)? A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a document produced by an independent or in-house analytical laboratory verifying a compound’s identity, purity, and concentration using methods like HPLC, LC-MS, or NMR. What is High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)? HPLC is a laboratory technique that separates components in a mixture by passing solvent under high pressure through a column to quantify purity or detect contaminants. What is Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)? LC-MS combines liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry to separate, identify, and quantify molecular species by mass-to-charge ratio. What does ≥ 99% purity mean? ≥ 99% purity indicates that 99 percent or more of a sample is the target analyte; impurities (≤1%) are the detectable residual substances. What does “Research Use Only” (RUO) mean? Research Use Only (RUO) means the compound is explicitly for laboratory, analytical, or experimental use—not for medical, diagnostic, or human consumption. Focus on Nootropics – Why They Matter in Research Nootropics (also known as “cognitive enhancers”) are molecules studied for their effects on brain function, memory, focus, and neuroprotection. At Umbrella Labs, we emphasize nootropic compounds—each batch is accompanied by third-party purity data and clear labeling so researchers can compare results with confidence. You can link to a “shop category / nootropics” page internally if that exists.
