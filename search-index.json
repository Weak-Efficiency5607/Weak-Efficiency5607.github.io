    "content": "1P-LSD Also known as 1-propanoyl-lysergic acid diethylamide (1-propionyl-LSD). Psychoactive substance related to LSD. Thought to work by turning into LSD in the body, leading to similar effects. 1P-LSD is quickly changed into LSD after you take it, whether by mouth or injection. Studies show it’s almost fully converted, with LSD detectable in blood and urine soon after. 1P-LSD’s effects are mainly due to LSD. Mainly affects serotonin receptors, especially the 5-HT2A type, which is key for the mind-altering effects like hallucinations and altered perception. Interacts with other serotonin and dopamine receptors, but these are less understood for 1P-LSD specifically. Can boost brain plasticity, potentially helping with memory and neural growth, similar to LSD. It seems likely that 1P-LSD is not addictive, with no signs of compulsive use or withdrawal. Tolerance builds quickly, meaning repeated use within a short time reduces its effects, resetting after a few days without use. Theoretical risk of heart issues due to effects on 5-HT2B receptors. Effects last around 7–12 hours, similar to LSD. Blood half-life of about 6.4 hours for 1P-LSD. Almost fully absorbed when taken by mouth, and LSD can be detected in urine for up to 80 hours. A study published in Drug Testing and Analysis in 2020  found that after oral or intravenous administration of 100 μg 1P-LSD hemitartrate (equivalent to 71.2 μg LSD base), 1P-LSD was detectable in serum for up to 4.16 hours, after which it was completely converted to LSD. This conversion was confirmed by detecting LSD in all serum samples, with the last sampling after approximately 24 hours, and in urine for up to 80 hours. The bioavailability of LSD after oral ingestion of 1P-LSD was close to 100%, indicating efficient conversion. LSD (and thus 1P-LSD) binds with high affinity to most serotonin receptors except 5-HT3 and 5-HT4, affecting 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT6 at recreational doses. Specific affinity values include: 5-HT1A: 0.64 – 7.3 nM 5-HT2A: 0.47 – 21 nM 5-HT2B: 0.98 – 30 nM 5-HT2C: 1.1 – 48 nM It also shows significant affinity for dopamine receptors, with Ki values such as D1: 155–340 nM and D2: 61–126 nM, though these are lower than for serotonin receptors. The conversion of 1P-LSD to LSD leads to increased glutamate release in the cerebral cortex, specifically in layer V, enhancing excitation. 1P-LSD, like LSD, exhibits significant tachyphylaxis, with tolerance developing almost immediately after ingestion, as noted in PsychonautWiki. Tolerance is reduced to half after 5–7 days and returns to baseline after 14 days without further consumption. There is cross-tolerance with other psychedelics, such as mescaline and psilocybin. While 1P-LSD itself shows 38% the potency of LSD in mice, as per PsychonautWiki, its effects are primarily due to conversion to LSD. The elimination half-life for 1P-LSD is approximately 6.4 hours, while for LSD, it is about 5.7 hours, as per the PubMed entry. 1P-LSD is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 enzymes, with the major metabolite being LSD. Given its prodrug nature, 1P-LSD’s pharmacological actions mirror those of LSD, with differences primarily in pharmacokinetics, such as rate of absorption and duration. Table: Summary of Pharmacological Actions Aspect Details for 1P-LSD (via LSD Conversion) Primary Mechanism Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, psychedelic effects mediated by this. Receptor Affinity High affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C; moderate for dopamine. Neurotransmitter Effects Increases glutamate release, enhances D2–5-HT2A signaling. Psychoplastogenic Effects Promotes neural plasticity, binds to TrkB receptor. Tolerance Rapid tolerance, resets after 3–4 days; cross-tolerance with psychedelics. Addiction Liability Non-addictive, no withdrawal, low abuse potential. Potency Effects at low doses (via LSD), 200x psilocybin, 5,000x mescaline potency. Duration 7–12 hours, onset 0.4–1.0 hours. Metabolism Converted to LSD, liver metabolism by CYP450, 13% urine elimination in 24h. Potential Risks Theoretical cardiac risk due to 5-HT2B agonism, needs more research. Condition Bioavailability Onset of Effects Duration Notes Empty Stomach Likely close to 100% Faster, more intense Potentially shorter Based on user reports and inferred from light meal study. Light Meal (Study) Close to 100% (92-100%) Not specified, likely slow Not specified Grumann et al. (2020), experiments started 2 hours after light breakfast. Full Stomach Possibly high, data limited Slower, less intense Potentially longer Inferred from LSD studies and user reports, no direct data for 1P-LSD."

    "title": "3-MMA (Metaphedrine)",
    "url": "wiki/alone-3-mma.html",
    "content": "3-MMA (Metaphedrine) Other name: 3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine. 3-MMA is an amphetamine derivative, structurally related to methamphetamine but with a methyl group at the 3-position on the phenyl ring and an N-methyl group. As an amphetamine derivative, it is expected to act as a monoamine releasing agent, increasing the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and possibly serotonin by interacting with their respective transporters (SERT, NET, DAT). Monoamine Release: Research on related compounds, such as 3-Methoxyamphetamine (3-MA), shows EC50 values of 58.0 nM for norepinephrine and 103 nM for dopamine in rat brain synaptosomes ( source ). While 3-MMA is structurally different, it likely shares similar properties, but no specific data exist. MAO Inhibition: User discussions on platforms like Bluelight suggest 3-MMA may act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), potentially stronger than amphetamine (affinity 11 µM) but weaker than para-substituted amphetamines like pMTA or pMA (nanomolar range). For comparison, 3-MeOA (a related compound) has an affinity of 23 µM, indicating 3-MMA might be safer than 4-MeOA (pMA, sub-micromolar affinity) ( source ). However, these are speculations without scientific validation. Receptor Binding: No studies on 3-MMA's receptor binding (e.g., to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, or adrenergic receptors) were found. Related compounds like 3-Methylmethcathinone (3-MMC) show binding to serotonin and adrenergic receptors, but 3-MMA's profile remains unknown ( source ). There is no detailed pharmacokinetic data for 3-MMA, such as oral bioavailability, half-life, or Tmax. For comparison, related compounds like 3-MMC have an oral bioavailability of 7% and a half-life of 50 minutes ( source ), but these cannot be directly applied to 3-MMA due to structural differences. Onset and Duration: Oral administration reportedly has an onset around 90 minutes, with peak effects at 2.5 hours and a soft comedown after 4.5 hours. Higher doses (e.g., 50% filled 00 capsule) show quicker serotonin effects, with a total duration of 4.5 hours ( source ). Administration Routes: Insufflation (snorting) causes a burning sensation, with effects noted without a harsh comedown, but exact durations are unclear. Given the lack of studies, 3-MMA's safety profile is uncertain. User reports highlight potential risks: Vasoconstriction and Tachycardia: Noted at higher doses, with vein pain reported, suggesting cardiovascular effects similar to other stimulants. Neurotoxicity: There is concern about neurotoxicity, especially at high doses, due to MDMA-like serotonin flood stages, but no scientific evidence confirms this. Comparison to Related Compounds: Studies on 4-Methylmethamphetamine (4-MMA) suggest minimal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice compared to methamphetamine , but human data for 3-MMA are lacking. User reports provide approximate dosing, though without precise measurements: Insufflation: ~2 cm line (~0.8 inches), burning sensation, no harsh comedown. Oral: 00 capsule 25% filled, peak at 2.5 hours, soft comedown after 4.5 hours; higher dose (50% filled) shows quicker serotonin effects. Effects include clean stimulation, mild tachycardia, blurry vision (similar to high MDMA doses), weaker empathogenic effects, mood lift, and dry mouth, with increased water intake needed. The risk of redosing is noted due to delayed onset, which could exacerbate side effects. 3-MMA is a positional isomer of schedule I controlled substances in the US (e.g., EtAMP, dimethyl-AMP), making it \"born illegal\" with unambiguous legal risks ( source ). Its status as a designer drug underscores the need for caution, given the lack of regulation and research. To provide context, tables below summarize data for related compounds, though not directly applicable to 3-MMA: Compound EC50 Norepinephrine (nM) EC50 Dopamine (nM) Notes 3-Methoxyamphetamine 58.0 103 Combined SNDRA, no serotonin EC50 reported 4-Methylmethamphetamine 22.2 44.1 Well-balanced SNDRA, minimal neurotoxicity Compound MAO Inhibition Affinity (µM) Notes Amphetamine 3-MeOA pMA (4-MeOA) 11 23 Sub-micromolar Baseline comparison ( source ) Less potent than amphetamine Stronger MAOI, higher risk"

    "title": "5-MeO-DALT HCI",
    "url": "wiki/alone-5-meo-dalt.html",
    "content": "5-MeO-DALT HCI Serotonin Receptor Agonism (5-HT Receptors): Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, which is primarily responsible for its psychedelic effects. It also binds to other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT6, with Ki values (binding affinities) lower than 10 μM. The 5-HT2A receptor is critical for hallucinogenic effects, while 5-HT1A binding may modulate emotional and sensory effects. Effects: Produces altered perceptions, euphoria, visual hallucinations (primarily closed-eye visuals), increased sensory awareness, and emotional amplification. The head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents, a behavioral proxy for psychedelic effects, is positively correlated with 5-HT2A receptor affinity and negatively correlated with 5-HT1A affinity. Timeline: Onset: <15 minutes (oral administration). Peak: ~30 minutes post-administration. Duration: 2–4 hours (oral route, based on Shulgin’s reports). Notes: The psychedelic effects are described as primarily physical (e.g., tingling sensations, body high) with fewer visual distortions compared to other psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin. Monoamine Reuptake Inhibition: Mechanism: 5-MeO-DALT inhibits the reuptake of dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT), increasing extracellular levels of these neurotransmitters. This contributes to its euphoric and energizing effects. Effects: Enhanced mood, increased energy, and heightened arousal. User reports describe a “sensual” and “energized” body state. Physiological Effects: Mechanism: Likely mediated by a combination of serotonin receptor activation and monoamine reuptake inhibition, with possible contributions from adrenergic and histamine receptor binding. Effects: Body High: Described as a sharp, all-encompassing tingling sensation that rises during the onset and peaks at ~30 minutes. Cardiovascular Effects: Potential for tachycardia and increased blood pressure, as reported with other synthetic tryptamines. Other Effects: Agitation, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control (making walking difficult) have been reported, particularly at higher doses. Adverse Effects: Acute delirium and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in rare cases, indicating potential for severe toxicity at high doses or in combination with other substances. Timeline: Onset within 15 minutes, peaking at 30 minutes, and resolving within 2–4 hours for most effects. Severe adverse effects (e.g., delirium) may persist longer in overdose scenarios. Pharmacokinetics Half-Life: Data Availability: There is no direct data on the half-life of 5-MeO-DALT in humans. Based on its short duration of action (2–4 hours), the elimination half-life is likely on the order of 1–2 hours, similar to other short-acting tryptamines like 5-MeO-DMT (half-life ~1 hour) ( source ). Metabolism: 5-MeO-DALT is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) through 6-hydroxylation, O-demethylation, or N-dealkylation, with metabolites conjugated to glucuronide or sulfate. (source 1 and 2 ) Estimation: Assuming similar pharmacokinetics to 5-MeO-DMT, the half-life is likely short, with rapid clearance contributing to the brief duration of effects. Bioavailability: Oral Bioavailability: Not explicitly quantified in the literature, but oral administration is effective, suggesting moderate bioavailability. Anecdotal reports indicate that oral doses of 12–25 mg produce effects, while higher oral doses (30–35 mg) of 5-MeO-DMT have low potency due to first-pass metabolism by MAO-A, suggesting 5-MeO-DALT may have better oral bioavailability due to less MAO-A susceptibility. A rough estimate based on related tryptamines (e.g., mitragynine ~21%) suggests oral bioavailability of 20–40%. (source 1 and 2 ) Other Routes: Insufflation (Snorting): Likely higher bioavailability (50–70% estimated, based on 5-MeO-DMT’s intranasal bioavailability), with faster onset (~5–10 minutes). ( source ) Intravenous: Near 100% bioavailability, but no specific data exists for 5-MeO-DALT. Rectal: Potentially higher than oral (40–60% estimated), with faster onset than oral but slower than insufflation. Vaporization/Inhalation: High bioavailability (70–90% estimated), with very rapid onset (within minutes). ( source ) Dosage Information Safe Dosage Range: Minimum Effective Dose: 12 mg (oral), based on Shulgin’s reports and anecdotal data. Lower doses (e.g., 4–10 mg) may produce mild effects but are often subthreshold. ( source ) Typical Recreational Dose: 12–25 mg (oral), producing moderate psychedelic effects with manageable intensity. ( source ) Upper Safe Limit: Up to 25 mg (oral) is generally considered within the safe range for most users, though individual sensitivity varies. Doses up to 50 mg have been reported anecdotally but are associated with increased risk of adverse effects (e.g., agitation, loss of motor control). ( source ) Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Threshold for Increased Risk: Doses above 25 mg (oral) increase the risk of adverse effects such as agitation, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and loss of limb control. Doses approaching 50 mg are considered high-risk due to potential for delirium and rhabdomyolysis. ( source 1 and source 2 ) Context: A reported death involved a user under the influence of 5-MeO-DALT who was hit by a vehicle, suggesting impaired judgment and motor control at higher doses. ( source 1 and source 2 ) LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%): Data Availability: No specific LD50 values are available for 5-MeO-DALT in humans or animals. For comparison, 5-MeO-DMT has an LD50 in mice ranging from 48–278 mg/kg depending on the route of administration. Assuming similar toxicity, the human LD50 for 5-MeO-DALT (for a 70 kg individual) could be estimated at 3,360–19,460 mg (3.36–19.46 g), but this is highly speculative and not directly applicable. ( source ) Dangerous Dose Estimation: Doses above 50 mg (oral) are likely dangerous due to increased risk of severe agitation, hyperthermia, delirium, and rhabdomyolysis. A fatal outcome is more likely from behavioral risks (e.g., accidents due to impaired judgment) than direct pharmacological toxicity, as seen in the reported death case. ( source 1 and source 2 ) When It Becomes Too Dangerous: Threshold: Doses ≥50 mg (oral) or equivalent via other routes (e.g., 20–30 mg insufflated) are considered dangerous due to heightened risk of severe physiological and psychological effects. Combining 5-MeO-DALT with MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., harmaline) significantly increases the risk of serotonin toxicity, even at lower doses, due to potentiation of serotonergic effects. ( source 1 and source 2 ) Signs of Danger: Agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, delirium, and loss of motor control indicate overdose. Immediate medical attention is required if these occur. ( source ) Additional Notes Limited Data: The pharmacological profile of 5-MeO-DALT is poorly characterized due to limited human studies and sparse toxicology data. Most information comes from anecdotal reports and rodent studies, which may not fully translate to humans. ( source 1 and source 2 ) Harm Reduction: Due to the lack of comprehensive safety data, users should start with low doses (e.g., 10–12 mg oral), avoid combinations with other psychoactive substances (especially MAOIs), and ensure a safe environment. Standard drug tests (e.g., urine EIA) do not detect 5-MeO-DALT, complicating clinical management of toxicity. ( source ) Summary Table Parameter Value Minimum Effective Dose 12 mg (oral) Safe Dosage Range 12–25 mg (oral) Maximum Safe Dose ~25 mg (oral) Dangerous Dose ≥50 mg (oral) or equivalent (e.g., 20–30 mg insufflated) LD50 Unknown; estimated 3.36–19.46 g (speculative, based on 5-MeO-DMT) Half-Life ~1–2 hours (estimated) Oral Bioavailability ~20–40% (estimated) Insufflation Bioavailability ~50–70% (estimated) Onset (Oral) <15 minutes Peak (Oral) ~30 minutes Duration (Oral) 2–4 hours"

    "title": "Agomelatine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-agomelatine.html",
    "content": "Agomelatine Pharmacological Actions Agomelatine's mechanism of action involves dual receptor interactions, which are critical to its therapeutic effects. It acts as a potent agonist at melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2C receptors, with some affinity for 5-HT2B receptors, though the clinical relevance of the latter is less established. Melatonin MT1 Receptor Agonism: Agomelatine binds with high affinity to MT1 receptors, with a Ki value of approximately 0.1 nM. This agonism is believed to regulate circadian rhythms, promoting sleep onset and improving sleep quality, particularly by attenuating alerting signals to the cortex. Melatonin MT2 Receptor Agonism: Similarly, it has a Ki of about 0.12 nM for MT2 receptors, contributing to phase-shifting circadian rhythms, which is beneficial for patients with disrupted sleep-wake cycles. This action is thought to advance the timing of sleep and body temperature decline. Serotonin 5-HT2C Receptor Antagonism: With a Ki of approximately 631 nM, agomelatine acts as a neutral antagonist at 5-HT2C receptors, leading to increased release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the frontal cortex. This disinhibition is thought to enhance mood and cognitive function, a key aspect of its antidepressant effect. Serotonin 5-HT2B Receptor Antagonism: It also interacts with 5-HT2B receptors, with a Ki of about 660 nM, but the functional significance is less clear, with limited evidence on its contribution to therapeutic outcomes. These actions influence over time in a biphasic manner. Acute effects, particularly on sleep and circadian rhythms, are observed shortly after administration, often within hours to days, due to its rapid absorption and receptor interactions. For instance, studies have shown improvements in sleep onset and quality from the first week of treatment, likely due to MT1/MT2 agonism. Chronic effects, such as antidepressant efficacy, develop over weeks, with clinical trials indicating significant mood improvements after 6-8 weeks, mediated by the combined melatonergic and serotonergic effects. Pharmacokinetic Profile Agomelatine's pharmacokinetics are characterized by rapid absorption and metabolism, with significant implications for its clinical use: Half-life: The mean plasma half-life is between 1 and 2 hours, indicating rapid elimination, which aligns with its once-daily dosing at bedtime to mimic natural melatonin rhythms. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is less than 5% at therapeutic doses, attributed to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, with substantial interindividual variability. This low bioavailability is higher in women and increased by oral contraceptives, while smoking reduces it. Absorption and Distribution: It is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1 to 2 hours. The volume of distribution is about 35 L, and it is 95% bound to plasma proteins, with no significant changes in binding with age or renal impairment, though free fraction doubles in hepatic impairment. Metabolism and Excretion: Metabolized mainly via CYP1A2 (90%), with minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, producing inactive metabolites that are rapidly conjugated and excreted, primarily in urine (80%), with negligible unchanged drug. Dosage and Safety Considerations Standard Dosage: The recommended starting dose is 25 mg once daily at bedtime, taken orally with or without food. This dose is effective for many patients, as evidenced by clinical trials showing significant antidepressant effects at this level. Dose Adjustment: If there is no improvement after two weeks, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, based on individual benefit/risk assessment and strict liver function monitoring. Treatment duration should be at least 6 months to ensure symptom-free status. Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range is 25-50 mg daily, with 25 mg identified as the minimum effective dose from studies comparing doses of 1, 5, and 25 mg, where 25 mg showed the best effectiveness. Maximum Recommended Dose: 50 mg daily is the maximum recommended dose, with higher doses not advised due to increased risk of liver enzyme elevations. Overdose and Toxicity: In overdose cases, doses up to 7.5 g have been reported, primarily causing drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea in sole ingestions, with no severe toxicity. Polydrug overdoses showed more severe effects, but these were likely due to co-ingested substances. Liver transaminase rises, a known risk at therapeutic doses, were not reported in overdose scenarios, suggesting a wide safety margin. LD50: Specific LD50 values are not available in public sources, but animal studies and overdose data suggest it is likely high, given the lack of severe toxicity even at high doses in humans. When It Becomes Too Dangerous: Doses above 50 mg may increase the risk of adverse effects, particularly liver enzyme elevations, with monitoring recommended. The exact threshold for danger is unclear, but clinical guidelines contraindicate use in hepatic impairment and advise caution above recommended doses. Clinical Implications and Research Gaps Agomelatine's dual action offers benefits for both sleep and mood, with acute effects on sleep architecture observed in polysomnography studies, showing increased slow-wave sleep and improved efficiency. However, research gaps remain, particularly in precise functional EC50 values for MT1/MT2 agonism and long-term safety at higher doses. The controversy around its efficacy, as noted in some reviews, highlights the need for further studies, especially in diverse populations. In conclusion, agomelatine presents a novel therapeutic option with a favorable safety profile within recommended doses, but careful monitoring for liver function is essential. Its pharmacological actions and pharmacokinetic properties underpin its clinical utility, with ongoing research needed to fully elucidate its safety at higher doses and in special populations."

    "title": "Alanine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-alanine.html",
    "content": "Alanine Blood Sugar Regulation Essential amino acids for protein synthesis and energy Supports the immune system, though the exact mechanisms are not fully clear. Agonist at the NMDA-glycine site. Is a glucogenic amino acid, meaning it can be converted into glucose in the liver through gluconeogenesis. L-alanine is released from muscle tissues during protein breakdown and transported to the liver, where it undergoes transamination via alanine transaminase (ALT), producing pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted into glucose, contributing to blood glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia, especially in glucose-dependent tissues like the brain and red blood cells. Care must be taken, as it can be harmful if blood sugar is already normal or high, necessitating careful monitoring. It serves as an energy source for muscles and the central nervous system. It is often used in combination with other amino acids, such as in alanine-glutamine dipeptides, to enhance solubility and stability in nutritional solutions. An unexpected and less commonly discussed aspect is the pharmacological action of D-alanine, the enantiomer of L-alanine. D-alanine is a selective and potent agonist at the NMDA-glycine site, a receptor involved in excitatory neurotransmission. Research has shown it improves cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenia, particularly when used alongside antipsychotics, with a small randomized controlled trial (n=22) demonstrating benefits without significant side effects (Alanine). Alanine also has structural roles in proteins, with 31 residues in the I2S structure, and mutations at alanine sites can lead to disease phenotypes. For example, mutations like p.Ala68Glu, p.Ala85Ser, and p.Ala205Thr are associated with severe or attenuated phenotypes, depending on their location (mid-helix or buried positions) ( Studie ). Action Mechanism Clinical Relevance Gluconeogenesis Support Converted to glucose via ALT in liver, part of glucose-alanine cycle Manages hypoglycemia, supports fasting/exercise states Nutritional Support Provides amino acids for protein synthesis, energy source Used in total parenteral nutrition, critical illness care Immune System Support Contributes to immune function, often in dipeptides like alanine-glutamine Potential in reducing infections, improving patient outcomes NMDA Agonist (D-alanine) Agonist at NMDA-glycine site, improves cognition in schizophrenia Investigational for neurological disorders, not for depression Structural Role and Disease Mutations affect protein stability, linked to disease phenotypes Informative for genetic and therapeutic research"

    "title": "Amandatine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-amantadine.html",
    "content": "Amandatine It seems likely that Amantadine acts as a PDE1 inhibitor, which may increase cyclic AMP levels and contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Studies indicate Amantadine increases AADC expression, enhancing dopamine synthesis from L-DOPA, which is crucial for its antiparkinsonian effects. Amantadine is known to block dopamine reuptake, increasing extracellular dopamine levels, which helps in managing Parkinson’s symptoms. The evidence leans toward Amantadine indirectly interacting with D2 receptors by raising dopamine levels, though it doesn’t directly bind to them, affecting receptor activity. Research suggests Amantadine stimulates noradrenergic responses, potentially enhancing noradrenaline release, which may contribute to its effects on mood and fatigue. It appears Amantadine has immunomodulatory effects, reducing T lymphocytes and altering cytokine levels, which could be relevant in conditions like multiple sclerosis. Beyond the listed terms, Amantadine also shows effects like NMDA receptor antagonism, acting as a sigma-1 receptor agonist, and modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, among others, expanding its therapeutic potential. Amantadine is identified as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, particularly affecting PDE1, with an IC50 of approximately 5 μM, potentially increasing cyclic AMP levels. This action may contribute to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, as noted in studies like Kakkar et al. (1997) and Sancesario et al. (2014). This effect is significant in neurological conditions, where PDE1 inhibition can modulate cAMP signaling, potentially reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Research, including a 1998 study by Hsu et al., demonstrates that Amantadine increases AADC mRNA in PC12 cells at concentrations of 10 and 100 μM, enhancing the enzyme’s activity by up to 27% in human striatum imaging studies. This increase is crucial for dopamine synthesis from L-DOPA, supporting its role in Parkinson’s disease therapy, as seen in studies like those by UCL Discovery. Amantadine’s ability to block dopamine reuptake is well-documented, with studies showing it increases extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum, an effect attenuated by coadministration of nomifensine, a known dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This action, detailed in research by Mizoguchi et al. (1994), enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, aiding in symptom management for Parkinson’s and depression-like conditions. While Amantadine does not directly bind to D2 receptors, it indirectly interacts with them by increasing dopamine levels, which can enhance D2 receptor activity. This is supported by studies like Moresco et al. (2002), which observed increased [11C-]raclopride binding, indicating higher D2 receptor availability, likely due to elevated dopamine. This indirect effect is part of its dopaminergic actions, as noted in Wikipedia and ScienceDirect overviews. Amantadine’s noradrenergic effects include stimulating norepinephrine release, as evidenced by studies like Farnebo et al. (1971), which suggest it enhances noradrenergic transmission. This action is part of its broader neurotransmitter modulation, potentially contributing to its antidepressant and fatigue-reducing effects in conditions like multiple sclerosis, as seen in reviews by PMC. Amantadine exhibits immunomodulatory effects, reducing T lymphocytes and altering cytokine levels (e.g., IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ), as shown in studies on multiple sclerosis patients by Clark et al. (1989) and Wandinger et al. (1999). This action is particularly relevant in neuroinflammatory conditions, with evidence from ScienceDirect indicating its anti-inflammatory function. NMDA Receptor Antagonism: Amantadine acts as a weak, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, stabilizing channel closure and reducing glutamatergic excitotoxicity, as detailed in Blanpied et al. (2005). Sigma-1 Receptor Agonist: It binds to and activates sigma-1 receptors, potentially contributing to neuroprotection, as noted in DrugBank and Wikipedia overviews. Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Negative Allosteric Modulator: Amantadine modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting cholinergic signaling, which may play a role in its side effect profile and therapeutic actions. Induction of GDNF Expression: Studies like Caumont et al. (2006) report that Amantadine induces glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression in astroglia, supporting neuronal survival and potentially aiding in neurodegenerative disease management. Antiviral Action: Its inhibition of the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus prevents viral replication, though resistance has limited its use, as noted in MedlinePlus. Possible Weak 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonist: Some research suggests weak antagonistic effects at 5-HT3 receptors, potentially contributing to its effects on nausea and mood, though this is less studied. Blockade of Certain Ion Channels: Amantadine blocks ion channels like those encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Protein E, ORF10), and studies on viral potassium channels suggest it affects channel function, as seen in PMC articles.

    "title": "Amoxicillin",
    "url": "wiki/alone-amoxicillin.html",
    "content": "Amoxicillin Pharmacological Actions Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin class, primarily exerting its pharmacological action by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It achieves this by competitively binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP1 and other high molecular weight PBPs, which are crucial for glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase reactions. These reactions cross-link D-alanine and D-aspartic acid in the bacterial cell wall, and their inhibition prevents proper cell wall formation. As a result, bacteria upregulate autolytic enzymes, leading to cell wall disruption and bactericidal activity against susceptible gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria, such as Streptococcus species, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus spp. While its primary action is antibacterial, amoxicillin does not exhibit significant pharmacological effects on human cells beyond potential side effects, which are not considered intended actions. Its spectrum of activity includes coverage against beta-lactamase-negative isolates, making it effective for infections like ear, nose, throat, lower respiratory, and urinary tract infections, as well as Helicobacter pylori eradication. Pharmacokinetic Parameters The pharmacokinetic profile of amoxicillin is well-documented, with the following key parameters: Half-Life: The elimination half-life is approximately 61.3 minutes, indicating rapid clearance from the body, which necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic levels. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is reported to vary across studies, with values ranging from 60% to 93%. Recent sources, such as DrugBank and the electronic medicines compendium (emc), suggest approximately 60-70%, while older studies (e.g., a 1977 PMC article) reported 93% based on AUC comparisons with intravenous administration. This discrepancy may reflect differences in formulations or study conditions, with the consensus leaning toward 60-70% for standard oral administration. The absorption is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) typically reached within 1-2 hours, and is not significantly influenced by food intake, though some sources suggest taking it with food for better absorption. Detailed Pharmacokinetic Values: For a 250 mg oral dose: Cmax 3.93 ± 1.13 mg/L, Tmax 1.31 ± 0.33 hours, AUC 27.29 ± 4.72 mg*h/L. For an 875 mg oral dose: Cmax 11.21 ± 3.42 mg/L, Tmax 1.52 ± 0.40 hours, AUC 55.04 ± 12.68 mg*h/L. Volume of distribution: 27.7 L, indicating moderate distribution into body tissues. Protein binding: Approximately 17-20%, suggesting minimal binding and high free drug availability. Clearance: Mean clearance is 21.3 L/h, with 70-78% excreted unchanged in urine within 6-8 hours, primarily via renal elimination. Other Routes: Intramuscular administration shows high bioavailability, with AUC 92% of intravenous, and urinary recovery at 91%, indicating complete and reliable absorption compared to oral routes. Dosage Guidelines Dosing recommendations vary by age, weight, infection severity, and renal function, with the following details: Standard Adult Doses: For mild to moderate infections (e.g., ear, nose, throat, genitourinary, skin): 500 mg every 12 hours or 250 mg every 8 hours. For severe infections: 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours, with durations typically 10-14 days for certain conditions. For Helicobacter pylori (triple therapy): 1 g every 12 hours with lansoprazole and clarithromycin for 14 days. For prophylaxis (e.g., infective endocarditis): 2 g 30-60 minutes before procedure. Pediatric Doses: For infants <3 months: Up to 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours. For children >3 months and <40 kg, mild to moderate: 25 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours or 20 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; severe: 45 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours or 40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours. For community-acquired pneumonia (off-label, ≥3 months): Up to 90 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, not exceeding 4,000 mg/day, for 10 days. Dosage Forms and Strengths: Dosage Forms and Strengths: Form Strengths Oral Suspension 125mg/5mL, 200mg/5mL, 250mg/5mL, 400mg/5mL Capsule 250mg, 500mg Tablet 500mg, 875mg Tablet, Chewable 125mg, 250mg Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range aligns with standard doses, typically 250-875 mg every 8-12 hours for adults, depending on severity. The minimum effective dose varies by infection, often starting at 250 mg every 8 hours for mild cases. Maximum Safe Dose: The usual maximum is 875 mg per dose or 2 g/day for suspension, but in high-risk cases (e.g., acute bacterial sinusitis), doses up to 4 g/day (2 g twice daily) may be used, though not routinely recommended without medical oversight. LD50 and Toxicity: LD50 in rats is >15 g/kg orally and >2000 mg/kg dermally, indicating low acute toxicity. For humans, therapeutic doses are far below these levels, suggesting a wide safety margin. Overdose and Danger Threshold: Research, including a prospective study of 51 pediatric patients, suggests overdoses <250 mg/kg are not associated with significant clinical symptoms. For a 70 kg adult, this equates to ~17.5 g, far above typical doses. Higher doses may lead to renal issues like interstitial nephritis or crystalluria, potentially causing kidney failure, but these are reversible with cessation and supportive care. Poison control notes that overdoses are rarely dangerous, with symptoms like stomach upset and diarrhea, and serious effects require very high doses."

    "title": "AMT HCI",
    "url": "wiki/alone-amt.html",
    "content": "AMT HCI Pharmacological Actions AMT exhibits a range of pharmacological effects, primarily through its interaction with monoamine systems. It acts as a releasing agent for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, with specific EC50 values indicating potency: serotonin release ranges from 22 to 68 nM, dopamine from 79 to 112 nM, and norepinephrine from 79 to 180 nM. Additionally, AMT is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, with notable activity at the 5-HT2A receptor, showing an EC50 of 23 nM and an Emax of 103%, suggesting strong agonist properties. It also functions as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), with an IC50 of 380 nM, and its potency in rats is comparable to harmaline at 7 μM/kg (1.5 mg/kg harmaline, 1.2 mg/kg AMT). These actions contribute to its stimulant, entactogenic, and psychedelic effects, mediated by increased neurotransmitter availability and receptor activation. Metabolites identified in male Wistar rats include 2-Oxo-αMT, 6-hydroxy-αMT, 7-hydroxy-αMT, and 1′-hydroxy-αMT, indicating metabolic pathways involving hydroxylation and conjugation, consistent with tryptamine metabolism. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of AMT are not fully elucidated in the literature. The onset of action is typically 3-4 hours, with effects lasting 12-24 hours, suggesting a prolonged duration that may indicate a long half-life. However, specific half-life data is not available, though the alpha substitution is noted to make AMT a poor substrate for MAO-A, potentially prolonging its presence in the system. Bioavailability, particularly for the oral route, is not quantitatively documented, but its effectiveness when taken orally implies sufficient absorption, supported by predicted high human intestinal absorption (probability 1.0) and blood-brain barrier penetration (probability 0.9856) from ADMET models. Metabolic studies in human hepatocytes show slow metabolism, with a 25% decrease in signal intensity after 3 hours, which may explain the prolonged psychedelic effects. Postmortem concentrations in overdose cases range from 2.0 µg/mL to 4.7 µg/mL in blood, with higher levels in urine and bile, but these do not directly translate to pharmacokinetic parameters like half-life or bioavailability. Pharmacokinetics Dosage recommendations vary based on intended effects and user reports. For antidepressant purposes, under the brand name Indopan, doses of 5-10 mg were prescribed. Recreational use for psychedelic effects typically starts at 20-30 mg, with strong effects at 40-60 mg and heavy effects at 60-80 mg. Erowid reports include individuals taking doses as high as 400 mg, though with severe effects, and recommends starting at threshold or light levels (5-25 mg) to avoid dangerously strong reactions, especially for new users or with new batches. The minimum effective dose for psychedelic effects is around 20 mg, while doses above 60 mg are associated with increased risks, including hospitalization, based on unverifiable reports. Safety and Toxicity Safety concerns are significant, particularly at higher doses. Doses exceeding 60 mg have been linked to hospitalization, and there were 22 deaths associated with AMT in England and Wales from 2012 to 2015, though exact doses are not specified. Case reports, such as a fatality in Miami in 2003, involved a 22-year-old college student with postmortem blood concentrations of 2.0 mg/L, but ingested dose is unclear. Another case reported a plasma concentration of 440 µg/L with severe serotoninergic syndrome, indicating potential toxicity at high exposures. Animal toxicity data from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) lists an oral LD50 of less than 5 mg/kg, dermal LD50 less than 50 mg/kg, and inhalation LD50 less than 0.5 mg/L/4h, classifying it as Acute Tox. 2, indicating high acute toxicity. However, this animal data seems inconsistent with human use, where doses up to 80 mg (approximately 1.14 mg/kg for a 70 kg person) are reported without immediate fatality, though with significant adverse effects. This discrepancy highlights the need for caution, as individual sensitivity varies widely, and AMT's MAO-A inhibition may increase risks of interactions with tyramine-rich foods or other drugs, potentially leading to hypertensive crises or serotonin syndrome. The maximum safe dose without high risks is difficult to determine, but based on reports, it seems likely that doses above 60-80 mg are increasingly dangerous, with potential for severe adverse effects like anxiety, tachycardia, vomiting, and in extreme cases, fatality. The evidence leans toward starting with low doses and having a trusted companion present, given the variability in response. Time Influence and Risk Assessment The influence of AMT's pharmacological actions over time is reflected in its long duration (12-24 hours), which may be due to slow metabolism and prolonged neurotransmitter effects. The onset, taking 3-4 hours, can lead to redosing errors, increasing overdose risk, as effects may take time to fully develop. Risks increase significantly at higher doses, with reports of severe reactions at 40 mg and above, and fatalities associated with use, particularly in polydrug contexts. Conclusion AMT's pharmacological profile includes monoamine release, serotonin receptor agonism, and MAO-A inhibition, with effects lasting 12-24 hours and significant safety concerns at doses above 60 mg. While exact half-life and bioavailability data are lacking, its oral effectiveness is clear. Dosage should start low, with careful monitoring for adverse effects, given the potential for severe toxicity and fatalities at higher exposures. Further research is needed to clarify pharmacokinetics and establish precise LD50 values in humans, given the controversy around animal data and human use patterns."

    "content": "Aspartic acid Aspartic acid, particularly the L-form, is thought to act as a neurotransmitter, exciting neurons in the brain. While less common, D-aspartic acid is used as a dietary supplement and may influence hormone levels, such as increasing testosterone. This is more of a supplement claim and not a standard pharmacological use, with mixed research results. Is non-essential, as the body can synthesize it from oxaloacetate and glutamate, particularly in the liver and muscles ( Aspartic Acid in Health and Disease ). Research suggests that aspartic acid, particularly L-aspartic acid, acts as a potent neuronal excitant, activating the same receptors as glutamic acid. The excitatory nature of aspartic acid can contribute to excitotoxicity under pathological conditions, where excessive activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors may lead to brain injury. This is managed by Na+-dependent transport mechanisms to clear EAAs, highlighting the importance of its transport in limiting potential neurotoxicity ( Aspartic Acid - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ). It is particularly important in maintaining intracellular NAD(H) redox balance via the malate-aspartate shuttle and facilitating amino acid metabolism ( Aspartic Acid in Health and Disease ). D-aspartic acid, distinct from L-aspartic acid, has been studied for its potential pharmacology actions in hormone regulation, particularly testosterone. It is naturally found in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and testes, and is often used as a dietary supplement to increase testosterone and growth hormone levels, potentially improving sexual potency and athletic performance ( D-Aspartic Acid benefits, dosage, and side effects ). Research, such as studies on resistance-trained men, shows mixed results, with some indicating increased testosterone in sedentary individuals but less effect in trained athletes, suggesting dosage and baseline hormone levels may influence outcomes ( Three and six grams supplementation of d-aspartic acid in resistance trained men | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition ).

    "content": "Aticaprant Pharmacological Actions Aticaprant's primary pharmacological action is as a selective antagonist of the KOR, with a binding affinity (Ki) of 0.81 nM, showing approximately 30-fold selectivity over the mu-opioid receptor (MOR, Ki = 24.0 nM) and delta-opioid receptor (DOR, Ki = 155 nM) Wikipedia: Aticaprant . This selectivity suggests its main effect is on KOR-mediated processes, such as mood regulation, stress response, and reward systems, which are implicated in MDD, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders like alcoholism and cocaine dependence. At higher doses, such as 25 mg and 60 mg, it has been shown to dose-dependently block fentanyl-induced miosis, indicating significant MOR antagonism at these levels, which could influence pain perception and opioid-related side effects Wikipedia: Aticaprant . The time course of these actions is tied to its pharmacokinetics. Research indicates rapid absorption, with maximal concentrations (Tmax) occurring 1 to 2 hours post-administration, as determined in both animal and human studies MedChemExpress: Aticaprant , Wikipedia: Aticaprant . Given its half-life of 30-40 hours, the effects are likely sustained, with steady-state concentrations reached after 6 to 8 days of once-daily dosing Wikipedia: Aticaprant. A positron emission tomography (PET) study by Naganawa et al. (2016) showed that at 10 mg, Aticaprant nearly saturates KOR receptors 2.5 hours post-dose, with maximum occupancy estimated at 93%, and occupancy likely persists at 24 hours due to the long half-life Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics: Receptor Occupancy . Pharmacokinetic Parameters Key pharmacokinetic parameters include: Half-life: Estimated at 30 to 40 hours in healthy subjects, supporting its suitability for once-daily dosing Wikipedia: Aticaprant . Bioavailability (oral): Reported as 25%, based on animal studies (rats and mice), with human data confirming oral administration but not specifying exact bioavailability beyond this MedChemExpress: Aticaprant , Wikipedia: Aticaprant . Other routes of administration were not detailed in the available literature. Time to Peak Concentration (Tmax): 1 to 2 hours, indicating rapid absorption MedChemExpress: Aticaprant , Wikipedia: Aticaprant . Steady-State Concentrations: Achieved after 6 to 8 days of once-daily dosing, aligning with its long half-life Wikipedia: Aticaprant . These parameters suggest Aticaprant's effects are prolonged, with significant receptor occupancy early after dosing and sustained activity over days, which is critical for its potential therapeutic use. Dosage and Safety Profile Dosage information from clinical trials provides insight into its use and safety: Therapeutic Dose: In a phase 2 study for MDD, 10 mg once daily was used as an adjunct to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), showing significant improvement in depressive symptoms Nature: Efficacy and Safety . This is considered the minimum effective dose based on efficacy data. Doses Tested: Range from 0.5 mg to 60 mg, with PET studies using up to 25 mg and higher doses (25 mg, 60 mg) assessed for MOR antagonism Wikipedia: Aticaprant , Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics: Receptor Occupancy . Safe Range: Up to 25 mg was well-tolerated in studies, with no serious adverse events reported. At 10 mg, common side effects included headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and pruritus, mostly mild to moderate Nature: Efficacy and Safety . Doses up to 60 mg have been tested, but specific safety data at these levels are limited. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Not explicitly stated, but given testing up to 60 mg and lack of reported serious adverse events at lower doses, it seems likely that up to 25 mg is safe, with caution at higher doses due to potential MOR effects. LD50: Not publicly available, reflecting Aticaprant's status as a drug in development, with toxicity data typically limited to preclinical animal studies not detailed in public sources. When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Not specified, but at doses ≥25 mg, significant MOR antagonism may occur, potentially leading to additional side effects like those associated with opioid receptor antagonism, such as hypotension or dysrhythmias, as noted in related literature Taylor & Francis: Aticaprant Review . The discontinuation of phase III trials in March 2025 due to lack of effectiveness highlights the challenges in its development, but does not negate the pharmacological data from earlier phases Wikipedia: Aticaprant . Detailed Considerations The survey note also considers potential secondary effects and interactions. Aticaprant's KOR antagonism may influence pain perception, stress responses, and reward systems, given KOR's role in these areas. Its interaction with ethanol was noted to have no significant cognitive or motor effects, suggesting compatibility with alcohol consumption in some contexts Taylor & Francis: Aticaprant Review . However, potential side effects like pruritus and bowel irritation are monitored due to KOR antagonism's effects on itching and irritable bowel syndrome Taylor & Francis: Aticaprant Review .

    "title": "Azithromycin",
    "url": "wiki/alone-azithromycin.html",
    "content": "Azithromycin Pharmacological Actions and Mechanisms Azithromycin's primary pharmacological action is as a bacteriostatic antibiotic, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, specifically the 23S rRNA, which prevents transpeptidation and translocation. This action is crucial for treating infections caused by susceptible bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, research suggests Azithromycin has immunomodulatory effects, reducing inflammation, which has been explored for chronic respiratory conditions like asthma, though responsiveness varies with individual lung microbiome composition. The mechanism also includes inhibition of Protein-arginine deiminase type-4 in humans, though its clinical significance is less clear. These actions contribute to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and potential anti-inflammatory benefits, particularly in long-term use scenarios. Timing of Pharmacological Actions The timing of Azithromycin's effects is influenced by its pharmacokinetics. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are typically reached in 2-3 hours, reflecting rapid absorption. Its long terminal elimination half-life of approximately 68 hours allows for sustained antibacterial activity, with tissue concentrations remaining above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for susceptible bacteria for several days post-treatment. This prolonged presence supports once-daily dosing and shorter treatment courses compared to other antibiotics. The immunomodulatory effects, while less studied for timing, likely manifest over days to weeks, given their role in chronic conditions, but specific onset times are not well-documented in the literature. Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability Azithromycin's pharmacokinetics are characterized by: Absorption: Oral bioavailability is approximately 37-38%, mediated by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) efflux transporters, and is not significantly affected by food. Distribution: It has a high volume of distribution (31.1 L/kg), with significant penetration into tissues such as lungs, tonsils, prostate, and phagocytes, contributing to its efficacy against intracellular pathogens. Protein Binding: Serum protein binding decreases from 51% at 0.02 µg/mL to 7% at 2 µg/mL, affecting free drug levels. Metabolism and Elimination: Primarily eliminated via biliary excretion as unchanged drug, with about 6% excreted in urine over a week, and a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min. The long half-life (68 hours for a 3-day regimen, 71.8 hours for a 5-day regimen) underscores its extended duration of action, supporting its use in shorter treatment durations. Dosage Regimens Dosage varies by indication, patient age, and condition severity, as outlined in Table 1 below: Condition Adult Dosage Pediatric Dosage (Weight-Based) Community-Acquired Pneumonia 500 mg Day 1, then 250 mg daily Days 2-5 10 mg/kg Day 1, then 5 mg/kg Days 2-5 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis 500 mg daily for 3 days 10 mg/kg daily for 3 days Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis 500 mg Day 1, then 250 mg daily Days 2-5 12 mg/kg daily for 5 days, max 500 mg/day Genital Ulcer Disease 1 g single dose Not typically indicated Gonococcal Urethritis/Cervicitis 2 g single dose Not typically indicated Acute Otitis Media Not standard for adults 30 mg/kg single dose or 10 mg/kg for 3 days Safe Range: Doses within these regimens are generally considered safe for patients without contraindications, such as known hypersensitivity to macrolides or history of cholestatic jaundice with prior use. Minimum Effective Dose: Varies by condition; for example, a single 1 g dose is effective for uncomplicated chlamydia, while for community-acquired pneumonia, the regimen starting at 500 mg is standard. Maximum Safe Dose: The highest recommended single dose is 2 g for gonococcal infections, with daily doses typically not exceeding 500 mg for most conditions. Long-term prophylaxis may involve 500 mg three times weekly. LD50: Not established for humans; in rats, it's >2000 mg/kg, indicating a wide therapeutic index, but human toxicity is more related to adverse effects than acute lethality. Safety, Toxicity, and Risk Thresholds Azithromycin's safety profile includes common side effects like diarrhea (5-14%), nausea (3-18%), and abdominal pain (3-7%), with serious risks including QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity, and severe allergic reactions. Research suggests toxicity manifests at higher doses, particularly in vulnerable populations: Liver toxicity can include transient transaminase elevations (1-2%) or cholestatic hepatitis, often resolving within 4-8 weeks. QTc prolongation, linked to potential torsades de pointes, is a concern, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions or coadministered drugs affecting CYP 3A4. Case reports, such as a 9-month-old infant receiving 50 mg/kg (about 5 times the usual dose), highlight life-threatening bradycardia and heart block, leading to severe outcomes like anoxic encephalopathy. It seems likely that doses significantly above recommended levels, particularly in those with risk factors, start becoming too dangerous, with cardiac and hepatic effects increasing. For adults, exceeding daily doses of 500 mg, especially in long-term use, or taking single doses above 2 g without medical supervision, could elevate risks, though exact thresholds are patient-specific."

    "title": "Benzylpenicillin",
    "url": "wiki/alone-benzylpenicillin.html",
    "content": "Benzylpenicillin Pharmacological Actions The primary pharmacological action of benzylpenicillin is its bactericidal effect, achieved by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically transpeptidases, preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains in the bacterial cell wall. This leads to an osmotically unstable cell wall, causing cell lysis and bacterial death, particularly effective during active bacterial multiplication. This action is rapid, occurring shortly after administration, and is most pronounced against susceptible gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus, as well as some gram-negative cocci like Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The influence over time is closely tied to its pharmacokinetics. Given its short half-life (0.4–0.9 hours for IV/IM administration), frequent dosing is necessary to maintain therapeutic levels, typically every 4–6 hours. For long-acting forms like benzathine penicillin G, the slow release from the injection site provides sustained low levels, maintaining antibacterial activity over weeks, which is crucial for conditions like syphilis requiring prolonged exposure. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of benzylpenicillin varies by administration route and formulation, as detailed below: Absorption: For IV or IM administration of sodium or potassium salts, absorption is rapid, achieving high initial blood levels. Oral absorption is poor, with bioavailability estimated at 15-30% in fasting, healthy humans, primarily due to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach, making oral administration uncommon. Benzathine penicillin G, administered intramuscularly, is slowly absorbed, leading to transient high initial levels followed by prolonged low concentrations due to its repository nature. Distribution: The volume of distribution is approximately 0.53–0.67 L/kg in adults with normal renal function, indicating good distribution throughout body tissues. It binds to serum proteins, mainly albumin, at a rate of 45-68%. Metabolism: About 16-30% of an IM dose is metabolized to penicilloic acid, an inactive metabolite, with small amounts converted to 6-aminopenicillanic acid and hydroxylated into active metabolites, all excreted via urine. Elimination: Primarily renal, with a clearance rate of 560 ml/min in healthy humans. Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. The short half-life (0.4–0.9 hours) necessitates frequent dosing for IV/IM forms. Half-Life: For sodium/potassium salts (IV/IM): 0.4–0.9 hours. For benzathine penicillin G: Effective levels are maintained for weeks, with studies showing detectable levels up to 4 weeks after a 1.2 million unit IM injection, with a mean apparent terminal half-life of around 189 hours in some reports. Bioavailability: IV: 100% IM (sodium/potassium salts): Nearly 100% Oral: 15-30%, not typically recommended due to poor absorption Benzathine penicillin G: Provides prolonged low levels via slow release, with pharmacokinetics supporting once-every-4-week dosing for some indications like rheumatic fever prophylaxis. Dosage Regimens Dosage varies significantly based on the infection, patient age, and renal function, with specific recommendations as follows: Patient Group Condition Dosage (Units or mg) Route Frequency Adults General infections 600,000–3,600,000 units daily IV/IM Divided 4–6 doses Adults Serious infections (e.g., meningitis) Up to 24 million units/day (14.4 g) IV Divided doses Adults Bacterial endocarditis 7.2–12 g (12–20 million units) daily IV, often infusion As needed Adults Gas gangrene Up to 72 million units/day (43.2 g) IV As needed Children (1 month–12 years) General 100 mg/kg/day (not exceeding 4 g/day) IV/IM Divided 4 doses Infants (1–4 weeks) General 75 mg/kg/day IV/IM Divided 3 doses Newborns General 50 mg/kg/day IV/IM Divided 2 doses Benzathine Penicillin G Syphilis 2.4 million units IM Single dose or weekly Benzathine Penicillin G Streptococcal pharyngitis 1.2 million units IM Single dose Safe Range: Generally, 600,000 to 24 million units daily for adults, with higher doses (up to 72 million units/day) used for severe infections under close monitoring. Minimum Effective Dose: Varies by infection; for example, 1.2 million units IM for streptococcal pharyngitis, but must be tailored to microbial susceptibility and condition severity. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Up to 24 million units/day for most serious infections, with 72 million units/day reported for gas gangrene, though individual tolerance, especially renal function, must be considered. LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: LD50 is not typically reported for humans, but research suggests a convulsant dose of approximately 5 g/kg IV, far exceeding therapeutic levels. Toxicity, particularly CNS effects like convulsions, increases at high doses, especially in renal impairment, with interstitial nephritis reported at doses >12 g/day. Safety and Toxicity Benzylpenicillin has a relatively low toxicity profile at therapeutic doses, with a high therapeutic index. However, several adverse effects and toxicity concerns exist: Common Side Effects: Include diarrhea, allergic reactions (urticaria, rashes, anaphylaxis), and, rarely, CNS toxicity (convulsions, especially at high doses or in severe renal impairment). Serious Reactions: Interstitial nephritis at doses >12 g/day, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported. Overdose Management: Discontinue the drug if neurotoxicity is suspected, with IV benzodiazepines and EEG monitoring for refractory cases, as it may inhibit GABA transmission. The evidence leans toward careful monitoring in patients with renal impairment, as the drug's renal excretion means accumulation can lead to toxicity. Allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis, are a significant concern and require pre-treatment assessment.

    "title": "Cefuroxime",
    "url": "wiki/alone-cefuroxime.html",
    "content": "Cefuroxime Pharmacological Actions Cefuroxime exerts its primary pharmacological action as a β-lactam antibiotic, specifically targeting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacterial cell wall. This interference weakens the cell wall, leading to bacterial lysis and death, classifying it as bactericidal. It is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including: Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other: Borrelia burgdorferi (relevant for Lyme disease) This broad-spectrum activity makes Cefuroxime suitable for treating various infections, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and early Lyme disease. Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life and Bioavailability Half-Life: The half-life of Cefuroxime, which indicates the time taken for the plasma concentration to reduce by half, is approximately 1-2 hours in adults for both oral and parenteral administration. This duration can extend in patients with impaired renal function, as the drug is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. For children, the half-life ranges from 1.4 to 1.9 hours, influenced by age and renal function. Bioavailability: Bioavailability, or the fraction of the drug absorbed into systemic circulation, varies by route: Oral (Cefuroxime axetil): When taken on an empty stomach, bioavailability is 37%, but it increases to 52% when administered with food. This enhancement is due to improved absorption in the presence of food, which may reduce gastrointestinal degradation. Parenteral (IV/IM): For intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration, bioavailability is effectively 100%, as the drug is directly introduced into the bloodstream. Peak serum concentrations are achieved rapidly, within 2-3 minutes post-IV and 30-45 minutes post-IM. Additional pharmacokinetic parameters include: Time to peak concentration (Tmax): 2-3 hours for oral in adults, 3-4 hours in children. Volume of distribution: 0.25-0.3 L/kg, with 33-50% plasma protein binding, allowing penetration into tissues like tonsils, lungs, and bone. Dosage Regimens and Safety Ranges Dosage for Cefuroxime varies based on the infection type, route of administration, patient age, and renal function. Below is a detailed breakdown: Adults: Oral: Pharyngitis/tonsillitis: 250 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. Sinusitis: 250 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. Bronchitis: 250-500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs): 125-250 mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days. Gonorrhea: 1.5 g IM as a single dose at two sites, often with 1 g oral probenecid. Early Lyme disease: 500 mg every 12 hours for 20 days. Parenteral (IV/IM): Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia: 750 mg every 8 hours. Skin and skin structure infections: 750 mg every 8 hours. Meningitis: Up to 3 g every 8 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 9 g in severe cases. Pediatrics (3 months-12 years): Oral: Pharyngitis/tonsillitis: 20 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, maximum 500 mg/day. Parenteral: 75-150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours, maximum 6 g/day. Renal Impairment Adjustments: For CrCl 10-30 mL/min, oral doses may be given every 24 hours; for CrCl <10 mL/min, every 48 hours. Parenteral: For CrCl 10-20 mL/min, 750 mg twice daily; for CrCl <10 mL/min, 750 mg once daily. Hemodialysis patients may require an additional dose post-dialysis. Safe Range, Minimum Effective Dose, and Maximum Safe Dose: The safe range aligns with prescribed doses for specific indications, typically 250-500 mg orally every 12 hours for mild to moderate infections in adults. The minimum effective dose varies by infection and pathogen sensitivity, often starting at 125 mg for UTIs. The maximum safe dose without high risks is generally the highest recommended dose, such as 500 mg orally every 12 hours or 1.5 g IV/IM every 8 hours, with higher doses (e.g., 3 g every 8 hours for meningitis) used under close monitoring. LD50 and Toxicity: LD50: Animal studies indicate an intravenous LD50 of 10.4 g/kg in mice, with higher doses tolerated in other species (e.g., 10 g/kg subcutaneous in mice, 4 g/kg IV in rats). However, human LD50 data are not available, and extrapolation from animal studies should be done cautiously. Toxicity and Overdose: Overdose can lead to neurological sequelae, including encephalopathy, convulsions, and coma, particularly in patients with renal impairment if doses are not adjusted. Serum levels can be reduced by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Other toxicities include: Neurotoxicity, especially in the elderly or those with severe renal impairment or central nervous system disorders. Potential renal impairment when used concurrently with potent diuretics or aminoglycosides, requiring monitoring. Overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms, such as Candida and Clostridium difficile, potentially leading to pseudomembranous colitis. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening. Estimation of When It Becomes Too Dangerous: The risk increases significantly in patients with renal impairment if doses are not adjusted, leading to drug accumulation and potential neurotoxicity. Concurrent use with nephrotoxic drugs further heightens this risk. For patients with normal renal function, adhering to recommended doses is generally safe, but exceeding these, especially without medical supervision, can lead to serious adverse effects, particularly neurological and renal complications. Pharmacodynamic Considerations and Time Influence The user’s request for “values for each time to know how each pharmacological action influences” may refer to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships, particularly how drug concentrations over time affect efficacy. For cephalosporins like Cefuroxime, the key PK-PD index is the percentage of the dosing interval that the unbound concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target pathogen (%T>MIC). Research suggests that for gram-positive bacteria, efficacy is associated with %T>MIC of 40-50%, and for gram-negative bacteria, 60-70%. Specific values depend on the pathogen’s MIC, which varies, but generally: Peak concentrations are achieved within hours (2-3 hours orally, minutes IV), influencing early bactericidal activity. With a half-life of 1-2 hours, multiple doses every 8-12 hours maintain therapeutic levels, ensuring sustained activity above MIC."

    "title": "Citicoline",
    "url": "wiki/alone-citicoline.html",
    "content": "Citicoline Pharmacological Actions Citicoline’s pharmacological actions are multifaceted, primarily centered on supporting neuronal health and function: Enhancement of Phospholipid Synthesis: Citicoline acts as a precursor for phosphatidylcholine, crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes. It is involved in the CDP-choline pathway, where it is converted into phosphatidylcholine via the enzyme diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. This action is vital for membrane repair and maintenance, especially in conditions like ischemia where membrane integrity is compromised ( source ). Neuroprotective Effects: Citicoline exhibits neuroprotective properties through several mechanisms, including preservation of cardiolipin and sphingomyelin, restoration of phosphatidylcholine levels, and stimulation of glutathione synthesis, which has antioxidant effects. It also reduces phospholipase A2 activity and decreases arachidonic acid levels, particularly important post-ischemia to mitigate inflammation and cell damage. These effects are suggested to protect against neuronal injury in conditions like stroke and traumatic brain injury ( source ). Increase in Acetylcholine Synthesis: By providing choline, Citicoline supports the synthesis of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for memory, learning, and muscle control. This is particularly relevant in cognitive enhancement, as acetylcholine levels are often reduced in age-related cognitive decline. The brain preferentially uses choline for acetylcholine synthesis, which can limit availability for phospholipid synthesis, making Citicoline supplementation beneficial ( source ). Potential Modulation of Other Neurotransmitters: There is emerging evidence that Citicoline may increase brain levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin, potentially explaining its antidepressant effects in some studies, though this is less robust and requires further research ( source ). Time Course of Actions The time course for Citicoline’s pharmacological actions varies depending on the specific effect and condition: Phospholipid Synthesis and Neuroprotection: Given Citicoline’s rapid metabolism, with hydrolysis occurring within minutes in the liver, effects on phospholipid synthesis and neuroprotection likely begin within hours. In acute settings like stroke, administration within 24 hours is common, with outcomes such as reduced infarct size observed over days to weeks in animal models ( source ). Acetylcholine Synthesis: The increase in acetylcholine levels is likely to occur shortly after administration, potentially within hours, as Citicoline provides choline that can be rapidly utilized by cholinergic neurons. However, clinical cognitive benefits, such as improved memory, are typically observed after weeks of supplementation, with studies showing improvements after 12 weeks in older adults with memory impairment ( source ). Long-Term Cognitive Effects: For chronic conditions like age-related cognitive decline, benefits are generally seen over extended periods, often requiring consistent daily intake for several weeks to months, as seen in trials like the IDEALE study ( source ). Half-Life and Bioavailability Citicoline’s pharmacokinetics are complex due to its rapid metabolism: Half-Life: Citicoline itself has a very short plasma half-life, likely on the order of minutes, as it is quickly hydrolyzed in the intestine and liver into choline and cytidine. The elimination half-lives of its metabolites are reported as approximately 56 hours for CO2 via respiration and 71 hours for urinary excretion, reflecting the longer duration of metabolite clearance ( source ). Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is nearly 100%, with absorption being virtually complete, as noted in pharmacological reviews. This high bioavailability is comparable to intravenous administration, where bioavailability is 100% by definition. The drug is water-soluble, with minimal excretion in feces, supporting its efficient absorption ( source ). Dosage Information Dosage recommendations and safety profiles are well-established in clinical and supplemental use: Typical Doses: Doses range from 250 mg to 2000 mg per day, depending on the indication. For cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals, doses of 250–1000 mg per day are common, while for medical conditions like stroke, doses up to 2000 mg per day are used ( source ). Safe Range: The safe range is considered up to 2000 mg per day, with clinical trials supporting this level without significant adverse effects. Data from meta-analyses show adverse event frequencies comparable to placebo at these doses ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose varies by condition; for cognitive support, 250 mg per day may suffice, but effectiveness can depend on individual factors and specific studies, with some trials using 500 mg as a starting point ( source ). Maximum Safe Dose: Doses up to 2000 mg per day are commonly used in clinical settings, with no significant safety concerns reported, suggesting this as the practical maximum safe dose ( source ). LD50: The lethal dose for 50% of subjects (LD50) is approximately 8 g/kg orally in rodents, indicating very low toxicity. For a 70 kg human, this translates to 560 g, far exceeding typical therapeutic doses, underscoring its safety profile ( source ). Dangerous Levels: Given the high LD50, Citicoline is unlikely to become dangerous at standard doses. Adverse effects are rare and mild, typically gastrointestinal, such as stomach pain and diarrhea, with no evidence of serious toxicity at therapeutic levels. Risks might emerge at doses in the grams per kilogram range, which are not relevant for human use ( source )."

It also has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, potentially aiding in fighting infections. However, its hormonal content, like IGF-1, may influence growth, though this is still being researched. Beyond nutrition, cow milk has bioactive compounds like transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), used in treating conditions like Crohn’s disease, showing its potential beyond just food. Cow milk is primarily composed of water (about 87%), with the remainder consisting of proteins, fats, lactose, vitamins, and minerals. The average composition, as outlined in \"Milk composition and microbiology - Milk composition\", includes 4.9% lactose, 3.4% fat, 3.3% protein, and 0.7% minerals. Cow milk, particularly colostrum, contains high levels of antibodies and immune factors, which can modulate the immune system. Lactoferrin, a key protein found in cow milk at concentrations of 2–3 g/L. Cow milk contains casein, which can be broken down into casomorphins, peptides with opioid-like activity.

    "title": "Creatine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-creatine.html",
    "content": "Creatine Pharmacological Actions Creatine’s primary pharmacological action is to facilitate the recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP through the donation of phosphate groups from phosphocreatine. This process, catalyzed by creatine kinase, is crucial for rapid energy production during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. This mechanism is detailed in sources like Wikipedia: Creatine, which notes its role in ATP recycling, primarily in muscle and brain tissue. Beyond energy metabolism, creatine may exhibit additional actions, including acting as a pH buffer during intense exercise, potentially reducing acidosis. Emerging research suggests possible antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and neuroprotective benefits, particularly in conditions like neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, DrugBank: Creatine lists creatine as a ligand for various creatine kinases and a product of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, indicating its involvement in cellular energy pathways. However, these secondary actions are less established and require further investigation, as noted in Metabolic Basis of Creatine in Health and Disease, which discusses potential mechanisms beyond energy metabolism. Time to Effect and Influence The time to observe creatine’s pharmacological effects depends on the dosing strategy and the specific action in question. For its primary role in enhancing muscle performance, the key is saturating muscle creatine stores. A loading phase of 20-25 grams per day, divided into 4-5 doses, for 5-7 days can achieve saturation quickly, with performance benefits often noticeable within a week, as supported by Creatine Loading Phase: Research, Benefits, Safety, and How To. Without loading, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams daily can take approximately 28 days to achieve similar saturation, as noted in Does one dose of creatine supplementation fit all?. For brain-related effects, such as improved cognitive function, higher single doses (e.g., 0.35 g/kg, or about 24.5 g for a 70 kg person) have shown benefits during sleep deprivation, as seen in Single dose creatine improves cognitive performance, but long-term supplementation may be needed for sustained effects. The influence of these actions is dose-dependent, with higher doses accelerating the onset but potentially increasing side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort. Half-Life The plasma half-life of creatine is approximately 3 hours, as consistently reported in pharmacokinetic studies. This is evident from Creatine - Wikipedia, which states an elimination half-life of just under 3 hours, requiring frequent dosing to maintain elevated plasma levels. This short half-life pertains to plasma clearance and does not reflect the retention time in muscle stores, which can remain elevated for weeks after supplementation ceases, as muscle creatine turnover is slower. Bioavailabilities Creatine monohydrate, the most common supplement form, is considered to have high oral bioavailability, often cited as nearly 100%. This is based on the understanding that it is either absorbed by tissues or excreted in urine, as noted in Bioavailability, Efficacy, Safety, and Regulatory Status of Creatine. However, exact bioavailability percentages in humans are less frequently reported, with animal studies providing some insight. For instance, a rat study found oral bioavailability of 53% at a low dose (10 mg/kg) and 16% at a high dose (70 mg/kg), suggesting dose-dependent absorption, as detailed in Absolute Oral Bioavailability of Creatine Monohydrate in Rats. Given the lack of direct human data, it’s reasonable to conclude that oral bioavailability is high but may vary with dose and formulation, with creatine monohydrate being the most bioavailable form compared to others like creatine lysinate or ethyl ester. Other routes, such as intravenous, are not typically used for supplementation, so bioavailability data for these are limited and not relevant for standard use. Dosages and Safety Profile Dosage Type Details Loading Phase 20-25 grams per day, divided into 4-5 doses (e.g., 5 g every few hours), for 5-7 days, to rapidly saturate muscle stores. Maintenance Dose 3-5 grams per day, sufficient to maintain elevated stores after loading, or as a standalone dose over weeks. Alternative Strategy 0.1-0.14 g/kg/day (e.g., 7-10 g/day for a 70 kg person) without loading, effective for older adults, as seen in Does one dose of creatine supplementation fit all?. Minimum Effective Dose Approximately 3 grams per day, based on studies showing benefits at this level for performance enhancement. Safe Range Generally, up to 20-25 g/day for loading and 3-5 g/day for maintenance are considered safe for healthy individuals, supported by Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation. Maximum Without High Risks Doses up to 30 grams per day have been used in research without serious adverse effects, but higher doses may cause gastrointestinal issues like nausea or diarrhea, as noted in Can You Take Too Much Creatine?. LD50 In animal studies, LD50 is >2000 mg/kg in rats for creatine monohydrate and >8000 mg/kg orally in mice for creatine lysinate, indicating low acute toxicity, from Registration Dossier - ECHA and Creatine lysinate – part I. When It Starts to Become Dangerous There is no specific threshold, but excessive doses beyond recommended levels may lead to side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort, with no clear evidence of serious harm at typical supplementation levels in healthy individuals. Safety is well-supported, with creatine classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA in 2020, as seen in FDA Media. Studies over 25 years show no significant adverse effects on kidney function in healthy individuals at recommended doses, addressing early misconceptions from case studies like a 1998 report of renal dysfunction at 15 g/day for 7 days, later debunked by controlled trials.

Greater Changes in Muscle Fiber Cross-Sectional Area During Rehabilitation +10% Promotes hypertrophy, likely through increased training capacity and cellular signaling. Background and Context Creatine, a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in foods like meat and fish, is synthesized in the body from amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and methionine. It plays a crucial role in energy production, particularly in muscles, by increasing phosphocreatine stores, which help regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during high-intensity exercise. Supplementation, often at doses of 3-5 grams daily after an optional loading phase of 20 grams daily for 5-7 days, is common among athletes and fitness enthusiasts to enhance performance and muscle mass. However, potential negative impacts have been reported, and this section aims to quantify these effects with percentages and explain their pharmacological basis. Comprehensive List of Negative Impacts with Incidences Negative Impact Incidence (Standard Dosing) Incidence (High Single Doses, e.g., 10g) Pharmacological Action Gastrointestinal Distress (Diarrhea) ~5.5% Up to 56% High doses cause osmotic effects in the gut, drawing water and leading to diarrhea.

Liver Damage Very rare, not significantly different from placebo Not specified Anecdotal reports exist, but controlled studies find no significant liver function changes. Detailed Analysis of Each Impact Gastrointestinal Distress: Incidence: A comprehensive analysis of 685 clinical trials involving 12,839 creatine users found that 5.51% reported gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, stomach upset, and belching, compared to 4.05% in placebo groups, with no significant difference (p = 0.820) Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. However, a specific study on top-level athletes taking a single 10g dose reported a 56% incidence of diarrhea, significantly higher than the 28.6% in divided doses (2 x 5g) and 35.0% in placebo, indicating dose-dependent effects Gastrointestinal distress after creatine supplementation in athletes: are side effects dose dependent?. Pharmacology Action: Creatine, particularly in high doses, can exert an osmotic effect in the gastrointestinal tract, drawing water into the intestines and causing diarrhea. This is more pronounced with single large doses due to rapid absorption and concentration in the gut, potentially irritating the stomach lining and leading to stomach upset or belching. Weight Gain due to Water Retention: Incidence: Nearly all users (100%) experience weight gain, typically 1-2 kg, especially during the loading phase (20g/day for 5-7 days). A study found an average increase of 1.7 kg over 4 weeks with high doses (30g initially, then 15g) Creatine monohydrate supplementation on body weight and percent body fat. This effect is consistent across studies, with weight gain primarily due to water retention rather than fat gain. Pharmacology Action: Creatine increases phosphocreatine stores in muscles, which draws water into the cells via osmotic pressure, leading to intracellular water retention. This is a direct result of creatine’s role in enhancing cellular hydration, which can be perceived as unwanted weight gain, especially for those not seeking muscle mass increase. Muscle Cramping/Pain: Incidence: Approximately 0.5% of creatine users reported muscle cramping or pain, compared to 0.07% in placebo groups, with a marginally significant p-value of 0.085, suggesting no strong evidence of increased risk Safety of creatine supplementation: analysis of the prevalence of reported side effects in clinical trials and adverse event reports. Anecdotal reports are common, but controlled studies refute a direct link. Pharmacology Action: The mechanism is unclear, but potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalances might contribute, though studies show creatine may reduce cramping in certain contexts, such as hemodialysis patients, indicating a protective rather than causative role. Other Reported Side Effects: Dehydration, Kidney Damage, Liver Damage, etc.: These are often mentioned anecdotally but lack robust scientific support. The International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand notes that assessments of adverse event reports revealed creatine was rarely mentioned and not associated with significant patterns of adverse events, with no support for increased renal or liver dysfunction International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. A meta-analysis on renal function found no significant alteration in serum creatinine or urea levels, reinforcing safety Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Renal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Incidence: Very rare, with incidences not significantly different from placebo, often less than 1% based on comprehensive analyses. Scientific Evidence and Study Findings Research on creatine's impact on testosterone levels reveals a mixed picture, with the majority of studies suggesting no significant effect. A review by Examine.com: Can creatine increase your testosterone levels? analyzed multiple trials and concluded that it is unlikely to increase testosterone levels, with the preponderance of evidence supporting no notable change. Similarly, Harvard Health: What is creatine? Potential benefits and risks of this popular supplement explicitly states that creatine does not increase testosterone levels, reinforcing the view that it is not an anabolic steroid. However, some studies suggest potential effects. For instance, a study published in PubMed: Three weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation affects dihydrotestosterone to testosterone ratio in college-aged rugby players found no change in serum testosterone levels after 7 days of loading and 14 days of maintenance, but noted changes in the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to testosterone ratio, which could have implications for hair health. In contrast, another study from ScienceDirect: Effects of short term creatine supplementation and resistance exercises on resting hormonal and cardiovascular responses reported significant increases in resting testosterone concentrations after 5 and 7 days of creatine loading combined with resistance exercises, compared to a placebo group. To reconcile these findings, a review in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition: Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation provides insight. It notes that while one study (van der Merwe et al., 2009) found a 56% increase in DHT after 7 days and 40% above baseline after 14 days, most other studies (12 total, with doses ranging from 3–25 g/day for 6 days to 12 weeks) showed no significant increase in total or free testosterone, with only two studies reporting small increases and five showing no change in free testosterone. This suggests that any effect on testosterone is not consistent across studies. Analysis of Variability and Context The variability in findings may be attributed to differences in study design, participant populations, and supplementation protocols. For example, studies combining creatine with resistance training, like the ScienceDirect study, seem more likely to show increases in testosterone, possibly due to the synergistic effect of exercise on hormonal responses. In contrast, studies without specific exercise interventions, like the PubMed rugby player study, tend to show no change. This suggests that the context of use—particularly whether combined with resistance training—may influence outcomes. Additionally, the Examine.com review highlighted that all trials involved healthy young men with normal testosterone levels, and no studies have examined the effect on individuals with abnormally low testosterone. This limits the generalizability of findings to other populations, such as older adults or those with hormonal imbalances. Tables Summarizing Key Studies To organize the evidence, the following tables summarize key studies and their findings: Study Source Participants Dose/Duration Effect on Testosterone/DHT Notes PubMed: Three weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation... 20 college-aged rugby players 25 g/day for 7 days, then 5 g/day for 14 days No change in serum T, increased DHT/T ratio Conducted during competitive season, no exercise details specified ScienceDirect: Effects of short term creatine supplementation... 20 active males 3, 5, 7 days loading with resistance exercises Increased resting T after 5, 7 days (P < 0.05) Included resistance exercises, parallel group design JISSN: Common questions and misconceptions about creatine... Review of 12 studies 3–25 g/day, 6 days to 12 weeks Mostly no significant change, 2 showed small increases Comprehensive review, notes DHT increase in one study not replicated Summary of Examine.com Review (2025) Details 3 RCTs showing small increases Increased DHT by 12 ng/dL, Testosterone by 57 ng/dL and 150 ng/dL 10 trials (218 participants) showing no effect No statistically significant effect on testosterone Conclusion Unlikely to increase testosterone in healthy young men with normal levels These tables illustrate the mixed evidence, with the majority leaning toward no significant effect, but highlighting the potential for small increases in specific contexts. Implications and Considerations For most users, particularly healthy individuals engaging in regular exercise, the evidence suggests that creatine supplementation is unlikely to significantly alter testosterone levels. This is reassuring for those concerned about potential decreases, as no studies indicate a reduction. However, for those hoping for an increase, the small and inconsistent findings mean it's not a reliable strategy for boosting testosterone. It's also worth noting that changes in DHT, as seen in some studies, have been linked to hair loss concerns, but the JISSN review clarifies that these changes remain within normal clinical limits and have not been consistently replicated. This suggests that while there may be minor hormonal shifts, they are unlikely to have significant clinical impacts."

    "content": "Cystine Cystine’s main pharmacological action is as a precursor for Cysteine, which helps produce glutathione, a key antioxidant. This can protect cells from damage, potentially aiding skin conditions where oxidative stress is a factor. Cystine, the oxidized dimer of the amino acid Cysteine, is a sulfur-containing compound with significant biochemical and potential pharmacological roles, particularly in dermatology and cellular health. Cystine is formed by the oxidation of two Cysteine molecules, linked by a disulfide bond. This process is reversible, as Cystine can be converted back to Cysteine through reduction, typically by the addition of hydrogen. This interconversion is crucial, as Cysteine is a precursor for glutathione, a tripeptide (glutamate, cysteine, glycine) known for its antioxidant properties. Glutathione helps neutralize free radicals, protecting cells from oxidative damage, which is particularly relevant in skin health and conditions like acne, where oxidative stress is implicated. Cystine serves as a major precursor for glutathione synthesis Cystine interacts with the cystine-glutamate antiporter (system xc-), a sodium-independent transporter that exchanges extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. This system is critical for maintaining cellular redox balance, as it provides cystine for glutathione synthesis and regulates glutamate levels. Cystine is a component of keratin, a structural protein found in high quantities in hair (constituting about 5% of human hair) and nails. Its deficiency has been shown to slow skin and hair growth, suggesting a role in maintaining tissue integrity. In skin lightening, a randomized controlled trial found that oral supplementation of L-Cystine with reduced L-Glutathione significantly lightened dark spots, suggesting a synergistic effect. Action Mechanism Relevance to Dermatology Precursor for Glutathione Synthesis Converted to Cysteine, supports antioxidant production May help manage oxidative stress in skin conditions like acne Cystine-Glutamate Transporter Interaction Exchanges cystine for glutamate, maintains redox balance Potential influence on skin cell function, limited direct evidence Support for Skin, Hair, Nail Health Component of keratin, structural role Used in supplements for hair loss, nail strength, indirect skin benefits"

    "content": "Dihydromyricetin Pharmacological Actions DHM exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological effects, primarily observed in preclinical studies. These include: Cardioprotection: DHM demonstrates anti-atherosclerotic properties by reducing pyroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at concentrations of 0.5–1 μM via the Nrf2 pathway, and enhances cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophages at 1–100 μM through LXRα, ABCA1, and ABCG1 upregulation ( source ). It also protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury with 7-day pre-treatment, and reduces adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity at 125–500 mg/kg in mice, suppressing apoptosis and ROS. Anti-diabetes: DHM improves insulin sensitivity via AMPK, Akt, and AS160 phosphorylation, with an 8-week treatment reducing blood glucose and plasma insulin in high-fat diet (HFD) rats, and 50 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks enhancing sensitivity in mice, involving the AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 pathway ( source ). Hepatoprotection: DHM protects against liver ischemia/reperfusion injury at 100 mg/kg/d for 7 days, activating autophagy via FOXO3a, Atg5, Atg12, beclin 1, and LC3. It ameliorates alcoholic liver disease at 75–150 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks, activating Nrf2 and inhibiting NF-κB, and improves non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by enhancing mitochondrial function, with a clinical trial using 150 mg twice daily showing benefits ( source ). Neuroprotection: DHM inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity in a dose-dependent manner, protecting dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's models, and shows antidepressant effects at 10–20 mg/kg for 3–7 days, enhancing BDNF and reducing TNF-α, IL-6 ( source ). Anti-tumor: It induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via Akt/Bad and G2/M arrest via Chk2, with autophagy mediated by mTOR, ERK1/2, and AMPK, and shows effects against melanoma at 1.25–10 μM, suppressing proliferation and inducing G1/S arrest ( source ). Dermatoprotection: DHM protects against UVA-induced damage and inhibits melanoma proliferation, with mechanisms involving ROS-NF-κB signaling and tyrosinase inhibition. These actions are supported by mechanisms involving AMPK, MAPK, Akt, NF-κB, Nrf2, and other pathways, as detailed in supplementary materials . Pharmacokinetic Parameters DHM's pharmacokinetics have been studied primarily in rats, with the following parameters: Half-life: Approximately 2.05 hours for intravenous administration at 2 mg/kg and 3.70 hours for oral administration at 20 mg/kg, based on LC-MS/MS analysis. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is low, at 4.02% in rats, due to poor absorption via passive diffusion and efflux by transporters like MRP2 and BCRP, with rapid distribution and elimination mostly in feces within 12 hours ( source ). Efforts to improve bioavailability include solid dispersions, nanocapsules, and phospholipid complexes, which have shown promise in enhancing absorption in animal models. Dosage and Administration Human dosage data is limited but includes: A clinical trial for NAFLD used 150 mg twice daily (300 mg/day) for three months, showing improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism without reported adverse effects ( source ). Suggested dosages for other uses, such as hangover prevention, range from 300 mg per drink to 2000–4000 mg for reducing alcohol intoxication, based on commercial recommendations and extrapolations from animal studies ( source ). Animal studies suggest dosages like 1.8–11.8 mg/kg in rats for behavioral effects, translating to approximately 126–824 mg for a 70 kg human, aligning with clinical trial doses. Safety and Toxicity DHM is generally considered safe, with traditional use in Asia for centuries and minimal adverse effects reported: LD50: Greater than 5 g/kg in mice, indicating low acute toxicity ( source ). Acute Toxicity: No significant side effects at 150 mg/kg to 1.5 g/kg in mice, with a human equivalent dose (HED) suggesting safety up to 15.68 g for a 70 kg person, based on a 22 g/kg no-effect level in mice ( source ). Chronic Toxicity: No negative effects on development, hematology, or pathology in long-term rat studies, with enhanced immunologic function observed ( source ). However, some controversy exists, with studies suggesting potential pro-oxidant and mutagenic effects, though these are not well-supported in human contexts ( source )."

    "content": "DIM Also known as: 3,3′-Diindolylmethane Pharmacological Actions DIM exhibits a wide range of pharmacological actions, supported by both preclinical and clinical evidence. These actions include: Antioxidant Effects: DIM reduces oxidative stress, particularly in radiation-damaged cells, through pathways like NRF2/ARE/HO-1, as noted in studies on cellular protection mechanisms ( source ). Anti-inflammatory Properties: It decreases levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as NO, PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6 in LPS-treated cells, suggesting a role in mitigating inflammation ( source ). Antiapoptotic Activity: DIM increases antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreases pro-apoptotic Bax, potentially protecting cells from programmed cell death, especially in bone marrow cells post-injury ( source ). Immunomodulatory Effects: DIM induces proliferation of splenocytes and augments cytokine production like IFN-γ and IL-12, with effects varying by dose and duration, such as at 100 mg/kg showing significant immune cell modulation ( source ). Anticancer Properties: DIM is noted for inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest (e.g., G1 arrest in breast cancer cells), and inhibiting tumor growth, with mechanisms involving AKT, NF-κB, and FOXO3 pathways, supported by both in vitro and in vivo studies ( source ). Estrogen Metabolism Modulation: DIM alters estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrones to 16α-hydroxyestrone, potentially reducing risks of hormone-related cancers, as seen in thyroid proliferative disease studies ( source ). Histone Deacetylase Inhibition: In vitro, DIM acts as an inhibitor against HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, which may contribute to its anticancer effects ( source ). Mild Cannabinoid Agonist: DIM shows low binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors, suggesting minor cannabinoid-like effects ( source ). Biofilm Reduction: Research indicates DIM can reduce biofilms responsible for dental plaque by up to 90%, potentially aiding oral health ( source ). The influence of these actions over time varies by study, with effects typically observed within hours to weeks depending on dosage and administration route. For instance, anti-inflammatory effects may peak within 24 hours at certain doses, while anticancer effects may require weeks of supplementation to manifest in clinical trials. Half-Life The half-life of DIM in humans, based on pharmacokinetic studies, is approximately 4.3 hours for the parent compound, with variations depending on formulation. For example, a study reported a mean noncompartmental half-life of 4.29 ± 2.48 hours, with metabolites showing longer half-lives, such as 9.34 ± 3.13 hours for monohydroxylated forms ( source ). Bioavailability DIM's bioavailability is naturally low due to poor solubility and limited membrane penetration, particularly in its crystalline form. However, enhanced formulations like BR-DIM significantly improve absorption. In human studies, oral administration of BR-DIM resulted in a Cmax of 111 ± 160 ng/ml and Tmax of 2.67 ± 0.98 hours, indicating improved bioavailability compared to crystalline DIM ( source ). Dosage Considerations Dosage recommendations for DIM vary based on safety, efficacy, and intended use, with the following details derived from clinical and preclinical studies: Safe Range: Clinical studies suggest DIM is safe up to 150-200 mg per day. For instance, a study on single-dose pharmacokinetics found no adverse effects up to 200 mg, with mild side effects like nausea at 300 mg ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose varies by condition, typically ranging from 100 mg to 300 mg per day. For example, studies on estrogen metabolism used 300 mg/day, while chemoprevention trials targeted doses achieving Cmax with less than 150 mg ( source ). Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Doses up to 200 mg per day are well-tolerated, with 300 mg showing infrequent mild side effects like nausea and headache, suggesting a threshold around this level ( source ). When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: At 600 mg per day, there may be risks such as lowering sodium levels, as noted by WebMD, but exact thresholds for danger are not well-established, indicating a need for further research ( source ). LD50: The lethal dose 50 (LD50) for DIM was not found in the available literature, suggesting it may not be determined or is not publicly documented, which underscores the need for additional toxicological studies. Clinical and Safety Considerations Clinical trials have used doses ranging from 50 mg to 300 mg daily, with most studies reporting DIM as safe at lower doses. However, higher doses (e.g., 300 mg) may cause mild adverse effects, and at 600 mg, potential risks like hyponatremia are noted. The lack of LD50 data highlights a gap in toxicological research, and case reports of serious side effects at excessive intakes suggest caution, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women or those on hormonal therapies ( source )."

    "url": "wiki/alone-disulfiram.html",
    "content": "Disulfiram Pharmacological Actions Inhibition of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH): Mechanism: Disulfiram irreversibly inhibits ALDH, particularly ALDH1A1, by competing with NAD at the cysteine residue. This prevents the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid, leading to its accumulation and causing the disulfiram-alcohol reaction, characterized by symptoms such as diaphoresis, palpitations, facial flushing, nausea, vertigo, hypotension, and tachycardia. Time Course: The disulfiram-alcohol reaction typically begins about 10 minutes after alcohol ingestion and can last for 1 hour or more, as noted in clinical observations ( source ). Inhibition of Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH): Mechanism: Disulfiram inhibits DBH, the enzyme converting dopamine to norepinephrine, potentially increasing dopamine levels and decreasing norepinephrine, which may underlie its experimental use in cocaine dependence by correcting underlying dopamine deficits. Time Course: Specific duration data for DBH inhibition is less documented, but given Disulfiram's daily administration, it seems likely that its effects are maintained with regular dosing. Studies on cocaine-related behaviors suggest effects are observed over days with chronic administration, but exact onset and duration remain unclear ( source ). Other Potential Actions: Disulfiram also inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3 member A2 (ALDH3A2) and competitively binds the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, though these actions are less studied and their clinical significance, including time courses, is not well-established ( source ). Pharmacokinetic Properties Half-Life: Disulfiram has a half-life of approximately 7 hours, while its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), has a half-life of about 15 hours. There is significant inter-subject variability, which may stem from differences in metabolism, lipid content, enterohepatic circulation, or protein-binding capacity ( source ). Bioavailability: Oral absorption is reported at 80-90%, indicating high bioavailability via the oral route, which is the standard administration method. This high absorption rate is supported by clinical pharmacokinetics data, though exact bioavailability figures may vary due to metabolic conversion to active metabolites ( source ). Dosage Considerations Forms and Administration: Available as 250 mg and 500 mg oral tablets, which can be crushed and mixed with water, coffee, milk, or fruit juice for administration ( source ). Safe Range: The recommended safe daily dose is up to 500 mg, with no additional benefit observed above this level ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: Typically ranges from 125 mg to 250 mg daily, with some sources indicating effectiveness at 125 mg, particularly for maintenance therapy ( source ). Maximum Dose Without High Risks: 500 mg per day is the maximum recommended dose to avoid significant risks, as higher doses do not enhance efficacy and increase toxicity risk ( source ). Toxic Threshold and LD50: Doses above 500 mg per day can lead to toxicity, with clinical manifestations rare below 3 g in a single dose for adults. Lethal doses are estimated at 10-30 g in a single ingestion for humans, based on case reports and clinical observations ( source )."

    "title": "Fever / Pyrexia",
    "url": "wiki/alone-fever.html",
    "content": "Fever / Pyrexia Anti-infection defense mechanism that appears with body temperature exceeding the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point in the hypothalamus. The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. May rarely trigger a febrile seizure. This is more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (106 to 108 °F). A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening. This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections—such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa fever, COVID-19, and malaria. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications (e.g. ibuprofen or paracetamol) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. One of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, dehydration,and the inability to concentrate. Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called \"fever dreams\". Mild to severe delirium (which can also cause hallucinations) may also present itself during high fevers. Clinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes. Behavior Various patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis: Continuous fever, where temperature remains above normal and does not fluctuate more than 1 °C in 24 hours (e.g. in bacterial pneumonia, typhoid fever, infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, or typhus). Intermittent fever is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal (e.g., in malaria, leishmaniasis, pyemia, sepsis, or African trypanosomiasis). Remittent fever, where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 °C in 24 hours (e.g., in infective endocarditis or brucellosis). Pel–Ebstein fever is a cyclic fever that is rarely seen in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Undulant fever, seen in brucellosis. Typhoid fever is a continuous fever showing a characteristic step-ladder pattern, a step-wise increase in temperature with a high plateau. Among the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are: Quotidian fever, with a 24-hour periodicity, typical of malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi); Tertian fever, with a 48-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. falciparum, P. vivax, or P. ovale; Quartan fever, with a 72-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by P. malariae. Causes Fever is a common symptom of many medical conditions: Infectious disease such as: COVID-19 Dengue Ebola Gastroenteritis HIV Influenza Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Secondary syphilis Malaria Mononucleosis As well as infections of the skin: Abscesses Boils Immunological diseases such as: Relapsing polychondritis Autoimmune hepatitis Granulomatosis with polyangiitis Horton disease Inflammatory bowel diseases Kawasaki disease Lupus erythematosus Sarcoidosis Still's disease Rheumatoid arthritis Lymphoproliferative disorders Psoriasis Tissue destruction As a result of cerebral bleeding Crush syndrome Hemolysis Infarction Rhabdomyolysis Surgery Etc. Cancers, particulary blood cancers such as: Leukemia Lymphomas Metabolic disorders such as: Gout Porphyria Inherited metabolic disorder such as: Fabry disease Adult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever. In addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product. Assist the healing process in ways, including: Increased mobility of leukocytes ; Increased proliferation of T cells . Enhanced leukocyte phagocytosis ; Decreased endotoxin effects; Temperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response. When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate. If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering. These may be: Increased heat production by increased muscle tone, shivering (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like epinephrine; and Prevention of heat loss, e.g., through vasoconstriction."

    "content": "Flibanserin Pharmacological Actions and Their Influence Flibanserin’s pharmacological profile is characterized by its interactions with serotonin and dopamine receptors, which are central to its therapeutic effects in HSDD. It acts as an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, with a high binding affinity (Ki = 1 nM in human cells, as per IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY: flibanserin ), and an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors (Ki = 49 nM, from the same source). Additionally, it exhibits antagonist or weak partial agonist activity at dopamine D4 receptors (Ki = 4-24 nM, as noted in Flibanserin - Wikipedia ), with lower affinities for 5-HT2B (Ki = 89.3 nM) and 5-HT2C (Ki = 88.3 nM) receptors, where it acts as an antagonist Flibanserin - Wikipedia . These interactions lead to a reduction in serotonin levels and an increase in dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to enhance sexual desire and reduce distress associated with HSDD Multifunctional Pharmacology of Flibanserin: Possible Mechanism of Therapeutic Action in Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder | ScienceDirect . The onset of effect was observed from the first measurement point after 4 weeks of treatment, with effects maintained throughout the treatment period, as evaluated in three phase 3 clinical trials Flibanserin - Wikipedia . Specific values for the time course of these actions include a Tmax of 0.75 hours (range 0.75-4.0 hours), indicating rapid absorption and peak plasma concentration, with a half-life of approximately 11 hours influencing the duration of action Fda . The EC50 for agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors is approximately 630.96 nM, suggesting the concentration needed for half-maximal effect in certain functional assays IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY: flibanserin . Half-Life and Bioavailabilities The half-life of Flibanserin is consistently reported as approximately 11 hours across multiple sources, including the FDA label Fda, indicating the time required for the plasma concentration to reduce by half, which is crucial for determining dosing intervals. Its oral bioavailability is 33%, meaning only about a third of the ingested dose is absorbed systemically, a factor influenced by first-pass metabolism primarily via CYP3A4, with lesser involvement of CYP2C19 Flibanserin: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online . Other routes of administration, such as intravenous, are not clinically relevant for Flibanserin, so additional bioavailability data are not available. Dosage Details The recommended dosage for Flibanserin is 100 mg once daily at bedtime, as per the FDA label Fda, which is also considered the minimum effective dose based on clinical trials where lower doses (e.g., 50 mg twice daily) were less effective Flibanserin - Wikipedia . The maximum safe dose is generally 100 mg, with higher doses not recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects, as evidenced by clinical development where doses above 250 mg were not tolerated by adults Accidental Flibanserin Ingestion in Children Causing Acute Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression | PMC . Case reports of accidental ingestion in children provide insight into the effects of higher doses. For instance, doses ranging from 400 mg to 1500 mg (4 to 15 tablets of 100 mg each) led to severe symptoms such as ataxia, somnolence, respiratory depression, and CNS depression, requiring intubation in some cases, but all recovered within a few days with supportive care Accidental Flibanserin Ingestion in Children Causing Acute Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression | PMC . This suggests that while high doses are dangerous, they are not necessarily lethal, though the LD50 for humans is not publicly available. The safe range is thus 100 mg daily, with the FDA contraindicating use with alcohol, moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in hepatic impairment due to increased risk of hypotension and syncope Fda . The estimation of when it starts to become too dangerous aligns with doses above 100 mg, particularly given the narrow safety margin and reports of severe effects at higher doses."

    "content": "Fluoxetine SSRI Fluoxetine can affect the electrical currents that heart muscle cells use to coordinate their contraction, specifically the potassium currents Ito and IKs that repolarise the cardiac action potential. Under certain circumstances, this can lead to prolongation of the QT interval, a measurement made on an electrocardiogram reflecting how long it takes for the heart to electrically recharge after each heartbeat. When fluoxetine is taken alongside other drugs that prolong the QT interval, or by those with a susceptibility to long QT syndrome, there is a small risk of potentially lethal abnormal heart rhythms such as torsades de pointes. A study completed in 2011 found that fluoxetine does not alter the QT interval and has no clinically meaningful effects on the cardiac action potential. Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 enzymes. Patients who are taking NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements must be careful when taking fluoxetine or other SSRIs, as they can sometimes increase the blood-thinning effects of these medications. Fluoxetine inhibit many isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system that are involved in drug metabolism. Potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (which is also the chief enzyme responsible for their metabolism) and CYP2C19, and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.

    "url": "wiki/alone-galantamine.html",
    "content": "Galantamine Galantamine has a dual approach: It stops an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine, letting more of this memory-boosting chemical stay active in the brain. It also enhances the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are like switches that help acetylcholine work better, potentially improving communication between brain cells. Galantamine may protect brain cells from damage by acting as an antioxidant and reducing inflammation. Tertiary alkaloid drug. Reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This enzyme typically hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter critical for memory, thinking, and reasoning, into choline and acetate. By inhibiting AChE, Galantamine increases the concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission. This action is particularly relevant in AD, where cholinergic deficits are a hallmark. Research indicates Galantamine is 50-fold more selective for AChE over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), with an IC50 for AChE of 0.35 μM and for BuChE of 18.6 μM. It has a bioavailability of 80–100%, a protein binding of 18%, and an elimination half-life of 7 hours, with peak AChE inhibition occurring approximately 1 hour after an 8 mg oral dose in healthy volunteers ( source ). Acts as a positive allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 and α4β2 subtypes. This means it binds to allosteric sites on these receptors, triggering a conformational change that enhances their response to ACh. At concentrations of 0.1–1 μM, it potentiates agonist responses, while at higher concentrations (>10 μM), it may inhibit activity ( ). Exhibits significant neuroprotective properties. It acts as an antioxidant, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting neurons from oxidative damage ( source ). Prevents the activation of microglia and astrocytes, key players in neuroinflammation, and counters the expression of inflammatory markers such as NF-κB, p65, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus ( source ). Increases the levels of glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and GABA. Stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through nicotine receptors, increasing phosphorylation of Akt and CREB, and reducing the expression of FoXO1, MuRF-1, and atrogin-1. This enhances the release of acetylcholine, ATP, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), potentially supporting muscle function. It stimulates proliferation in the hippocampus subgranular zone via M1 muscarinic receptors and supports cell survival through α7 nAChRs, involving insulin-like growth factor 2. Clinical studies have shown Galantamine reduces cocaine use frequency at 8 mg/day and improves sustained attention and response inhibition in cigarette smokers, as well as decreasing alcohol consumption in detoxified individuals. The dual mechanism of AChE inhibition and nAChR modulation is central to Galantamine's efficacy in AD. Clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function, with doses ranging from 8–32 mg/day showing benefits over 3–6 months, sustained at 24 mg/day for 12 months. Galantamine is well-absorbed, with linear pharmacokinetics and rapid, complete absorption. About 75% is metabolized in the liver via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with key pathways including O-demethylation, N-demethylation, epimerization, and glucuronidation. Within 24 hours, approximately 20% is excreted unchanged in urine. Summary Table: Key Pharmacological Actions Action Description AChE Inhibition Reversible, competitive, selective; increases ACh levels, IC50 for AChE: 0.35 μM. nAChR Modulation Positive allosteric modulator of α7, α4β2 subtypes; enhances receptor sensitivity at 0.1–1 μM.

    "content": "GB-115 Also known as: Ranquilon, L-Tryptophanamide, N-(1-oxo-6-phenylhexyl)glycyl-, N-6-Phenylhexanoyl-glycyl-L-tryptophan, N-(1-Oxo-6-phenylhexyl)glycyl-L-tryptophanamide, N-phenylhexanoyl-glycyl-L-tryptophan amide Retroanalogue of cholecystokinin-4 (CCK-4). Research indicates GB-115 has significant anxiolytic properties, making it a candidate for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A clinical study involving 31 patients with GAD, diagnosed per ICD-10 (F41.1), determined an effective dose of 6 mg per day. The treatment, administered over 21 days, was associated with a fast onset of anxiolytic effects, beneficial impacts on sleep disturbances, and improvements in autonomic symptoms. Additionally, it favorably altered attention parameters, suggesting cognitive benefits alongside anxiety reduction. In preclinical models, GB-115 demonstrated anxiolytic effects in behavioral tests. For instance, in outbred mice, doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg were effective in the open field test, while in inbred BALB/c mice, doses of 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg showed efficacy. In the elevated plus-maze test, a standard measure of anxiety, GB-115 increased the time spent in open arms in outbred rats at 0.5-0.7 mg/kg and in BALB/c mice at 0.1 mg/kg, indicating reduced anxiety-like behavior ( source ). Further, a study on pharmaceutical compositions of GB-115 found that a controlled-release formulation (composition 4) increased residence time in the elevated plus-maze open arms at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg (p < 0.01) compared to placebo, highlighting its potential for optimized delivery ( source ). GB-115’s impact on cognitive functions is notable, particularly in GAD patients. A study with 25 patients (mean age 35.76 ± 8.55 years) treated with 6 mg/day for 21 days reported significant improvements in cognitive metrics ( source ). The results, summarized in the table below, show enhancements in reaction time, attention parameters, and performance in the Shulte-Platonov tables test: Measure Background Day 3 Day 7 Day 14 Day 21 % Improvement (Day 21 vs Background) Reaction Time (msec) 449.19±64.91 - 418.17±61.49* 422.25±70.69* 406.5±52.79* 9.5% Attention Parameters (msec) 316.41±42.35 305.95±45.31* - - 300.14±47.74* 5.14% Shulte-Platonov Tables (sec) 68.84±16.78 - 59.40±13.71* 57.88±12.82* 53.40±13.19* 22.4% (*p≤0.01 for reaction time and Shulte-Platonov on Days 7, 14, 21; p≤0.05 for attention parameters on Days 3, 21 compared to background). These improvements suggest GB-115 not only mitigates anxiety but also enhances cognitive processing, potentially benefiting patients with GAD-related cognitive deficits. GB-115 exhibits immunocorrecting properties, particularly in animal models. In intact mice, doses of 0.1–10 mg/kg stimulated phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and enhanced humoral immune responses. In mice with secondary immunodeficiency induced by cyclophosphamide, GB-115 demonstrated activity in restoring immune function, suggesting potential applications in conditions involving immune dysregulation ( source ). The anti-inflammatory actions of GB-115 are evident in preclinical models. In studies using ConA- and carrageenan-induced inflammation, intraperitoneal injections at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg reduced inflammatory responses. Notably, at 1 mg/kg, GB-115 alleviated symptoms in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, improving spontaneous locomotor activity, promoting recovery of thymus weight, and reducing edema and neutrophil infiltration in brain tissue. It also suppressed the generation of active oxygen forms by neutrophils, as measured by chemiluminescence, indicating a role in mitigating oxidative stress-related inflammation ( source ). GB-115’s interaction with pain pathways is complex, involving opioidergic systems. In mice, it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia in the hot-plate test, an effect that was naloxone-dependent, suggesting involvement with opioid receptors. However, it did not modulate behavior in the tail-flick test, indicating specificity to certain pain modalities, likely supraspinal mechanisms. Further, research suggests GB-115 (4 mg/kg) increases response latency in the hot-plate test in a naloxone-independent manner, while producing a moderate naloxone-reversible effect in the tail-flick test, pointing to spinal-level opioidergic interactions ( source1 and source2 ). The primary mechanism of GB-115 involves antagonism of CCK2 receptors, which are critical in anxiety and pain modulation. GB-115 is under investigation in clinical trials for anxiety in neurasthenia and adjustment disorders, suggesting broader applications beyond GAD. Its ability to improve cognitive functions, modulate immune responses, and reduce inflammation positions it as a candidate for conditions involving these systems ( source )."

    "title": "Glutamic acid",
    "url": "wiki/alone-glutamic-acid.html",
    "content": "Glutamic acid Neurotransmitter Role: Glutamic acid is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to various glutamate receptors, including ionotropic receptors (e.g., NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Activation of these receptors facilitates neuronal communication by increasing the influx of cations (like calcium and sodium) into neurons, leading to depolarization and signal transmission. This excitatory action is essential for learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. However, excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, a process implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and stroke-related brain damage. Excitotoxicity and Neuroprotection: In pharmacological contexts, glutamic acid's overactivation of receptors (especially NMDA receptors) can cause excessive calcium influx, triggering neuronal injury or death. This is a key mechanism in conditions like epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and ischemia. Drugs targeting glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine) are used to mitigate excitotoxicity in such conditions. Metabolic Functions: Glutamic acid is a precursor to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, via the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This conversion is pharmacologically significant in treatments for anxiety, seizures, and other disorders where GABA modulation is beneficial (e.g., with drugs like benzodiazepines indirectly enhancing GABA activity). It also participates in the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant, which protects cells from oxidative stress—a property exploited in therapies for liver disease and neurodegenerative conditions. Role in Protein Synthesis: As an amino acid, glutamic acid is incorporated into proteins, influencing cellular structure and function. Pharmacologically, this is relevant in nutritional supplements or therapies aimed at muscle repair or metabolic support. Gastrointestinal and Taste Effects: Glutamic acid, often in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG), stimulates umami taste receptors. While not a direct pharmacological action, this property is used in studies of appetite regulation and sensory pharmacology. In the gut, glutamate signaling via receptors may influence digestion and nutrient absorption, an emerging area of pharmacological research. Acid-Base Balance: Glutamic acid contributes to ammonia detoxification in the liver by forming glutamine, a process critical in managing metabolic acidosis or hyperammonemia (e.g., in hepatic encephalopathy). Pharmacological agents enhancing this pathway are sometimes explored in such conditions. Agonists/Antagonists: Drugs targeting glutamate receptors (e.g., ketamine, an NMDA antagonist) are used in anesthesia, depression treatment, and chronic pain management. Neurological Disorders: Modulation of glutamatergic activity is a focus in epilepsy (e.g., lamotrigine reduces glutamate release), multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia research. Nutritional Pharmacology: Glutamic acid supplementation is studied for its potential in muscle recovery and immune function, though evidence is mixed."

    "title": "Glycine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-glycine.html",
    "content": "Glycine Neurotransmitter and Brain Function Glycine is known to function as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, particularly in the spinal cord, where it helps calm nerve activity. This action might help reduce muscle spasms. Additionally, glycine interacts with NMDA receptors in the brain, which are involved in learning and memory, and this interaction is being studied for potential benefits in treating schizophrenia, especially for symptoms like social withdrawal. Therapeutic Uses In medical settings, glycine is used as part of total parenteral nutrition, providing essential nutrients for patients who can’t eat normally. It’s also used as an irrigation solution during certain surgeries, like prostate procedures, due to its non-hemolytic properties. Emerging research suggests glycine may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could be helpful in conditions involving inflammation, though more studies are needed. Unexpected Detail: Stroke Recovery Controversy An unexpected finding is the mixed evidence on glycine’s role in stroke recovery. Some studies suggest it can protect brain cells after an ischemic stroke, potentially improving outcomes, while others indicate high glycine intake might increase stroke mortality risk in certain groups, highlighting a need for careful consideration. Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Glycine’s Pharmacology Actions Glycine, a simple non-essential amino acid, plays a multifaceted role in pharmacology, extending beyond its basic function as a protein building block. Neurotransmitter Actions Glycine is recognized as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, primarily in the brainstem and spinal cord. It binds to strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, which are part of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and include a chloride channel. This binding increases chloride conductance, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and inhibition of activity, which may contribute to its potential antispastic effects. For instance, interference with glycine release, as seen in Clostridium tetani infections, can cause spastic paralysis due to uninhibited muscle contraction, underscoring its role in motor control. Additionally, glycine interacts with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex at a strychnine-insensitive site, acting as a co-agonist. This modulation enhances NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, which is crucial for excitatory signaling in the brain. This property has been explored in psychiatric contexts, particularly for schizophrenia, where supplemental glycine, when taken with some antipsychotic drugs, has shown potential in reducing negative symptoms like social withdrawal in patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. However, the evidence is mixed, with some studies showing no benefit with newer medications like clozapine. Therapeutic Uses and Clinical Applications In clinical pharmacology, glycine is utilized in several practical applications. It is a common component of total parenteral nutrition, providing essential amino acids for patients unable to consume food orally, supporting metabolic needs. Another significant use is as a 1.5% irrigation solution during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), valued for its non-hemolytic properties, though excessive absorption can lead to complications like TUR syndrome, characterized by neurologic symptoms. Emerging research suggests glycine has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially beneficial in conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and various inflammatory disorders. For example, studies indicate glycine can decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve insulin response, possibly through modulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression. These effects are thought to involve glycine’s interaction with neutrophils, reducing oxidant production and protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury, as seen in animal models. Sleep and Neurological Functions Glycine has also been studied for its impact on sleep quality and neurological functions. Research suggests that longer-term administration can improve sleep in healthy populations, potentially by altering body temperature and circadian rhythms, though studies often have small sample sizes and high risk of bias. Its role in enhancing neurological functions, such as memory and mood, is linked to its involvement in serotonin production and nerve signal transmission, though evidence is still developing. Stroke Recovery: A Controversial Area An area of particular interest and controversy is glycine’s role in stroke recovery, specifically in ischemic stroke. Some studies suggest neuroprotective effects, with glycine treatment reducing infarct volume, improving neurologic function scores, and decreasing neuronal and microglial death. For instance, a 2000 trial in Cerebrovasc Dis found that doses of 1.0-2.0 g/day improved outcomes on scales like the Orgogozo Stroke Scale and Barthel Index, potentially through reducing glutamate levels and increasing GABA concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Another study from 2019 highlighted glycine’s ability to inhibit M1 microglial polarization via the NF-κB p65/Hif-1α pathway, suggesting anti-inflammatory benefits in stroke. However, contrasting evidence exists, particularly from dietary intake studies. A 2015 study in the Journal of Nutrition found that high glycine intake was associated with increased risk of mortality from ischemic stroke in men without hypertension, with hazard ratios suggesting a potential risk. Precursor Role and Metabolic Contributions Beyond its direct actions, glycine serves as a precursor for several key metabolites, including glutathione, creatine, heme, purines, and porphyrins. Its role in glutathione synthesis is particularly notable, as glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that protects cells against oxidative stress, potentially reducing inflammation and supporting aging-related health. Creatine, another derivative, is vital for muscle energy, and glycine’s contribution here is explored in athletic supplements. Safety and Considerations While glycine is generally considered safe, its safety profile, especially at high doses, requires further study. Some reports note mild sedation as a side effect, and caution is advised for use in young children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with liver or kidney disease. The quality of glycine supplements varies, and users are encouraged to choose independently tested products and consult healthcare providers.

Activation of GPR55 is associated with several CNS effects, primarily through its signaling pathways involving Gq and G12/13 proteins, which lead to increased intracellular calcium via phospholipase C activation and inhibition of M-type potassium currents. Neuronal Excitation and Neurotransmitter Release: Activation enhances glutamate release in hippocampal slices, suggesting a presynaptic role that increases neuronal excitability Advances in the Physiology of GPR55 in the Central Nervous System . This is mediated by calcium release from intracellular stores, contrasting with the inhibitory effects of CB1/CB2 receptors. Neural Development: GPR55 is implicated in neural development, influencing morphology and axon growth in retinal projections and spinal cord, indicating a role in sensory system maturation [ibid]. Neuroprotection and Inflammation: The effects are dual-edged; in adult rat hippocampus, GPR55 agonists induce microglia-dependent neuroprotection post-excitotoxic lesions, but under certain conditions, activation can promote neuro-inflammation, potentially lowering pain thresholds [ibid]. Pain Modulation: GPR55 activation shows both pronociceptive and antinociceptive effects. For instance, injections of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into the periaqueductal gray induce pronociceptive effects, while palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exhibits pain-killing actions, possibly involving GPR55, with ongoing clinical trials for chronic pain [ibid]. Cognitive and Emotional Effects: Central GPR55 stimulation induces anxiolytic-like effects, blocked by antagonists, which induce anxiety. Alterations in GPR55 expression are linked to autism and anxiety models, suggesting a role in emotional regulation [ibid]. Motor Coordination and Memory: GPR55 knockout mice show impaired motor coordination, and bilateral infusions of CID16020046 in the dorsolateral striatum impair rat performance in the Rotarod test. GPR55 blockade shifts learning curves in T-maze tasks, indicating a role in procedural memory, though motor effects require further investigation [ibid]. Cardiovascular System Effects GPR55's role in the cardiovascular system is less definitive, with conflicting evidence on its impact on blood pressure and cardiac function. Blood Pressure Regulation: Initial hopes linked GPR55 to the hypotensive effects of cannabinoids, but GPR55 knockout mice showed no altered blood pressure regulation after administration of abnormal cannabidiol, suggesting controversy GPR55 - Wikipedia . However, some studies indicate hypotensive effects upon activation GPR55 - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics . Cardiac Function: Research on GPR55 knockout mice revealed reduced contractile reserve in response to dobutamine, indicating a role in cardiac contractility GPR55 EXERTS DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON CARDIAC ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES IN MICE | Heart . This suggests GPR55 may modulate adrenoceptor responsiveness. Atherosclerosis: Activation in macrophages increases lipid accumulation and proinflammatory responses, potentially exacerbating atherosclerosis, as seen with the agonist O-1602 enhancing CD36- and SRB-I-mediated lipid uptake and blocking cholesterol efflux Activation of GPR55 Receptors Exacerbates oxLDL-Induced Lipid Accumulation and Inflammatory Responses | PLOS ONE . Metabolic System Effects GPR55's role in metabolism is increasingly recognized, particularly in energy balance and glucose homeostasis, making it a potential target for metabolic disorders. Insulin Secretion: Activation by agonists like O-1602 and abnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD) increases glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, mediated through inositol trisphosphate-mediated calcium release G-protein coupled receptor 55 agonists increase insulin secretion | ScienceDirect . Studies on isolated mouse and human islets confirm this effect, with GPR55 knockout reducing the response GPR55-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from isolated mouse and human islets of Langerhans | PubMed . Glucose Homeostasis and Adiposity: GPR55 activation improves glucose tolerance in preclinical models, and its deficiency is associated with increased adiposity and impaired insulin signaling in peripheral tissues, suggesting a role in regulating body weight and metabolic health GPR55 deficiency is associated with increased adiposity and impaired insulin signaling | PMC . This is supported by reviews focusing on energy balance GPR55: a new promising target for metabolism? | Journal of Molecular Endocrinology . Gastrointestinal System Effects GPR55's presence in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly on myenteric neurons, suggests a role in gut motility and function. Motility: Activation, particularly with agonists like O-1602, reduces gastrointestinal motility, with significant effects on colonic contractions. For instance, O-1602 concentration-dependently reduced evoked contractions in mouse and human colon muscle strips, an effect reversed by the antagonist cannabidiol (CBD) A role for O-1602 and G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 in the control of colonic motility in mice | PMC . Studies in rodents also show GPR55 ligands influencing GI transit, with implications for conditions like septic ileus A novel CB receptor GPR55 and its ligands are involved in regulation of gut movement in rodents | PubMed . Immune System Effects GPR55's role in the immune system is complex, with evidence for both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions, depending on the context. Inflammation: Some studies suggest anti-inflammatory effects, such as in experimental models of Dravet syndrome and Parkinson's disease where CBD, acting as a GPR55 antagonist, elicited anti-inflammatory responses GPR55 - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics . Conversely, other research indicates a pro-inflammatory role, with GPR55 activation enhancing cytokine production and inflammatory responses in macrophages, as seen in atherosclerosis models Activation of GPR55 Receptors Exacerbates oxLDL-Induced Lipid Accumulation and Inflammatory Responses | PLOS ONE . In a multiple sclerosis model, GPR55 knockout reduced disease severity, suggesting a pro-inflammatory contribution [ibid]. This duality is further highlighted in reviews discussing GPR55 as a potential therapeutic target in inflammation, with context-dependent effects GPR55 – a putative “type 3” cannabinoid receptor in inflammation | De Gruyter Brill . Cancer-Related Effects GPR55's role in cancer is another area of interest, with implications for tumor growth and progression. Tumor Growth: Activation is associated with increased tumor growth in certain cancers, such as glioma, where GPR55 knockdown delayed tumor growth in animal models GPR55 - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics . This is linked to its signaling pathways promoting proliferation and cytoskeletal modulation, making it a potential target for anti-cancer therapeutics [ibid]."

    "content": "Hemp Hemp, from the Cannabis sativa plant, is known for its low THC content and high levels of other compounds like CBD, which contribute to its pharmacological actions. These effects are primarily therapeutic and are being studied for conditions like epilepsy, anxiety, and inflammation. Hemp's key actions include reducing inflammation, helping control seizures, and easing anxiety, thanks to CBD and other cannabinoids. It also shows promise in protecting brain cells, fighting oxidative stress, and relieving pain, though more research is needed to confirm these benefits. Beyond CBD, hemp contains over 545 compounds, including terpenes and flavonoids. Hemp, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is distinguished by its low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, typically below 0.3%. Its pharmacological actions are primarily attributed to a rich profile of bioactive compounds, including cannabinoids (such as cannabidiol [CBD], cannabigerol [CBG], and cannabidiolic acid [CBDA]), terpenes, flavonoids, and other secondary metabolites. Compound Pharmacological Action Mechanism/System Cannabidiol (CBD) Antiepileptic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, reduces trauma-induced anxiety Endocannabinoid system, serotonin system (5-HT1A), TRP channels, GABA-A receptors Cannabidiolic Acid Anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, inhibits COX-2, inhibits cancer cell migration Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, TRP channels Cannabigerol Anti-inflammatory, beneficial for inflammatory bowel disease TRPA1 agonist, cannabinoid receptors Terpenes (e.g., Beta-caryophyllene) Anti-inflammatory, dietary cannabinoid CB2 receptor activation Flavonoids (e.g., Cannflavin A) Antioxidant, neuroprotective, inhibits prostaglandin production Non-specific interactions, antioxidant activity Anti-inflammatory Action CBD, CBDA, CBG, and terpenes like beta-caryophyllene contribute to anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-2 and activating CB2 receptors, which are part of the immune response regulation. Antiepileptic Action CBD is particularly noted for its antiepileptic properties, with FDA approval for treating certain epilepsy types, such as Dravet syndrome. This effect is mediated through interactions with GABA-A receptors and TRP channels. Anxiolytic Action CBD's interaction with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is believed to reduce anxiety, offering potential for mental health applications. Neuroprotective Action Both CBD and flavonoids exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's. This is linked to their antioxidant properties and interactions with the endocannabinoid system. Antioxidant Action Flavonoids and other compounds in hemp, such as cannflavin A, provide antioxidant effects by neutralizing free radicals. Analgesic Action CBD and other cannabinoids may relieve pain by interacting with the endocannabinoid system and pain pathways, offering potential for pain management. Anticancer Potential CBDA has shown preliminary evidence of inhibiting cancer cell migration, suggesting a role in cancer research. Modulation of the Endocannabinoid System Many hemp compounds interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors, influencing mood, pain perception, appetite, and immune function. Nutritional and Additional Pharmacological Considerations Hemp seeds, rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, contribute to cardiovascular health and anti-inflammatory effects, though these are more nutritional than directly pharmacological in the context of bioactive compounds. Essential oils from hemp also exhibit antibacterial and insecticidal properties, which may have therapeutic applications in infection control, though these are less directly relevant to human pharmacology."

    "title": "Histidine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-histidine.html",
    "content": "Histidine Precursor to Histamine: Histidine turns into histamine, a chemical that helps with immune responses (like allergies), stomach acid production, and brain functions like wakefulness. Metal Ion Chelation: Histidine can bind to metals like iron and copper, which is important for enzyme activity and protecting against metal-related damage. Antioxidant Activity: It fights off harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage, especially through a derivative called carnosine. Part of Active Peptides: Histidine is found in peptides like carnosine, which help with muscle pH balance and have antioxidant effects. Research suggests Histidine might help with conditions like metabolic syndrome, heart diseases, and inflammation, but these areas are still being studied, so we don’t have definitive answers yet. An unexpected detail is that it’s used in solutions for organ preservation, which is not something most people associate with amino acids. Histidine (HIS) is one of the nine essential amino acids that humans must obtain from their diet, found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and beans. Its unique imidazole side chain, with pKa values around physiological pH, gives it distinctive chemical properties, making it a versatile player in biological systems. Pharmacological Actions Precursor to Histamine Histidine is decarboxylated by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase to form histamine, a critical mediator in multiple systems. Immune Response: Histamine is involved in allergic reactions, released from basophils and mast cells, causing symptoms like itching, swelling, and increased vascular permeability. It is treatable with antihistamines for conditions such as urticaria, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, and in severe cases like anaphylaxis, epinephrine is used. Gastric Acid Secretion: Histamine binds to H2 receptors on parietal cells, triggering hydrochloric acid release via proton pump activation, essential for digestion. Neurotransmission: In the brain, histamine modulates appetite, wakefulness, and emotions, with dysregulation linked to conditions like Tourette Syndrome, where mutations in the histidine decarboxylase gene and H3 receptor activity are implicated. No reported allergic reactions or peptic ulcers have been associated with increased Histidine intake, suggesting safety in typical supplementation. Precursor to Histamine The imidazole ring of Histidine, with pKa values of 6.2 and 6.5 for free L-HIS, 7.0 in carnosine, and 7.1 in anserine, acts as an effective pH buffer near physiological conditions. This property is clinically utilized in organ preservation solutions, such as the histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution, containing 198 mM Histidine, and in myocardial protection during cardiac surgery, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular pH during stress. Metal Ion Chelation Histidine forms complexes with metal ions such as Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺, binding iron in haemoglobin and myoglobin, and is present in metalloenzymes like carbonic anhydrase and cytochromes. This chelation is crucial for enzyme function and protects against metal-induced neurotoxicity, with carnosine (CAR) specifically noted for protecting against copper- and zinc-induced damage. Antioxidant Activity Histidine mediates antioxidant effects through metal chelation, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and sequestering advanced glycation end products (AGE) and lipoxidation end products (ALE). Carnosine is particularly effective, more so than free Histidine, in combating oxidative stress, with studies showing protective roles in conditions like chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Component of Biologically Active Peptides Histidine is integral to histidine-rich proteins (e.g., haemoproteins, histatins, histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, filaggrin) and dipeptides like carnosine and homocarnosine. These peptides have specific functions: carnosine maintains pH buffering in muscle tissue, combating intramuscular acidosis, and exhibits antibacterial activity, while histatins contribute to immunity. Therapeutic Potential and Clinical Studies Metabolic Syndrome and Inflammation: A 2013 study improved insulin resistance in obese women with metabolic syndrome by suppressing inflammation. Another 2014 study alleviated inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet-induced obese rats via NF-κB- and PPARγ-involved pathways. Cardiovascular Protection: Histidine prevented brain infarction in postischemic rats (2005 study) and, in combination with vitamin C, protected against isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction in rats (2016). It also mitigated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats when combined with N-acetylcysteine (2014). Diabetes and Oxidative Stress: A 2005 study delayed diabetic deterioration in mice and protected human low-density lipoprotein against oxidation and glycation, while a 2018 study highlighted its protective role against oxidative stress in anemia of chronic kidney disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A 2009 study ameliorated murine colitis by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages. Safety and Dosing Histidine supplements are considered possibly safe when taken short-term, up to 4 grams daily for up to 12 weeks, and are well-tolerated. Precautions include avoiding use in folic acid deficiency due to potential formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU) buildup, and insufficient reliable information exists for safety in larger amounts during pregnancy or breastfeeding, recommending sticking to dietary amounts. Pharmacological Action Details pH Buffering Used in organ preservation (e.g., 198 mM in HTK solution), myocardial protection in surgery. Metal Ion Chelation Binds Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, protects against neurotoxicity, essential for metalloenzymes. Antioxidant Activity Scavenges ROS/RNS, carnosine more effective, protects in diabetes, kidney disease. Histamine Precursor Affects immune cells, gastric acid, brain functions, no adverse reactions reported. Role in Peptides Carnosine buffers muscle pH, histatins provide immunity, antibacterial activity."

    "title": "Homotaurine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-homotaurine.html",
    "content": "Homotaurine Homotaurine, also known as Tramiprosate, is a sulfonic acid compound found naturally in seaweed and has been extensively studied for its potential therapeutic effects, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This survey note provides a detailed examination of its pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, dosage regimens, and safety profile, drawing from a wide range of scientific literature and clinical trial data available as of May 29, 2025. Pharmacological Actions Tramiprosate exhibits a multifaceted pharmacological profile, primarily targeting mechanisms implicated in AD pathology. The key actions include: Inhibition of Amyloid-β (Aβ) Aggregation: Tramiprosate binds to soluble Aβ, particularly at residues Lys16, Lys28, and Asp23, stabilizing monomers and reducing the formation of toxic oligomers and fibrillar plaques. This action is crucial as Aβ aggregation is a hallmark of AD, contributing to neuronal damage. Preclinical studies in transgenic mice have shown reduced plaque burden and decreased CSF Aβ levels, supporting its potential as a disease-modifying agent. ( source ) GABAergic Activity: Structurally similar to γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), Tramiprosate acts as a functional agonist at GABA-A receptors, which may contribute to its neuroprotective effects. This activity is thought to modulate neuronal excitability and provide protection against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity ( source ). It also reduces caspase 3/7 and 9 activities in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, suggesting a GABA-dependent neuroprotective mechanism. ( source ) Anti-inflammatory Effects: Clinical studies, particularly in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, have demonstrated reduced levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-18, indicating an anti-inflammatory role ( source ). This action may mitigate the inflammatory component of AD pathology. Neuroprotection: Beyond GABA-dependent pathways, Tramiprosate inhibits Aβ42-induced ERK1/2 activation through a GABA-independent mechanism, further enhancing its neuroprotective profile ( source ). This dual mechanism suggests broad protective effects against neuronal damage. Promotion of Tau Polymerization: Interestingly, Tramiprosate promotes the polymerization of tau into non-toxic aggregates without affecting tau-microtubule binding, potentially reducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another AD hallmark. ( source ) The time course of these actions is not fully detailed in the literature, but clinical studies indicate that effects on biomarkers like CSF Aβ levels are observable after three months of treatment, suggesting a gradual onset. ( source ) Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data for Tramiprosate are primarily derived from studies involving its prodrug, ALZ-801, due to its improved pharmacokinetic profile. Key parameters include: Half-life: Studies with ALZ-801 suggest a half-life for Tramiprosate of approximately 15-18 hours. For instance, a 2025 study reported a terminal phase elimination half-life of about 14.8 hours, while a 2018 study indicated around 18 hours ( Clinical Pharmacokinetics: Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Oral ALZ-801 , PubMed: Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Safety of ALZ-801 ). Bioavailability: Specific oral bioavailability for Tramiprosate is not directly available, but for ALZ-801, an estimated oral bioavailability of approximately 52% was reported in a 2018 study, suggesting efficient absorption and conversion to active moieties ( source ). Given ALZ-801's design to improve upon Tramiprosate's pharmacokinetics, the bioavailability of Tramiprosate itself may be lower, but exact figures are lacking. Metabolism and Excretion: Tramiprosate is metabolized to 3-sulfopropanoic acid (3-SPA), an endogenous metabolite with anti-Aβ activity, and is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with plasma exposures inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( source ). Dosage Regimens Range of Doses Tested: Doses in clinical studies ranged from 50 mg to 150 mg twice daily (BID). For example, a phase II study randomized patients to 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg BID for three months, with an open-label extension at 150 mg BID for 17 months ( source ). Phase III trials, such as the Alphase Study, used 100 mg and 150 mg BID for 78 weeks ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose appears to be around 100 mg BID, as this dose showed a dose-dependent reduction in CSF Aβ42 levels in phase II studies, suggesting therapeutic activity ( source ). Lower doses like 50 mg BID showed less pronounced effects. Maximum Safe Dose: The maximum tested dose in humans is 150 mg BID, which was generally well-tolerated, with adverse events primarily gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, leading to discontinuation in about 3.6% of patients ( source ). No amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) were observed, indicating a favorable safety profile at this dose. LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: Specific LD50 values for Homotaurine are not publicly available in the literature reviewed. Preclinical toxicology data are sparse, with studies focusing more on efficacy and safety in animal models rather than acute toxicity. Given its use in clinical trials at doses up to 150 mg BID without serious adverse events, it is considered safe at therapeutic levels, but higher doses have not been tested in humans, making the toxicity threshold unclear ( source ). Safety Profile Common Adverse Effects: The most frequent adverse events are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, which are dose-dependent but not significantly different from placebo at 100 mg BID ( source ). Syncope was also reported in some cases. Mortality and Serious Events: In the Alphase Study, mortality rates were 4.0% for placebo, 2.8% for 100 mg BID, and 2.3% for 150 mg BID, with no significant difference, suggesting no increased risk at therapeutic doses ( source ). Subgroup Safety: APOE4 carriers, particularly homozygotes, showed a similar safety profile, with no increased incidence of vasogenic edema compared to non-carriers ( source ). Given the lack of LD50 data and the focus on chronic safety in elderly patients, the point at which Tramiprosate becomes dangerously toxic is not established, but clinical data suggest it remains safe within the tested range of 50-150 mg BID. Summary Table of Key Parameters Parameter Details Half-life Approximately 15-18 hours (from ALZ-801 studies) Oral Bioavailability Estimated ~52% (from ALZ-801, exact for Tramiprosate not specified) Minimum Effective Dose Likely 100 mg BID, based on CSF Aβ42 reduction Maximum Safe Dose 150 mg BID, well-tolerated with gastrointestinal side effects LD50 Not publicly available, safety established at therapeutic doses Common Side Effects Nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dose-dependent"

    "title": "Imiquimod",
    "url": "wiki/alone-imiquimod.html",
    "content": "Imiquimod Pharmacological Actions Imiquimod is classified as an immune response modifier, specifically acting as a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. This action stimulates the innate immune system by activating immune cells, leading to the production of cytokines such as interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factors. This immune activation is crucial for its therapeutic effects in treating conditions like external genital and perianal warts (EGW), actinic keratoses (AK), and superficial basal cell carcinoma. While the exact mechanism for AK and EGW is not fully elucidated, it is associated with increased markers of cytokines and immune cells upon topical application, with no direct antiviral activity observed in cell culture for EGW. The immune response is thought to help eliminate abnormal skin cells and viral infections, making it effective for these dermatological conditions. The time course of these pharmacological actions is influenced by the drug's pharmacokinetics, particularly its prolonged retention in the skin when applied topically. This sustained presence, with an apparent half-life of 24-29 hours, suggests a gradual release and prolonged immune activation, which is beneficial for local treatment but may contribute to local skin reactions over time. Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability The pharmacokinetics of Imiquimod vary significantly between topical and oral routes, reflecting its primary use as a topical agent. Topical Application: Absorption: Systemic absorption is minimal, with mean peak serum concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/mL to 3.5 ng/mL depending on the dose and application area (e.g., face, scalp, hands/arms). Urinary recovery data indicate systemic absorption is less than 1%, with recovery rates of 0.08% to 2.41% of the applied dose, suggesting very low bioavailability into the bloodstream. Half-life: The apparent half-life is approximately 24-29 hours, significantly longer than subcutaneous dosing (2 hours), due to prolonged retention in the skin. This prolonged half-life supports its efficacy for local immune activation over extended periods. Steady-state: Achieved by Day 7 with once-daily dosing, indicating a build-up effect over the initial treatment phase. Topical Application: Bioavailability: Research from a clinical study indicates an oral bioavailability of 47% relative to subcutaneous administration, with no significant effect from food intake on absorption rate or extent. This suggests it can be administered orally in fasted or non-fasted states, though this is not a standard route. Absorption Half-life: Approximately 1 hour, with Tmax around 2.6 hours in fasted states and 3.6 hours in non-fasted states, showing a slight delay with food. Elimination Half-life: About 2.5 hours, with total body clearance around 970 ml/h×kg, indicating rapid systemic clearance compared to topical use. Dose and Study Context: The study involved a 100 mg oral dose, significantly higher than typical topical doses, highlighting its experimental nature for oral use. The difference in bioavailability and half-life between routes underscores Imiquimod's design for topical application, where local effects are prioritized over systemic exposure. Dosage and Administration Imiquimod is available as a 3.75% cream for topical use, with specific dosing regimens based on the condition: Actinic Keratosis (AK): Apply a thin layer (0.5 grams, equivalent to 18.75 mg Imiquimod) once daily at bedtime to the affected area (face or balding scalp) for two 2-week treatment cycles, separated by a 2-week no-treatment period. Leave on for about 8 hours, then remove with mild soap and water. Dosage interruption may be necessary for local skin reactions, but cycles should not be extended. External Genital Warts (EGW): Apply a thin layer (0.25 grams, equivalent to 9.375 mg Imiquimod) once daily at bedtime until total clearance or for up to 8 weeks, leave on for about 8 hours, then remove. Dosage interruption may be needed for local skin reactions. General Notes: Not for oral, ophthalmic, intra-anal, or intravaginal use. Prescribe no more than 2 boxes (56 packets) or two 7.5 g bottle pumps per treatment course to limit exposure. Safety Profile and Toxicity The safety range is defined by adherence to prescribed doses, with exceeding these increasing the risk of adverse reactions. The minimum effective dose aligns with the prescribed regimens, as lower doses may not achieve therapeutic efficacy. The maximum dose without high risks is the prescribed amount, as higher doses can lead to severe local skin reactions and potential systemic effects. Adverse Reactions: Common side effects include local skin reactions (erythema, scabbing, flaking, edema, erosion, exudate), headache, application site pain, irritation, pruritus, fatigue, influenza-like illness, and nausea, reported in ≥4% of patients. Postmarketing reports include application site tingling, angioedema, cardiovascular events, endocrine disorders, hematological decreases, hepatic issues, infections, musculoskeletal pain, neuropsychiatric events, respiratory issues, urinary retention, skin changes, and vascular events. Overdosage: Topical overdosage can increase severe local skin reactions. Oral ingestion of doses >200 mg has been associated with hypotension in clinical trials, indicating a threshold for systemic toxicity. For management, contact the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%): From animal toxicity studies, the following LD50 values were observed: Oral: 1665 mg/kg in rats, 200 mg/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys. Intravenous: 6-8 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal: 763 mg/kg in rats, 879 mg/kg in mice. Subcutaneous: 20 mg/kg in rats. These values are from preclinical studies and not directly applicable to humans, but they provide insight into potential toxicity thresholds, especially for accidental ingestion. When It Becomes Too Dangerous: For topical use, exceeding recommended doses can lead to severe local skin reactions, potentially requiring dosage interruption. For oral ingestion, doses above 200 mg are concerning, with hypotension reported, suggesting a point where systemic effects become significant."

    "content": "Inosine Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor."

    "url": "wiki/alone-inositol.html",
    "content": "Inositol Pharmacological Actions Cellular Signaling: Inositol is a critical component of the phosphoinositide cycle, serving as a second messenger in intracellular signal transduction pathways. It facilitates communication within cells, influencing processes like hormone response and growth factor signaling ( source ). Insulin Sensitization: It enhances insulin sensitivity, which is particularly beneficial for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and metabolic syndrome. Studies suggest it improves insulin action, potentially reducing blood glucose levels and aiding in conditions associated with insulin resistance ( source ). Neurotransmitter Modulation: Inositol influences neurotransmitter synthesis, notably serotonin, which impacts mood and mental health. It has been explored for treating depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with evidence suggesting it modulates neurotransmitter activity in the brain ( source ). Osmoregulation: In the brain, Inositol acts as an osmolyte, helping maintain cell volume and fluid balance, which is crucial for neurological function. Its concentration is notably high in brain tissue, supporting osmoregulation ( source ). Structural Role: As phosphatidylinositol, it is a structural component of cell membranes, contributing to membrane integrity and function ( source ). The onset of clinical effects for these actions varies, with research indicating that therapeutic benefits, particularly for mental health and metabolic conditions, are typically observed within 2-4 weeks ( source ). This timeline aligns with the need for sustained supplementation to achieve significant physiological changes, especially for chronic conditions. Pharmacokinetics Half-Life: Studies in preterm infants report a half-life of approximately 5-8 hours, with specific values ranging from 5.22 hours to 7.90 hours ( source ). Bioavailability: Inositol is absorbed from the small intestine, with oral ingestion leading to peak plasma concentrations around 4 hours post-dose, indicating good oral bioavailability ( source ). Dosage and Safety Therapeutic Doses: For mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, doses typically range from 12-18 g/day, often taken in divided doses ( source ). Safe Range and Side Effects: Inositol is generally considered safe up to 18 g/day, with side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and gas reported at doses above 12 g/day ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition, with research suggesting 1-2 g/day as effective for some metabolic benefits, while higher doses are needed for mental health, starting at 12 g/day ( source ). Maximum Safe Dose: Not explicitly defined, but studies using doses up to 18 g/day for extended periods (e.g., 3 months) report no significant adverse effects, indicating a high safety margin ( source ). LD50 and Toxicity: In rats, the LD50 is reported as 10 g/kg body weight orally, indicating very low toxicity ( source ). For a 70 kg human, this translates to 700 g, far exceeding typical therapeutic doses, suggesting minimal risk of toxicity at recommended levels. Dangerous Doses: Given the high LD50 and lack of reported serious toxicity, dangerous levels likely exceed 18 g/day, but specific thresholds are not established. Side effects at higher doses are mild, suggesting a wide therapeutic window, though caution is advised above 18 g/day due to potential mineral absorption issues at very high doses ( source ). Condition Therapeutic Dose (g/day) Minimum Effective Dose (g/day) Notes Mental Health (e.g., Depression, Anxiety) 12-18 12 Effects seen in 2-4 weeks PCOS and Metabolic Syndrome 2-4 1-2 Often combined with folic acid Gestational Diabetes 4 (2 g twice daily with folic acid) 2 Prevents onset, used during pregnancy"

    "content": "Isoleucine Studies indicate Isoleucine can strengthen the immune system, particularly by helping produce β-defensins, which are peptides that fight off infections and support both innate and adaptive immunity. Isoleucine is crucial for making muscle proteins, which helps with muscle growth and recovery after exercise. It also seems to help with how our muscles use glucose, potentially aiding energy levels and reducing muscle soreness post-workout. There's evidence suggesting Isoleucine helps muscles take in glucose and break it down for energy, which might help manage blood sugar levels. Enhances immune function by inducing the expression of host defense peptides, specifically β-defensins. Reduces post-exercise muscle soreness and markers of muscle damage when taken as part of BCAAs, though it is less effective than Leucine. Muscle Growth & Recovery Essential for muscle protein synthesis, reduces post-exercise muscle soreness and damage when part of BCAAs, but less effective than leucine. Optimal synthesis requires all nine essential amino acids. Glucose Metabolism Enhances glucose uptake by muscle cells, increases glucose breakdown into energy, reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis in rodents. Rat dosages of 0.3–0.45 mg/kg effective for reducing blood glucose, extrapolated to human dose of 48–72 mg/kg (3.3–4.9 g for 150 lb person). Inconsistent human trial results. Other Functions Acts as a signaling molecule, regulates protein, glucose, lipid metabolism, glucose transport, and immune function. Potential Negative Associations Increased blood levels associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity in observational studies. Cause-effect unclear. Side Effects Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea) when taken as part of BCAAs. Side effects of isoleucine alone undetermined. Recommended Intake RDA: 19 mg/kg bodyweight daily. No strong evidence for supplementing isoleucine alone above RDA."

    "title": "Itraconazole",
    "url": "wiki/alone-itraconazole.html",
    "content": "Itraconazole Pharmacological Actions Itraconazole belongs to the triazole class of antifungals and exerts its primary pharmacological action by inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP51) essential for ergosterol synthesis in fungal cells. Ergosterol is a critical component of fungal cell membranes, and its depletion leads to increased membrane permeability, accumulation of toxic sterols, and disruption of membrane integrity, ultimately inhibiting fungal growth. This mechanism is effective against a range of fungal infections, including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and onychomycosis. Additionally, itraconazole has an active metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, which contributes to its antifungal activity, enhancing its efficacy in systemic infections. The time course of these actions is influenced by the drug’s pharmacokinetics, with antifungal effects typically observed within days to weeks, depending on the infection site and severity. For example, superficial infections like oral candidiasis may show improvement within 1-2 weeks, while deeper infections like onychomycosis may require several months for complete resolution due to the time needed for nail regrowth. Half-Life The half-life of itraconazole varies depending on the dosing regimen and patient factors. After a single dose, the terminal half-life ranges from 16 to 28 hours, reflecting initial distribution and elimination phases. With repeated dosing, due to non-linear pharmacokinetics and accumulation, the half-life extends to 34 to 42 hours, as steady-state concentrations are typically reached within about 15 days. This prolonged half-life is particularly relevant for chronic therapy, ensuring sustained antifungal activity. In special populations, the half-life can be affected by renal and hepatic function. For instance, in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (CrCl 50-79 mL/min, 20-49 mL/min, and <20 mL/min), mean terminal half-lives are 42-49 hours, similar to healthy subjects at 48 hours. In cirrhotic patients, after a single 100 mg dose, the elimination half-life increases to 37 ± 17 hours compared to 16 ± 5 hours in healthy subjects, indicating slower clearance in liver dysfunction. Bioavailabilities Bioavailability, the fraction of the administered dose that reaches systemic circulation, varies by formulation. For oral capsules, the observed absolute bioavailability is approximately 55%, with maximal absorption achieved when taken immediately after a full meal, as gastric acidity enhances dissolution. Absorption is reduced in conditions with decreased gastric acidity, such as with concurrent use of H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors, and can be improved under fasted conditions with an acidic beverage like non-diet cola after ranitidine pretreatment. The oral solution, formulated with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to improve solubility, exhibits higher bioavailability. Studies indicate that the area under the curve (AUC) for the oral solution is 30-33% higher for itraconazole and 35-37% higher for hydroxyitraconazole compared to capsules, suggesting an estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 71.5% for the solution, based on the capsule’s 55% baseline. This enhancement is attributed to better absorption, particularly in the small intestine, reducing variability seen with capsules due to intestinal epithelial damage or varying gastric environments. Notably, capsules and oral solution are not bioequivalent, and switching between formulations requires medical guidance. Intravenous administration, while not commonly discussed in the context of oral routes, has 100% bioavailability by definition, but is less frequently used due to availability and cost considerations. Dosages Dosage regimens for itraconazole are tailored to the infection type, severity, and patient factors, with specific guidelines as follows: Onychomycosis (Toenails with or without Fingernail Involvement): 200 mg orally once daily for 12 consecutive weeks, taken with a full meal. Onychomycosis (Fingernails Only): Two treatment pulses, each consisting of 200 mg twice daily (400 mg/day) for 1 week, separated by a 3-week drug-free period. Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: 200 mg once daily (2 capsules), increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily if no improvement, with doses above 200 mg/day divided into two doses, taken with food. Aspergillosis: 200 to 400 mg daily, with a loading dose of 200 mg three times daily (600 mg/day) for the first 3 days in life-threatening situations, continued for a minimum of 3 months. Candidiasis (Oropharyngeal): 20 mL oral solution (200 mg) once daily for 1-2 weeks, swish and swallow, or 10 mL twice daily for 2-4 weeks. Candidiasis (Esophageal): 20 mL oral solution twice daily for 14-21 days. Off-label Uses: For cutaneous or lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, 200 mg daily, potentially increased to 200 mg twice daily, continued until 2-4 weeks after lesion resolution, preferring oral solution. For renal impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min), reduce the dose by 50%; in hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, dose at 100 mg every 12-24 hours without supplementation. Hepatic dosing is undefined, with caution advised due to potential hepatotoxicity. The minimum effective dose is generally 200 mg daily for most indications, reflecting the starting dose for systemic infections. The maximum dose without high risks is typically 400 mg/day, with 600 mg/day used as a loading dose in severe cases under close monitoring. Higher doses, particularly prolonged, increase the risk of adverse effects, as discussed below. Safety, LD50, and Toxicity Thresholds The safe dosage range is up to 400 mg/day for most patients, with higher doses (up to 600 mg/day) used short-term in life-threatening infections under medical supervision. The minimum effective dose, as noted, is 200 mg daily, ensuring therapeutic levels for most fungal infections. The LD50, or lethal dose for 50% of test subjects, in rats is greater than 320 mg/kg orally and 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally, providing animal toxicity data. However, human LD50 is not ethically determined, and toxicity in humans is monitored through clinical parameters. Toxicity becomes a concern at trough levels above 3 mcg/mL, with risks of hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity can manifest as elevated liver enzymes, potentially reversible upon discontinuation, with recovery typically within 6-12 weeks, though rare cases of severe liver failure have been reported. Cardiotoxicity, including congestive heart failure, is noted, particularly at doses above 400 mg/day, with a black-box warning for new or worsening heart failure. Symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling, and rapid heartbeat, necessitating immediate discontinuation and medical evaluation. The point at which itraconazole becomes too dangerous is when these serious adverse effects appear, often linked to prolonged high doses or pre-existing liver/heart conditions. Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline and periodically, especially beyond one month of therapy, is recommended, along with drug concentration monitoring to ensure trough levels remain below 3 mcg/mL. There is no specific antidote for itraconazole overdose, and management is supportive, focusing on symptom control and discontinuation."

    "title": "Ivermectin",
    "url": "wiki/alone-ivermectin.html",
    "content": "Ivermectin Pharmacological Actions Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic agent primarily indicated for treating infections such as onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies. Its mechanism of action involves binding selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate muscle and nerve cells, particularly in microfilaria. This binding increases permeability to chloride ions, leading to hyperpolarization, paralysis, and death of the parasite. Additionally, Ivermectin acts as an agonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), disrupting central nervous system neurosynaptic transmission in parasites, which further contributes to its efficacy. Recent studies, such as those published in Ivermectin: A Multifaceted Drug With a Potential Beyond Anti-parasitic Therapy , suggest emerging roles in anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and even anti-cancer activities, though these are less established and require further research, especially for human applications. The time course of these actions is influenced by pharmacokinetics. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically reached around 4 hours post-oral administration, with effects on parasites beginning shortly thereafter, as evidenced by studies in The Pharmacokinetics and Interactions of Ivermectin in Humans—A Mini-review . The duration of action aligns with its half-life, ensuring sustained activity against parasites over approximately 18 hours. Pharmacokinetics Half-Life: The elimination half-life of Ivermectin following oral administration is approximately 18 hours, as detailed in Ivermectin: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online . This indicates that it takes about 18 hours for the plasma concentration to reduce by half, influencing dosing intervals for repeated treatments. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is moderate and can be enhanced with a high-fat meal, improving absorption. Specific percentages are not universally reported, but studies indicate variability. For instance, an oral solution (ethanolic) has been shown to have approximately twice the systemic availability compared to tablets or capsules, as noted in The Pharmacokinetics and Interactions of Ivermectin in Humans—A Mini-review . Factors such as co-administration with beverages like beer can increase plasma levels, while orange juice may decrease bioavailability, highlighting the importance of administration conditions. Other routes, such as topical, are used for conditions like rosacea, but bioavailability data for these are less relevant to the oral focus here. The drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier significantly, with a volume of distribution of 3 to 3.5 L/kg, and is 93% protein-bound, primarily metabolized hepatically and excreted in feces (>99%). Dosage Considerations Dosages vary based on the condition and patient weight, with detailed guidelines provided in clinical resources like Medscape: Stromectol (ivermectin) dosing . Below is a table summarizing key dosage information: Condition Typical Dose (Adults, Oral) Notes Strongyloidiasis 200 μg/kg (e.g., 15 mg for >80 kg) once Repeat doses not usually necessary; verify eradication with stool exams Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) 150 μg/kg (e.g., 12 mg for 80 kg) once, may repeat in 3-12 months Does not treat adult worms, which may require surgical excision Scabies (Immunocompromised, Off-label) 200 μg/kg once, may repeat in 14 days Higher doses for severe cases under medical supervision Therapeutic Range: The standard therapeutic dose is 150-200 μg/kg, translating to approximately 10.5-14 mg for a 70 kg individual, administered as a single dose for most indications. Minimum Effective Dose: For onchocerciasis, the minimum effective dose is around 150 μg/kg, ensuring sufficient plasma levels to paralyze microfilaria, as supported by INCHEM: Ivermectin . Maximum Safe Dose: Typically, single doses up to 200 μg/kg are considered safe, with clinical experience showing 9% adverse effects at 150 μg/kg, mostly Mazzotti-type reactions (e.g., edema, pruritis), and 0.25% severe, as per INCHEM: Ivermectin . Higher or repeated doses, such as in crusted scabies, may reach up to seven doses over a month, but this is under strict medical supervision. LD50 and Toxicity: The LD50, or lethal dose for 50% of subjects, is estimated at 2-43 mg/kg in humans, extrapolated from animal studies (e.g., mice LD50 oral 25 mg/kg, dogs 80 mg/kg, rats around 50 mg/kg subcutaneously, as per Comparative evaluation of acute toxicity of ivermectin by two methods after single subcutaneous administration in rats - PubMed and Ivermectin - Wikipedia ). This indicates a wide margin of safety at therapeutic doses, with the therapeutic range (0.15-0.2 mg/kg) being significantly lower. When It Becomes Dangerous: Case reports suggest toxicity symptoms, such as mydriasis, vomiting, and neurological effects, at doses around 5-10 mg/kg. For example, a 16-month-old boy ingesting 100-130 mg (approximately 6.7-8.7 mg/kg for 15 kg) experienced symptoms but recovered, as noted in INCHEM: Ivermectin . Higher doses, such as those reported in overdose cases (e.g., up to 125 mg in veterinary formulations, potentially 1.8 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult), can lead to severe effects like coma, as per Toxic Effects from Ivermectin Use Associated with Prevention and Treatment of Covid-19 | New England Journal of Medicine . The evidence leans toward doses above 7 mg/kg being considered toxic, especially for off-label uses like COVID-19, where achieving anti-viral effects in vitro required such high doses, as mentioned in Ivermectin - Wikipedia . The controversy around Ivermectin, particularly its off-label use for COVID-19, has led to increased reports of toxicity, with the FDA and CDC issuing warnings about overdoses, as seen in Ivermectin toxicity, treatment: Self-medicating COVID-19 danger . This highlights the importance of adhering to approved indications and dosages, with therapeutic levels being well-tolerated in non-infected individuals, while higher doses in infected patients may exacerbate adverse reactions due to parasite die-off. In summary, Ivermectin’s pharmacological actions are well-established for parasitic treatment, with clear pharmacokinetic profiles and dosage guidelines. However, caution is advised at doses exceeding therapeutic ranges, with toxicity thresholds identified around 5-10 mg/kg, and severe risks at higher levels, particularly in non-approved uses. Positive Impacts by Condition Ivermectin has shown effectiveness across several parasitic infections, with specific percentages from clinical studies: Onchocerciasis (River Blindness): Reduces skin microfilariae by 98-99% after 1-2 months and decreases female worms with live microfilariae by about 70%. Lymphatic Filariasis: Achieves 100% microfilarial clearance at day 12, with levels at 18-20% of pretreatment at 6 months. Strongyloidiasis: Offers a 96.8% cure rate with a single dose, increasing to 98% with two doses. Scabies: Provides a 62.4% cure rate with one dose, rising to 92.8% with two doses, and up to 100% in some studies with appropriate dosing. Head Lice: Shows a 95.2% efficacy rate in difficult-to-treat cases with oral administration. Safety and Convenience Ivermectin is generally safe, with adverse reactions occurring in 6-13 per 1000 people for onchocerciasis initially, decreasing with subsequent doses. Its single-dose oral administration improves compliance, especially in resource-limited settings. Pharmacological Actions Ivermectin works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in parasites, causing paralysis and death. It’s selective for parasites, ensuring safety in humans, and also prevents adult female worms from releasing microfilariae in conditions like onchocerciasis. Detailed Side Effects with Percentages Below, side effects are categorized by system, with percentages from various sources, including the Stromectol prescribing information for strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, and a COVID-19 trial (JAMA, 2021, at 400 μg/kg dose). Post-marketing reports are included where percentages are not available. Neurological Side Effects These are linked to Ivermectin’s potential CNS effects, especially at higher doses: Dizziness: 2.8% (strongyloidiasis), 34.0% (COVID-19 trial) Somnolence: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Vertigo: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Tremor: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis), 6.5% (COVID-19 trial) Headache: 0.2% (onchocerciasis), 52.0% (COVID-19 trial) Confusion, ataxia, seizures: Reported in overdose or misuse cases, frequencies not quantified. Gastrointestinal Side Effects Often mild and transient, possibly due to direct irritation: Diarrhea: 1.8% (strongyloidiasis), 26.0% (COVID-19 trial) Nausea: 1.8% (strongyloidiasis), 23.0% (COVID-19 trial) Vomiting: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis), 1.5% (COVID-19 trial) Abdominal pain: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis), 18.0% (COVID-19 trial) Anorexia: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Constipation: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Dermatological Side Effects Linked to immune responses, especially in onchocerciasis: Pruritus: 2.8% (strongyloidiasis), 27.5% (onchocerciasis) Rash: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis), 6.0% (COVID-19 trial) Urticaria: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Skin involvement (edema, papular/pustular rash): 22.7% (onchocerciasis) Skin discoloration: 6.5% (COVID-19 trial) Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome: Post-marketing reports, frequencies not quantified. Musculoskeletal Side Effects Often part of the Mazzotti reaction in onchocerciasis: Arthralgia/synovitis: 9.3% (onchocerciasis) Myalgia: 0.4% (onchocerciasis) Lymphatic Side Effects Common in onchocerciasis due to immune response: Lymph node enlargement and tenderness: Various, e.g., inguinal lymph node enlargement 12.6%, tenderness 13.9% (onchocerciasis) Cardiovascular Side Effects Linked to systemic effects, possibly dose-related: Tachycardia: 3.5% (onchocerciasis) Orthostatic hypotension: 1.1% (onchocerciasis) Hypotension: Post-marketing reports, frequencies not quantified. Ophthalmological Side Effects Noted in both standard and high-dose uses, transient in many cases: Disturbances of vision: 16.5% (COVID-19 trial) Blurry vision: 11.5% (COVID-19 trial) Photophobia: 3.5% (COVID-19 trial) Reduction in visual acuity: 2.0% (COVID-19 trial) Conjunctival hemorrhage: Post-marketing reports, frequencies not quantified. General Side Effects Non-specific, often mild: Asthenia/fatigue: 0.9% (strongyloidiasis) Fever: 22.6% (onchocerciasis) Edema: Facial 1.2%, peripheral 3.2% (onchocerciasis) Swelling: 2.0% (COVID-19 trial) Respiratory and Hepatic Side Effects Rare but serious, often from post-marketing data: Worsening of bronchial asthma: Post-marketing reports Hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, elevation of bilirubin: Post-marketing reports, frequencies not quantified. Other Side Effects Severe and rare, linked to neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity: Somnolence/drowsiness, stupor, coma, confusion, disorientation, death (post-marketing reports) Impact in Medical Contexts: Bacterial Biofilms In medical settings, the focus shifts to bacterial biofilms, which are implicated in chronic infections and are notoriously resistant to antibiotics. Research here has yielded mixed results, with Ivermectin's effectiveness varying based on the bacterial strain, concentration, and whether it is used alone or in combination: A study published in PubMed (2021) investigated the antimicrobial and biofilm properties of Ivermectin and its derivative, D4, against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Ivermectin was 20 μg/mL, while D4 had a lower MIC of 5 μg/mL, indicating greater potency. However, the impact on biofilms was starkly different: Ivermectin showed no significant change in biofilm formation at 40 μg/mL after 24 hours, with weak and limited effects noted in previous studies, such as against Acinetobacter baumannii. In contrast, D4 reduced biofilm percentages by 21.2% at 10 μg/mL, 92.9% at 40 μg/mL, and 93.6% at 20 μg/mL, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirming complete inhibition at 20 μg/mL. The antibiofilm effect of D4 was achieved by regulating the expression of biofilm-related genes, including relQ, rsbU, spA, icaD, RSH, and sigB, suggesting a mechanism involving gene expression modulation ( source ). Another study, published in ScienceDirect (2023), explored repurposing Ivermectin and ciprofloxacin in nanofibers for wound healing and infection control against multidrug-resistant (MDR) wound pathogens. The composite nanofiber (CIP-IVM NF), with Ivermectin concentrations ranging from 0.3–0.5 μg/mL and ciprofloxacin from 1.6–2.5 μg/mL, successfully disintegrated biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This suggests that Ivermectin, when combined with other antimicrobial agents, can enhance biofilm disruption, particularly in wound healing contexts ( source ). Research on the gut microbial ecosystem, published in MDPI (2023), investigated Ivermectin's impact on gut microbiota using a Triple-SHIME® simulator with fecal material from healthy adults. The study found that Ivermectin introduced minor and temporary changes to the gut microbial community in terms of composition and metabolite production, as revealed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, flow cytometry, and GC-MS. While this study did not explicitly focus on biofilms, the gut microbial community includes biofilm-forming bacteria, suggesting a potential indirect effect ( source ). Positive Impacts and Efficacy Rates Ivermectin's efficacy varies by condition, with clinical trials providing robust data on cure rates and reductions in parasite load. Below is a detailed list, organized by disease, with percentages derived from peer-reviewed studies: Onchocerciasis (River Blindness): Impact: Ivermectin significantly reduces microfilarial density, crucial for preventing blindness and skin manifestations. Efficacy: Community-based studies, such as one conducted in Liberia, show an 84% reduction in microfilarial density after two years of annual treatment with doses around 150 μg/kg. This is vital for interrupting transmission and reducing morbidity. Source: PubMed - Community-based treatment of onchocerciasis with ivermectin Strongyloidiasis: Impact: Highly effective in eradicating Strongyloides stercoralis, preventing severe complications like hyperinfection syndrome. Efficacy: Clinical trials indicate a 96% eradication rate with a single dose (200 μg/kg) and 98% with two doses given two weeks apart, based on follow-up stool exams. Source: ScienceDirect - Efficacy of ivermectin for chronic strongyloidiasis Scabies: Impact: Provides effective treatment, reducing itching and skin lesions caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. Efficacy: Studies show a 62.4% cure rate with one dose (200 μg/kg), increasing to 92.8% with two doses at a two-week interval, compared to permethrin's 96.9% with two applications. Source: PubMed - The efficacy of permethrin 5% vs. oral ivermectin for the treatment of scabies Lymphatic Filariasis: Impact: Clears microfilariae, reducing transmission and preventing lymphedema and elephantiasis. Efficacy: A controlled trial showed 100% clearance of microfilariae at day 12 with a single dose (ranging from 21.3 to 126.2 μg/kg), though levels returned to 18-19% of pretreatment at six months, indicating some recurrence. Source: NEJM - A Controlled Trial of Ivermectin and Diethylcarbamazine in Lymphatic Filariasis Head Lice: Impact: Effective in treating Pediculus humanus capitis, especially in cases resistant to topical treatments. Efficacy: Oral Ivermectin at 400 μg/kg showed a 95.2% efficacy rate on day 15 in difficult-to-treat cases, based on intention-to-treat analysis. Source: NEJM - Oral Ivermectin versus Malathion Lotion for Difficult-to-Treat Head Lice Enterobiasis (Pinworms): Impact: Offers moderate efficacy against Enterobius vermicularis, reducing perianal pruritus and infection rates. Efficacy: Literature suggests a cure rate of up to 85% with a single oral dose ranging from 50 to 200 μg/kg, though it is less effective compared to albendazole. Source: ScienceDirect - Ivermectin - an overview Ascariasis: Impact: Effective in treating Ascaris lumbricoides, reducing worm burden and preventing complications like intestinal obstruction. Efficacy: Comparable to albendazole, with a high parasitological cure rate, estimated at around 95%, based on Cochrane reviews showing no significant difference from albendazole's 95.7% cure rate. Source: Cochrane - Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis Pharmacological Actions Ivermectin's mechanism of action is highly specific to parasites, ensuring minimal impact on human hosts. It primarily acts by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl) in invertebrates, which are critical for nerve and muscle function. This binding increases chloride ion permeability, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, paralysis, and subsequent death of the parasite. Technical Details: Ivermectin selectively binds to GluCl channels, causing an influx of chloride ions, which hyperpolarizes the parasite's nerve and muscle cells. This disrupts neurotransmission, leading to flaccid paralysis and death. It may also affect GABA-gated chloride channels, enhancing its antiparasitic effect. Safety in Mammals: In mammals, GluCl and GABA-gated channels are primarily located in the central nervous system. Ivermectin does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier, limiting its action to peripheral tissues and ensuring safety. This selective action is due to differences in P-glycoprotein expression between parasites and mammals, with parasites lacking effective efflux mechanisms. Immune Modulation: Some studies suggest Ivermectin may enhance the host immune response by suppressing parasite-secreted proteins that evade immune detection, though this is secondary to its direct antiparasitic action. Source: Drugs.com - Ivermectin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects , Warnings, Cureus - Ivermectin: A Multifaceted Drug With a Potential Beyond Anti-parasitic Therapy Anticancer Effects Ivermectin has emerged as a candidate for anticancer therapy, with mechanisms including inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy. Its action involves regulating signaling pathways like Akt/mTOR and PAK1, which are critical in cancer cell survival. Breast Cancer: A notable study using a 4T1 mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) demonstrated Ivermectin’s synergy with anti-PD1 therapy. Complete tumor regression was observed in 40% of mice (6 out of 15) on combination therapy, compared to 5% (1 out of 20) on Ivermectin alone and 10% (1 out of 10) on anti-PD1 alone [1]. Long-term survival rates varied, with approximately 75% survival in neoadjuvant settings with Ivermectin, anti-PD1, and IL-2, and 40% in adjuvant and metastatic settings [1]. These findings suggest Ivermectin converts “cold” tumors to “hot,” enhancing immune response, but are limited to animal models, with human trials ongoing. Glioblastoma: Research indicates Ivermectin inhibits glioblastoma cell proliferation dose-dependently, inducing apoptosis via caspase-dependent pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction. It also blocks angiogenesis by affecting endothelial cells, potentially preventing tumor metastasis [2]. However, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier limits clinical application, and no specific percentages were provided for human outcomes. Other Cancers: Ivermectin shows antitumor effects across various cell lines, including colon, ovarian, and leukemia, by promoting programmed cell death (apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis) and reversing multidrug resistance. A study noted its efficacy in combination with chemotherapy, enhancing outcomes, but lacked specific human efficacy percentages [3]. Antiviral Effects Ivermectin’s antiviral properties have been extensively studied, particularly against SARS-CoV-2, with broader implications for RNA and DNA viruses. Its mechanism involves inhibiting viral replication, potentially by interfering with host factors like importin α/β1. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): In vitro, Ivermectin achieved a remarkable 5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48 hours in Vero-hSLAM cells, suggesting potent antiviral activity [4]. Clinical trials have shown mixed results. A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs involving 2438 participants found Ivermectin reduced the risk of death by 62% (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.19–0.73), with moderate-certainty evidence [5]. However, another RCT found no significant difference in symptom resolution time (82% vs. 79% resolved by day 21, hazard ratio 1.07, p=0.53), highlighting variability [6]. Controversy surrounds these findings, with some studies retracted and debates over dosage and efficacy, especially given FDA and WHO cautions against its use for COVID-19 outside clinical trials. Other Viruses: Ivermectin has shown activity against Zika, dengue, and influenza in vitro, with studies reporting reductions in viral load, but specific percentages for human outcomes are scarce. A systematic review noted its broad-spectrum potential, but most data are preclinical [7]. Anti-inflammatory Effects Ivermectin’s anti-inflammatory effects are well-documented, particularly in dermatological and respiratory contexts, mediated by reducing proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6, and suppressing NF-κB pathways. Rosacea: Clinical trials for papulopustular rosacea demonstrate high efficacy. Two RCTs (Stein Gold et al., 2014a) showed treatment success (IGA 0 or 1) in 38.4% and 40.1% of patients after 12 weeks with Ivermectin 1% cream, compared to 11.6% and 18.8% with vehicle (p<0.001) [8]. Another study comparing Ivermectin to metronidazole found 84.9% success versus 75.4% after 16 weeks (p<0.001) [9]. Long-term data (40 weeks) showed success rates rising to 71.1% and 76.0% [8]. A review also noted 40-80% lesion clearance in 1371 patients after 3 months, supporting its role in improving quality of life [10]. Other Inflammatory Conditions: Ivermectin’s anti-inflammatory effects extend to conditions like asthma, where it suppressed mucus hypersecretion and immune cell recruitment in mice, and late-stage COVID-19, with a meta-analysis suggesting a 68% mortality reduction in hospitalized patients [11]. These findings indicate systemic and lung-specific anti-inflammatory actions, but human data beyond rosacea are preliminary. Antibacterial Effects While less emphasized, Ivermectin shows antibacterial activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. An in vitro study reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6.25 μg/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 12.5 μg/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), indicating potential against bacterial infections [12]. However, clinical data on human antibacterial use are limited, and its relevance for intake is unclear without further studies. Treatment Protocols Oral Ivermectin is mainly used for parasitic infections, with specific protocols based on the condition: Strongyloidiasis: Typically a single dose of 200 mcg/kg. Onchocerciasis: A single dose of 150 mcg/kg, possibly repeated every 3 to 12 months. Scabies: Usually 200 mcg/kg as a single dose, sometimes repeated after 1-2 weeks, with multiple doses for severe cases like crusted scabies. Head Lice: Often treated with topical forms, but oral use can be 200 mcg/kg, sometimes needing a second dose. Pharmacological Actions Outside Parasitic Purposes Beyond its role in treating parasitic infections, Ivermectin has been explored for other pharmacological effects, particularly antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. These are based on in vitro, animal, and some clinical studies, but their clinical utility remains under investigation. Antiviral Properties: Ivermectin's antiviral potential has been extensively studied, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A seminal study by Caly et al. (2020) demonstrated that Ivermectin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, achieving a ~5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48 hours [ScienceDirect: Ivermectin Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011]. A systematic review by Nature (2020) also summarizes its effects against RNA viruses like Zika, dengue, and yellow fever, and DNA viruses like BK polyomavirus, suggesting mechanisms such as blocking nuclear import of viral proteins [Nature: Ivermectin Antiviral Effects, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-020-0336-z]. However, clinical trials, such as those reviewed in eClinicalMedicine, show mixed results, with concentration-dependent antiviral activity but no clear clinical benefit for COVID-19, highlighting the need for large trials [eClinicalMedicine: Antiviral Effect of High-Dose Ivermectin, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370%2821%2900239-X/fulltext]. The controversy around its use for COVID-19, with some studies suggesting reduced mortality and others showing no benefit, underscores the need for cautious interpretation. Anticancer Properties: Recent research has explored Ivermectin's potential as an anticancer agent, with preclinical studies showing promising results. A PMC article (2020) notes that Ivermectin inhibits proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenic activity in various cancer cells, potentially through regulating PAK1 kinase and promoting programmed cell death like apoptosis and autophagy [PMC: Ivermectin Anticancer Effects, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7505114/]. Another study in Frontiers (2021) found it effective against colorectal cancer cells, inducing cytotoxicity and inhibiting growth [Frontiers: Ivermectin in Colorectal Cancer, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.717529/full]. It also reverses multidrug resistance in cancer cells, as shown in a Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research study (2019), by targeting the EGFR/ERK/Akt/NF-κB pathway. However, these findings are primarily in vitro and animal models, with no established human cancer treatment protocols, and claims of it being a \"cure\" for cancer are false, as clarified by AP News (2023) [AP News: Ivermectin and Cancer Claims, https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ivermectin-nih-cancer-cure-629592291079]. Anti-inflammatory Effects: Ivermectin's anti-inflammatory properties have been observed in models of skin inflammation and asthma. A PMC article (2024) discusses its ability to mitigate skin inflammation and reduce cytokine production (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation models, suggesting potential for managing inflammatory skin conditions and possibly autoimmune diseases [PMC: Ivermectin Multifaceted Therapeutic, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11008553/]. Another study in a murine asthma model showed diminished immune cell recruitment and cytokine production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, indicating immunomodulatory effects [PMC: Ivermectin Anti-inflammatory Properties, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539925/]. These effects are promising but require further clinical validation. Detailed Protocols by Condition COVID-19 COVID-19 has been a significant focus for repurposing ivermectin, given its in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Several clinical trials have explored oral ivermectin, with the following protocols noted: 12 mg Daily for 5 Days: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh, involved 72 hospitalized patients, with one arm receiving 12 mg once daily for 5 days. This protocol showed earlier virological clearance (9.7 days vs. 12.7 days for placebo, p = 0.02), but no significant clinical symptom improvement [Reference: International Journal of Infectious Diseases, DOI: https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32506-6/fulltext]. 24 mg Daily for 5 Days: A multi-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 used 24 mg daily for 5 days (400 μg/kg for an average 60 kg patient). This resulted in a statistically significant lower viral load but no significant effect on clinical symptoms [Reference: BMC Infectious Diseases, DOI: https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-024-09563-y]. 400 μg/kg Once Daily for 3 Days: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Brazil involved outpatients with early COVID-19, using 400 μg/kg once daily for 3 days. This did not prevent hospitalization or extended emergency department observation, indicating limited clinical benefit [Reference: New England Journal of Medicine, DOI: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2115869]. Despite these protocols, the efficacy remains debated. The World Health Organization and FDA recommend use only within clinical trials, citing inconclusive evidence and potential risks from self-medication, especially with animal formulations [Reference: WHO, https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-advises-that-ivermectin-only-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-within-clinical-trials; FDA, https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19]. Rosacea Rosacea, an inflammatory skin condition, is primarily treated with topical ivermectin (1% cream, FDA-approved). However, oral ivermectin has been used off-label in refractory cases, based on case reports: Single Dose of 200–250 μg/kg: One case report described a 44-year-old man with chronic rosacea treated with a single 250 μg/kg dose, showing significant improvement and remission for 6 months [Reference: Actas Dermo-Sifiliográficas, DOI: https://www.actasdermo.org/es-oral-ivermectin-treat-papulopustular-rosacea-articulo-S1578219017301944]. Another report used 200 μg/kg with subsequent topical permethrin, effective for rosacea-like demodicidosis [Reference: PubMed, DOI: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10534645/]. Dengue 400 μg/kg Daily for 3 Days: A combined phase 2/3 randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in adult dengue patients used 400 μg/kg daily for 3 days. This accelerated NS1 antigenemia clearance (71.5 hours vs. 95.8 hours for placebo, p = 0.014), but no clinical efficacy was observed, with similar rates of dengue hemorrhagic fever (24.0% vs. 31.1%, p = 0.260) [Reference: PubMed, DOI: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462580/]. Emerging Research and Other Potential Uses Beyond these, research suggests potential for ivermectin in other non-parasitic conditions, though specific oral protocols are less established: Cancer: Preclinical studies show antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cancer cell lines, but no clinical trials provide human dosing protocols. Safety data indicate doses up to 2 mg/kg in healthy volunteers with no serious adverse reactions, but this is not specific to cancer [Reference: PMC, DOI: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7505114/]. Autoimmune Diseases: Research, including a patent (WO2019136211A1), suggests ivermectin may treat autoimmune conditions by reducing Demodex mites, potentially linked to diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. A mouse study on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis used 10 mg/kg orally, showing protective effects, but human protocols are lacking [Reference: PMC, DOI: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209955/]. High-Dose Studies and Safety Research has explored higher doses to understand safety limits, particularly in clinical trials for non-standard uses. A pivotal study by Guzzo et al. (2002) investigated escalating high doses in healthy adults, testing single doses up to 120 mg, which corresponded to approximately 2000 μg/kg for some subjects (e.g., 120 mg for a 60 kg person is 2000 μg/kg). This study, published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, found that doses up to 10 times the FDA-approved 200 μg/kg (i.e., 2000 μg/kg) were generally well-tolerated, with no indication of central nervous system toxicity and adverse events similar to placebo. Another significant trial, published in JAMA in 2023, examined a 6-day regimen of 600 μg/kg daily for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. This study, accessible at [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801827], reported adverse events in 8.3% of the ivermectin group (53/635) compared to 6.3% in the placebo group (41/652), with no serious adverse events attributed to the drug. Common side effects included cognitive impairment, blurred vision, and dizziness, which were self-resolving. This suggests that a total dose of 3600 μg/kg over 6 days is safe for short-term use. Prolonged Treatment Protocols For conditions requiring extended treatment, such as crusted scabies or severe strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients, multiple doses at standard levels are common. For crusted scabies, guidelines from the CDC (accessed at [https://www.cdc.gov/scabies/hcp/clinical-care/index.html] on July 14, 2025) recommend 200 μg/kg doses on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 22, and 29 for severe cases, totaling up to 1400 μg/kg over 29 days. This protocol, while long, uses standard doses per administration, with spacing to allow drug elimination. In strongyloidiasis, especially in hyperinfection syndrome, the CDC advises daily dosing at 200 μg/kg until stool and sputum exams are negative for at least two weeks, potentially lasting several weeks. This prolonged daily use at standard doses has been reported safe in clinical practice, as seen in case reports and guidelines, but higher daily doses are not typically recommended. Toxicity and Safety Thresholds Toxicity reports, such as those in the New England Journal of Medicine (2021, accessible at [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907]), highlight risks with veterinary formulations or inappropriate dosing. Cases involved doses up to 125 mg (approximately 1786 μg/kg for a 70 kg person), leading to symptoms like altered mental status, especially with repeated dosing every other day or twice weekly. A PubMed study from 2022 (accessible at [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36374218/]) noted chronic daily use of 13.5 mg (about 193 μg/kg for 70 kg) over 3.8 weeks caused milder toxicity, suggesting daily standard doses over weeks can accumulate to unsafe levels. The Guzzo study’s finding that 2000 μg/kg was safe contrasts with some toxicity cases, likely due to controlled settings versus self-medication with veterinary products. Pharmacokinetic analysis shows minimal accumulation with dosing every 48 hours or more, supporting spaced high-dose regimens. Comparative Analysis of Protocols To summarize the longest and safest protocols with high dosages, consider the following table, which outlines key regimens from clinical studies: Protocol Dose per Administration Frequency/Duration Total Dose (for 70 kg) Safety Notes Guzzo et al. Single Dose Up to 2000 μg/kg Single dose 140 mg Safe, no CNS toxicity, tested in healthy adults, adverse events similar to placebo. JAMA COVID-19 Trial 600 μg/kg/day Daily for 6 days 252 mg (3600 μg/kg total) Safe, minimal serious adverse events, some visual disturbances, short-term use. Crusted Scabies (CDC) 200 μg/kg Up to 7 doses over 29 days 98 mg (1400 μg/kg total) Safe, standard dose, spaced to minimize accumulation, used in severe cases. Strongyloidiasis (Severe) 200 μg/kg/day Daily until clear, weeks Variable, e.g., 140 mg/week Safe at standard dose, prolonged use reported, higher daily doses not standard."

Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs."

    "title": "Lithium Orotate",
    "url": "wiki/alone-lithium-orotate.html",
    "content": "Lithium Orotate Pharmacological Actions The pharmacological effects of lithium orotate are primarily due to the lithium ion, which dissociates in solution and is believed to exert similar actions as other lithium salts. The following actions are inferred from general lithium research, given the limited specific data for orotate: Mood Stabilization: Lithium is well-known for stabilizing mood swings in bipolar disorder, likely through modulation of neurotransmitter systems and second messenger pathways. It may reduce mania and prevent depressive episodes, though lithium orotate's efficacy is less studied ( source ). Neuroprotection: Lithium promotes neurogenesis and increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protecting against oxidative stress and apoptosis. This is supported by studies on lithium's role in neurodegenerative diseases, potentially applicable to orotate ( source ). Neurotransmitter Modulation: Lithium affects dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and GABA levels. It modulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, which may contribute to its mood-stabilizing effects ( source ). Inhibition of Second Messenger Systems: Lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), impacting cellular signaling pathways like the phosphoinositide cycle, which is crucial for mood regulation ( source ). Circadian Rhythm Regulation: Lithium stabilizes circadian rhythms, which is important for mood disorders, potentially through effects on biological clocks ( source ). Anti-inflammatory Effects: Lithium reduces inflammation, which may play a role in its therapeutic effects, particularly in mood disorders with an inflammatory component ( source ). The time to effect for these actions varies. Acute effects, such as neurotransmitter modulation, may be felt within hours or days, as anecdotal reports suggest ( source ). However, for therapeutic effects like mood stabilization, which involve neuroprotection and circadian regulation, it may take 1-3 weeks, similar to prescription lithium, though specific data for orotate is scarce. Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life and Bioavailability The pharmacokinetics of lithium orotate are not as well-documented as those of lithium carbonate. The half-life, or the time it takes for half the dose to be eliminated, is likely similar to lithium carbonate, which ranges from 18-36 hours, with an average of about 24 hours, based on studies showing no significant differences in uptake, distribution, and excretion between lithium orotate and other salts in rats ( source ). Bioavailability, particularly via the oral route, is high for lithium salts, with lithium carbonate having nearly 100% absorption. For lithium orotate, some sources suggest enhanced bioavailability due to its orotate form, which may cross the blood-brain barrier more easily, potentially allowing for lower doses ( source ). Given the conflicting evidence, it seems likely that oral bioavailability is high, but exact figures are not established. Dosage and Safety Profile Dosage recommendations for lithium orotate are based on its use as a supplement, with much lower doses compared to prescription lithium: Supplemental Doses: Typically, lithium orotate supplements provide 5-20 mg of elemental lithium per day. For example, a 120 mg lithium orotate capsule may contain about 4.6 mg of lithium, calculated from its composition (3.83 mg lithium per 100 mg lithium orotate, as per Lithium orotate - Wikipedia ). Safe Range: The safe range is generally considered to be up to 20 mg elemental lithium daily, based on supplemental use, with no well-defined RDA, though 1 mg/day is sometimes suggested as a dietary intake ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: Not well-defined due to its supplemental nature, but low doses like 5 mg are commonly used for mood support. Maximum Safe Dose: Not established; exceeding recommended doses may lead to toxicity, similar to prescription lithium, with symptoms like nausea and tremors reported at higher intakes (e.g., 69 mg lithium causing minor symptoms, as per a case report in Lithium orotate: A superior option for lithium therapy? - PMC ). LD50: Specific LD50 values for humans are not available. Animal studies, such as a toxicological evaluation, found a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 400 mg/kg bw/day in rats, which translates to high doses, but human extrapolation is uncertain ( source ). Danger Threshold: Toxicity may start when doses lead to serum lithium levels above 1.5 mmol/L, similar to prescription lithium, but exact thresholds for orotate are unclear due to limited data. Higher doses may cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and in severe cases, seizures and coma, as seen with prescription lithium. Comparative Context and Controversies Lithium orotate is often compared to lithium carbonate, with claims of better bioavailability and lower toxicity at lower doses. However, these claims are controversial, with early studies suggesting higher brain concentrations (Kling et al., 1978), while later research found no significant pharmacokinetic differences (Smith, 1976). The lack of large-scale clinical trials for lithium orotate, especially for therapeutic uses, adds to the uncertainty, making it not recommended as an alternative for bipolar disorder treatment compared to lithium carbonate ( source ). Table: Summary of Key Parameters for Lithium Orotate Parameter Details Pharmacological Actions Mood stabilization, neuroprotection, neurotransmitter modulation, etc. Time to Effect Hours to days for acute effects; 1-3 weeks for therapeutic effects (estimated) Half-Life Approximately 24 hours (similar to lithium carbonate, based on limited data) Oral Bioavailability High, possibly better than lithium carbonate, but evidence is conflicting Safe Dose Range 5-20 mg elemental lithium daily (supplemental use) Toxicity Threshold May start at doses leading to serum levels >1.5 mmol/L, exact data lacking"

    "title": "Lumbrokinase",
    "url": "wiki/alone-lumbrokinase.html",
    "content": "Lumbrokinase Pharmacological Actions Lumbrokinase exhibits multiple pharmacological effects, primarily centered around its fibrinolytic and antithrombotic properties. The following actions have been identified: Fibrinolytic Activity: Lumbrokinase directly degrades fibrin, the protein mesh in blood clots, and activates the plasminogen system to produce plasmin, which further dissolves clots. It inhibits Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), enhancing the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), thus amplifying fibrinolytic effects. Studies, such as Lumbrokinase Mechanism of Action , confirm its dual action, both direct and indirect, distinguishing it from similar enzymes like nattokinase. Anti-platelet Activity: Research suggests Lumbrokinase inhibits platelet aggregation and function, reducing the likelihood of clot formation. This is supported by studies like Lumbrokinase and Platelet Function , which highlight its anticoagulation effects. Anti-inflammatory Activity: It inhibits Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, reducing inflammation, particularly in conditions like myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This is detailed in Lumbrokinase and Myocardial Injury , showing its cardioprotective potential. Inhibition of Fibroblast Migration and Adhesion: Lumbrokinase prevents intra-abdominal adhesion by inhibiting fibroblast migration and adhesive activities via the AP-1/ICAM-1 signaling pathway, as evidenced by Intra-abdominal Adhesion Study . The timing of these actions' influence is not explicitly detailed in studies, with the half-life (discussed below) providing a general indicator of duration. Further research is needed to quantify onset and duration for each action. Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life and Bioavailability Half-Life: The biological half-life of Lumbrokinase, specifically for the formulation DLBS1033, is approximately 8.6 hours when administered orally, based on a clinical trial in healthy volunteers Clinical Trial on Half-Life . This suggests the enzyme remains active in the body for several hours, supporting its therapeutic use. Bioavailability: Oral absorption is possible, with studies using rat everted gut sacs showing absorption rates of 8.7% at 1.0 mg/ml, 11.5% at 2.0 mg/ml, and 14.7% at 0.5 mg/ml after 2 hours, as measured by fibrinolytic activity Intestinal Absorption Study . MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed absorption into blood, supporting oral efficacy. Enteric-coated formulations are commonly used to protect Lumbrokinase from stomach acid, enhancing absorption, as noted in Lumbrokinase Benefits . However, exact bioavailability percentages in humans are not consistently reported, with estimates suggesting around 10-15% based on ex vivo data. Dosage and Administration Dosage varies depending on the condition and product formulation, often measured in both mass (mg) and activity units (e.g., fibrinolytic units, FU, or lumbrokinase units, LKU): Typical Dosage for Chronic Conditions: 20-60 mg per day, as recommended by products like Boluoke® Boluoke Dosage , taken one to three times daily on an empty stomach. Higher Doses for Severe Conditions: Up to 120 mg per day, with clinical trials for acute ischemic stroke using 600,000 units three times a day (total 1,800,000 units per day), as seen in LUCENT Trial Protocol . The activity per mg varies by product, complicating direct comparisons. Children: Therapeutic dose is 1 capsule per 8 kg body weight per day, according to manufacturer guidelines. Safety, Toxicity, and Adverse Events Lumbrokinase is generally considered safe, with a low incidence of adverse events reported in clinical trials: Safety Profile: A large trial involving 1,560 patients reported a 1.92% adverse reaction rate, including 0.58% skin itching, 0.19% skin rash, and 1.15% nausea or diarrhea, with no major hemorrhages Boluoke FAQ . Common Side Effects: Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, difficulty breathing), and mild headaches, as detailed in Side Effects Article . Risks and Contraindications: Increased bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants or in bleeding disorders. Contraindicated in recent surgery, trauma, active internal bleeding, GI ulceration, or high-risk aneurysm. Caution advised for liver/kidney conditions and pregnant/breastfeeding women. Toxicity and LD50: Specific LD50 data is not available, and toxic doses are not well-defined. The primary concern is excessive bleeding at high doses, particularly in susceptible individuals, with no reported cases of overdose leading to lethality in reviewed studies."

    "url": "wiki/alone-luteolin.html",
    "content": "Luteolin Pharmacological Actions and Specific Effects Luteolin's pharmacological profile is extensive, with effects observed across multiple systems. Below, we detail each action with specific values and mechanisms where available, primarily from preclinical studies, as human clinical data remains limited. Anti-inflammatory: Luteolin suppresses key inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. In animal models, oral administration at doses of 10-50 mg/kg and intraperitoneal doses of 25-100 mg/kg have demonstrated significant reductions in these cytokines, particularly in conditions like sepsis, mastitis, and pancreatitis ( source ). For instance, at 50 mg/kg orally, it reduced IL-6 levels in a sepsis model. Antioxidant: Luteolin acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). It activates the Nrf2/Gpx4 pathway, with studies showing increased SOD levels and reduced ROS fluorescence intensity at doses around 10-20 μM in cell models ( source ). Anticancer: Luteolin exhibits proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects, inhibiting carcinogenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Specific values include an IC50 of 5.9 μM for colon cancer cells and a 24% reduction in liver metastasis in animal models. It affects pathways like K-ras/GSK-3β/NF-κB and upregulates p53 and caspase-3, effective in cancers such as colon, pancreatic, hepatocellular, head and neck, ovarian, mammary, and prostate ( source ). Neuroprotective: Luteolin improves memory and reduces neuroinflammation, particularly in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. It enhances autophagy via TRAF6 and Nrf2 pathways, with doses of 5-10 mg/kg/day in rats showing about 2.8 μM in blood and brain tissues, inhibiting microglia overactivation ( source ). Cardioprotective: It protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury by activating PI3K/Akt and TLR4/NLRP3 pathways, reducing infarct size, and enhancing peroxiredoxin II activity. Doses in animal studies range from 10 to 50 mg/kg, with significant effects on cardiac function ( source ). Antidiabetic: Luteolin reverses glucose intolerance and improves insulin sensitivity via Nrf2 and RIP140/NF-κB pathways, with dietary supplementation at 0.002-0.01% showing benefits in animal models ( source ). Antimicrobial and Antiviral: Luteolin demonstrates antibacterial properties and potential antiviral effects, including against SARS-CoV-2, with proposed mechanisms involving inhibition of viral replication, though specific values are less documented ( source ). Other actions include hepatoprotective effects, musculoskeletal benefits (increasing bone mineral density), and psychiatric effects (antidepressant at 1-3 mg/kg in animals), as detailed in comprehensive reviews ( source ). Pharmacokinetics Half-life: Research suggests a half-life of approximately 2-3 hours in humans, based on a crossover study with artichoke leaf extract providing 14.4-35.2 mg luteolin equivalents, reaching peak plasma concentrations of 59.08-156.58 ng/mL within 30-40 minutes ( source ). Another study in rats reported a half-life of 4.94 ± 1.2 hours, indicating potential species differences. Bioavailability: Luteolin exhibits low oral bioavailability, with only 17.5% of unchanged luteolin detected in rats due to extensive first-pass metabolism, primarily forming glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In humans, free luteolin is minimally detected in plasma, requiring enzymatic hydrolysis for measurement, suggesting systemic bioavailability is limited ( source ). Dosage Considerations Dosage varies by study and condition, with human clinical trials providing the most relevant data: Human Studies: In an autism spectrum disorder trial, a formulation with 100 mg luteolin per capsule was dosed at 1 capsule per 10 kg body weight per day, translating to 300-500 mg/day for children weighing 30-50 kg, with no significant adverse effects reported over 26 weeks ( source> ). Animal Studies: Effective doses range from 10 to 200 mg/kg, with anti-inflammatory effects at 10-50 mg/kg orally and anticancer effects at similar ranges. The LD50 in rats is above 5000 mg/kg, determined via modified Lorke’s method, with no deaths at doses up to 5000 mg/kg, classifying it as practically non-toxic ( source ). Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range in humans appears to be 100-500 mg/day based on clinical trials, with the minimum effective dose likely condition-specific, potentially starting at 100 mg/day for anti-inflammatory effects. Higher doses may be explored, but data is limited. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Given the LD50 in rats and lack of toxicity at 500 mg/day in children, it seems likely that doses up to 1000 mg/day could be tolerated, but this requires further human studies. Supplements often recommend 500-1000 mg/day, as seen in commercial products ( source ). LD50 and Danger Threshold: The LD50 in rats is >5000 mg/kg, suggesting a high safety margin. For a 70 kg human, this would equate to over 350,000 mg, far exceeding typical doses. The threshold for danger is unclear in humans, but chronic high doses (e.g., 200 mg/kg in rats) showed increased liver enzyme activity, suggesting potential hepatotoxicity at very high levels ( source )."

    "content": "Lysine Antiviral activity, anxiety reduction, calcium absorption, cardiovascular health, glucose metabolism, muscle growth, and wound healing. Used to prevent and treat cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus. It works by competing with arginine, an amino acid the virus needs to replicate, potentially reducing outbreak frequency and severity. It may affect serotonin and GABA receptors, reducing cortisol levels and improving stress-induced anxiety, particularly in populations with low dietary lysine intake. Lysine enhances calcium absorption in the gut and reduces its loss in urine, which could help maintain bone health and prevent osteoporosis. Some research indicates Lysine may lower blood pressure and prevent arterial calcification, especially in conditions like uremia. However, the evidence is not yet robust, and more studies are needed to confirm these cardiovascular benefits. Lysine can attenuate the glucose response to ingested glucose without altering insulin levels, suggesting a role in managing blood sugar, which may benefit individuals with diabetes. Lysine supports muscle growth by aiding protein synthesis, essential for athletes and those recovering from injuries. It activates satellite cells and enhances muscle protein production, potentially improving muscle strength and mass. By contributing to collagen formation, Lysine promotes wound healing, supporting skin and tissue repair. Not synthesized by the human body. Research, including a 2020 review on Healthline , suggests that lysine supplementation, at doses over 3 g per day, may reduce the duration and severity of cold sores by blocking arginine, an amino acid essential for HSV replication.

    "title": "Magnesium L-Threonate",
    "url": "wiki/alone-magnesium-l-threonate.html",
    "content": "Magnesium L-Threonate Pharmacological Actions Magnesium L-threonate is primarily investigated for its effects on brain health due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature not as pronounced in other magnesium forms. The following actions are supported by various studies: Cognitive Enhancement: Research suggests Magnesium L-threonate can improve memory, learning, and overall cognitive function. A study involving 109 healthy Chinese adults aged 18-65, published in Nutrients in 2022, found that a daily dose of 2 grams of a Magnesium L-threonate-based formula (Magtein®PS) for 30 days significantly improved scores in all categories of \"The Clinical Memory Test\" compared to a placebo group A Magtein®, Magnesium L-Threonate, -Based Formula Improves Brain Cognitive Functions in Healthy Chinese Adults. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 50 adults aged 50-70, as noted in a 2018 Metagenics review, showed a 13.1% improvement in working memory at week 6 with 1.5-2 grams daily, with effects approaching significance by week 12 ( source ). Neuroprotection: Animal studies, such as a 2020 study on zebrafish published in BMC Neuroscience, indicate Magnesium L-threonate may protect against brain cell death and preserve cognitive function under hypoxic conditions ( source ). While promising, human data is limited. Sleep Improvement: Emerging evidence suggests it may enhance sleep quality, particularly deep sleep. A study mentioned in Verywell Health observed improved deep sleep with 1,000 milligrams daily, supporting memory retention and learning, though details on study duration and population were not specified ( source ). Potential Mental Health Benefits: Research indicates possible benefits for anxiety and depression, potentially due to its influence on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitters. A study reported improved stress and anxiety levels with Magnesium L-threonate compared to placebo, but these findings are preliminary and require further human studies ( source ). The time to observe these effects varies, with cognitive improvements typically noted after 30 days to 12 weeks of consistent supplementation, based on the aforementioned studies. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data for Magnesium L-threonate, particularly in humans, is limited, which complicates precise assessments of half-life and bioavailability. Half-life: Specific half-life data for Magnesium L-threonate was not found in the reviewed literature. However, a study on calcium L-threonate, published in Acta Pharmacologica Sinica in 2011, reported a mean plasma half-life of approximately 2.5 hours for L-threonate, which may provide an indirect comparison ( source ). Given the structural similarities, this might suggest a similar range, but confirmation for Magnesium L-threonate is needed. Bioavailability: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded in a 2024 opinion that magnesium is bioavailable from Magnesium L-threonate, based on a dissociation study, two rat studies, and one human trial ( source ). The human trial (Liu et al., 2016; Krieger, 2013, unpublished) showed a 41% increase in urinary magnesium and a 4.9% increase in plasma magnesium at week 6 with doses of 1.5-2 grams daily. However, exact bioavailability percentages were not quantified, and sources like Healthline and product descriptions claim high bioavailability, especially for brain uptake, without specific figures ( source ). Dosages Dosage recommendations are derived from clinical studies and safety assessments: Common Dosages: Studies typically use 1.5-2 grams per day of Magnesium L-threonate. For instance, the Chinese study used 2 grams daily, and product labels like Life Extension's Neuro-Mag provide 2,000 mg (approximately 144 mg elemental magnesium) per serving. The EFSA opinion notes that 3,000 mg daily provides about 250 mg of magnesium, aligning with the upper limit for supplemental magnesium ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: Based on cognitive benefit studies, the minimum effective dose appears to be around 1.5 grams daily, as seen in the working memory improvement study. Maximum Safe Dose: The EFSA panel considers 3,000 mg/day safe for adults, excluding pregnant and lactating women, corresponding to 250 mg of magnesium, which aligns with the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for supplemental magnesium from readily dissociable salts. Safety and Toxicity Safety assessments are crucial for understanding the risk profile: Safe Range: Up to 3 grams daily is deemed safe based on the EFSA opinion, with no significant safety concerns at this level, considering the magnesium and L-threonate content. LD50: Specific LD50 data for Magnesium L-threonate is not available in the literature. For magnesium in general, toxicity is rare with oral supplements due to renal excretion, but high doses can lead to hypermagnesemia, especially in renal impairment. Animal studies, such as those cited in the EFSA report, did not provide human LD50 values. When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Exceeding recommended doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping, as noted in WebMD ( source ). Serious effects such as irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, confusion, and coma are rare and typically associated with very high doses, particularly in individuals with kidney issues. The EFSA opinion suggests that intakes beyond 3 grams daily should be monitored, especially given the lack of extensive long-term human data. Comparative Analysis To organize the data, the following table summarizes key study findings on human trials: Study Reference Population Dose (g/day) Duration Key Findings Zhang et al., 2022, Nutrients A Magtein®, Magnesium L-Threonate, -Based Formula... 109 healthy Chinese adults, 18-65 years 2 30 days Significant cognitive test improvements, especially in older participants Metagenics Review, 2018, citing Liu et al., 2016 ([Science Review: Magnesium L-Threonate Metagenics Institute 50 adults, 50-70 years, memory issues 1.5-2 13.1% working memory improvement at week 6, approached significance at week 12 Verywell Health, citing sleep study Not specified 1 Not specified Improved deep sleep, supporting memory retention and learning"

    "content": "Matrine Other name: CAS 519-02-8. Alkaloid extracted from plants such as Sophora flavescens. Research suggests the following actions, with mechanisms often involving key signaling pathways: Anti-cancer Effects: Matrine inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, potentially through pathways like NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin. It arrests the cell cycle at G1/G0 phase and inhibits metastasis, as seen in studies on colorectal and lung cancer cells . For example, it reduced tumor volume in mouse models with inhibition rates of 16.29% and 35.35% ( source ). Anti-inflammatory Effects: It reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α, making it promising for conditions like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies on asthmatic mice showed reduced eosinophils and IgE levels, suggesting modulation of Th2 cytokines ( source ). Anti-microbial Effects: Matrine demonstrates activity against bacteria and viruses, potentially due to its ability to disrupt microbial cell processes, though specific time courses are not detailed. Neuroprotective Effects: It may protect against neuronal damage in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, possibly by regulating apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress, as noted in reviews ( source ). Cardioprotective Effects: Matrine has shown potential in treating myocardial ischemia, likely through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, though exact durations of effect are not specified. Half-Life: Research suggests a plasma half-life of approximately 10.0 ± 2.8 hours in humans, based on a study involving oral administration of Antitumor B (ATB) tablets containing matrine, with individual variations up to 17.06 hours ( source ). In rats, half-lives are shorter, at 92-142 minutes, indicating species differences. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is low, with rat studies showing 17.1 ± 5.4% at 2 mg/kg, but human data are less clear. The evidence leans toward poor absorption, with efforts to improve it via transdermal routes noted ( source ). High pre-systemic clearance in humans is suggested, consistent with low exposure levels. Clinical Doses: Human studies have used oral doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg matrine in soft gelatin capsules, showing dose-related pharmacokinetics ( source ). Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The safe range is not fully established, but doses up to 400 mg have been used without severe adverse effects in trials. The minimum effective dose varies by condition; for example, in cancer studies, in vitro concentrations of 50-800 mg/L showed effects, with IC50 at 312.53 mg/L for Hep3B cells ( source ). Maximum Safe Dose and Danger Threshold: The maximum safe dose is unclear, with reports of toxicity at high concentrations (>140 mg/L in 72 hours causing hepatocyte effects). Given potential hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity, doses exceeding clinical trial levels (e.g., >400 mg) may become dangerous, though exact thresholds are not defined. LD50: In mice, the intraperitoneal LD50 is 157.13 mg/kg (95% CI 88.08-280.31 mg/kg), and intravenous LD50 is 72.1 mg/kg (95% CL 68.2-76.5 mg/kg), based on acute toxicity tests ( source ). Oral LD50 data for humans are not available, but animal data suggest high doses are toxic, with oral LD50 in rats reported as >10000 mg/kg for formulated products, likely not pure matrine. Human Toxicity: Potential adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting), hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes), cardiovascular issues (heart rate changes), neurological effects (dizziness, seizures at high doses), allergic reactions (rashes, swelling), and reproductive toxicity (impacts on fertility, fetal development) ( source ).

    "title": "Meclofenoxate",
    "url": "wiki/alone-meclofenoxate.html",
    "content": "Meclofenoxate Pharmacological Actions Meclofenoxate's pharmacological actions are centered around its nootropic and neuroprotective properties. Research suggests it acts as a cholinergic agent, improving performance on memory tests, especially in elderly patients, as noted in Wikipedia: Meclofenoxate. It is believed to increase cellular membrane phospholipids, which may support neuronal membrane integrity and function, potentially contributing to cognitive enhancement. Additionally, studies indicate it may reduce lipofuscin accumulation, a cellular waste product associated with aging, suggesting anti-aging benefits ( source ). However, the exact mechanisms and time course of these effects are not fully detailed in the literature, and further research is needed to quantify how each action influences over time. Half-life The half-life of Meclofenoxate is estimated at approximately 6 hours, derived from a pharmacokinetic study comparing capsule and tablet formulations in healthy Chinese male volunteers. The study measured the elimination half-time (T1/2) of its active metabolite, chlorophenoxyacetic acid, at 5.8 to 6.0 hours ( source ). This indicates that the drug's effects may persist for several hours after administration, but specific onset, peak, and duration data for pharmacological actions are not readily available. Bioavailability Meclofenoxate is administered via oral and parenteral routes, with both shown to be effective. It is a prodrug, rapidly hydrolyzed into DMAE and pCPA, which likely influences its bioavailability. Specific bioavailability percentages, particularly for the oral route, are not widely documented. However, a study on bioequivalence suggests that both capsule and tablet formulations are similarly absorbed, with 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC within the FDA's 80%-125% range, indicating comparable bioavailability ( source ). Dosages Dosage recommendations vary based on the condition and administration route. Typical daily dosages range from 500 mg to 1,000 mg, as suggested by Nootropics Expert: Centrophenoxine, with higher doses up to 2,000 mg daily used in clinical trials for age-related cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, as noted by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation ( source ). This suggests a safe range of 500 mg to 2,000 mg daily, with the minimum effective dose likely around 500 mg daily based on typical use, and the maximum safe dose potentially up to 2,000 mg, though safety concerns increase at higher levels. Safety and Side Effects Meclofenoxate is considered safe with high tolerability, as noted in Wikipedia: Meclofenoxate, with possible side effects including insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, muscle tremor, depression, nausea, muscle tension, and headache, which may indicate overdosage. The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation highlights that most side effects are mild, such as gastrointestinal issues and mild stimulant effects, but raises concerns about DMAE, with serious adverse events reported in a trial, including cardiac failure leading to death, cardiac arrest, and seizures ( source ). Preclinical studies also link DMAE to neural tube defects, advising against use in women of child-bearing age, and it is contraindicated in individuals with severely high blood pressure. Drug interactions are unknown, and consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended before use."

    "title": "Methocarbamol",
    "url": "wiki/alone-methocarbamol.html",
    "content": "Methocarbamol Pharmacological Actions Methocarbamol's primary action is as a CNS depressant, suppressing multisynaptic pathways in the spinal cord, which likely contributes to muscle relaxation and pain relief. It does not directly affect muscle contractility, motor nerve fibers, or motor end plates, suggesting its effects are mediated centrally rather than peripherally. This mechanism is theorized to break the \"pain-spasm-pain cycle,\" though rigorous clinical and electrophysiologic studies have not fully confirmed this. Timing of Pharmacological Actions The onset of action varies by administration route: Oral Administration: Research suggests an onset of approximately 30 minutes, with peak plasma concentrations typically reached in 1 to 2 hours, based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers. Intravenous (IV) Administration: The evidence leans toward an almost immediate onset, with blood concentrations of 19 mcg/mL attained immediately after a 1 g IV dose at 300 mg/minute, as noted in clinical data. The duration of action is generally 4 to 6 hours, inferred from dosing recommendations every 6 hours, though specific duration studies are limited. This aligns with its short half-life, discussed below. Half-Life The plasma elimination half-life of methocarbamol is consistently reported as 1 to 2 hours in healthy adults. Variations exist in specific populations: Elderly: Approximately 1.5 hours (± 0.4) compared to 1.1 hours (± 0.27) in younger adults. Renally impaired: Around 1.2 hours (± 0.6) versus 1.1 hours (± 0.3) in normal subjects. Hepatically impaired: Extended to 3.38 hours (± 1.62) versus 1.11 hours (± 0.27) in normal subjects. This short half-life necessitates frequent dosing, typically every 6 hours, to maintain therapeutic levels. Bioavailability Bioavailability data, particularly for oral administration, show some uncertainty: Oral: It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with studies suggesting high bioavailability, though exact percentages are not universally specified. Rat studies indicate a range of 77% to 112%, suggesting near-complete absorption, but human data are less precise. Some sources imply \"complete\" bioavailability, but this lacks robust confirmation. IV: By definition, IV administration has 100% bioavailability, as it bypasses gastrointestinal and first-pass metabolism. Intramuscular (IM): While not detailed, IM is expected to have high bioavailability, similar to IV, but specific figures are unavailable. Food does not significantly affect absorption, allowing administration with or without meals. Dosage Details Dosage recommendations vary by route and condition, with the following ranges: Oral Administration: Initial Dose: Typically 1500 mg (three 500 mg tablets or two 750 mg tablets) four times daily, totaling 6 grams per day. Maintenance Dose: Reduced to 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 750 mg tablet) four times daily, approximately 4 grams per day. Severe Conditions: Up to 8 grams per day may be utilized initially, particularly in hospitalized patients, with typical doses like 500 mg every 8 hours noted for some cases. IV/IM Administration: Initial dose: 1 gram every 8 hours, with a maximum of 3 grams per day, not exceeding 3 consecutive days. For tetanus, higher doses (up to 24 grams daily orally) have been used, but IV is limited to 3 grams daily. Special Populations: Cirrhosis: 500 mg twice daily is well tolerated. Renal Impairment: Caution with oral, IV contraindicated due to polyethylene glycol. Hepatic Impairment: No specific dose adjustments, but clearance is reduced. Pediatric: Efficacy and safety not established for under 16 years. Elderly: Included in Beers Criteria, avoid in patients over 65 due to increased injury risk (absolute risk increase ~0.2%). Safety Range, Minimum Effective Dose, and Maximum Safe Dose Minimum Effective Dose: Likely around 500 mg every 8 hours for hospitalized patients, though initial doses often start at 1500 mg four times daily for efficacy. Safe Range: Generally up to 8 grams per day orally for severe cases, with IV limited to 3 grams daily for 3 days. Maximum Without High Risks: Exceeding 8 grams daily orally or continuing IV beyond 3 days may increase risks, but specific thresholds are not well-defined. The evidence leans toward caution above recommended maximums due to potential CNS depression and overdose risks. LD50 and Toxicity LD50: In rats, the oral LD50 is 3576.2 mg/kg, but human data are not available due to ethical constraints. Animal studies provide a reference, but direct human applicability is limited. Toxicity and Overdose: Isolated methocarbamol overdose is rare and unlikely life-threatening without multiple drug exposures. Symptoms include nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma, especially when combined with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience, particularly with polysubstance use. Specific populations at risk include those with cirrhosis, renal impairment, substance use disorders, and the elderly. Treatment is supportive, with no antidote available, focusing on airway maintenance, monitoring, and IV fluids if necessary. Estimation of When It Becomes Too Dangerous The point at which methocarbamol becomes dangerously toxic is not precisely defined, but research suggests risks increase significantly with doses exceeding recommended maximums (e.g., above 8 grams daily orally) and in the presence of other CNS depressants. Case reports and clinical data indicate severe symptoms like seizures and coma at high doses, particularly in overdose scenarios, but exact thresholds vary by individual factors such as age, liver function, and concurrent medications."

    "content": "Methylene Blue Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia by chemically reducing the ferric iron in hemoglobin to ferrous iron. Methylene blue, when injected intravenously as an antidote, is itself first reduced to leucomethylene blue, which then reduces the heme group from methemoglobin to hemoglobin. At high doses, however, methylene blue actually induces methemoglobinemia, reversing this pathway. Since its reduction potential is similar to that of oxygen and can be reduced by components of the electron transport chain, large doses of methylene blue are sometimes used as an antidote to potassium cyanide poisoning, a method first successfully tested in 1933 by Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks in San Francisco, although first demonstrated by Bo Sahlin of Lund University, in 1926. Severe methemoglobinemia may be treated with methylene blue. Another use of methylene blue is to treat ifosfamide neurotoxicity. Methylene blue increases blood pressure in people with vasoplegic syndrome (redistributive shock), but does not improve delivery of oxygen to tissues or decrease mortality. Methylene blue has been used in calcium channel blocker toxicity as a possible rescue therapy for distributive shock unresponsive to first line agents. Methylene blue is a dye behaving as a redox indicator that is commonly used in the food industry to test the freshness of milk and dairy products."

    "content": "NAD+ Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a coenzyme essential for energy production and cellular health, often linked to anti-aging benefits. However, when it comes to taking pure NAD+ orally, the evidence leans toward it being ineffective due to challenges with absorption in the digestive system. Pure NAD+ seems likely to be broken down in the stomach, reducing its ability to reach cells in an active form. This is why supplements often use precursors like NR and NMN, which the body can convert into NAD+ more efficiently. If you're considering NAD+ for health benefits, oral supplements are typically in the form of precursors, not pure NAD+. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical coenzyme found in all living cells, playing a central role in metabolism, particularly in redox reactions that generate energy. It exists in two forms: NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced), and is essential for processes like mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation, which are linked to healthy aging. Given its importance, there has been growing interest in NAD+ supplementation, especially as levels decline with age, potentially contributing to age-related diseases. To provide context, precursors like NR and NMN have been more extensively studied for oral use. Chronic supplementation with NR was well-tolerated and increased NAD+ levels in healthy middle-aged and older adults, with potential benefits for blood pressure and arterial stiffness Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NAD+ in healthy middle-aged and older adults .

    "url": "wiki/alone-nattokinase.html",
    "content": "Nattokinase Pharmacological Actions Nattokinase exhibits a range of pharmacological actions, primarily centered on cardiovascular and neuroprotective benefits. These actions include: Fibrinolytic/Antithrombotic Activity: Nattokinase directly degrades fibrin, the main component of blood clots, enhancing clot dissolution. It increases tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which converts plasminogen to plasmin, further promoting fibrinolysis. It cleaves plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), thereby increasing tPA activity and reducing clot formation. Enhances urokinase production, another fibrinolytic enzyme, and inhibits thromboxane formation, which reduces platelet aggregation. Reduces thrombus formation and slows the progression of atherosclerotic plaques, as evidenced by studies showing reduced carotid plaque size and intima-media thickness. Anti-atherosclerotic and Lipid-lowering Effects: Suppresses intimal thickening, a key factor in atherosclerosis. Reduces common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) from 1.13 ± 0.12 mm to 1.01 ± 0.11 mm and carotid plaque size from 0.25 ± 0.12 cm² to 0.16 ± 0.10 cm² after 26 weeks at 6,500 FU daily. Lowers total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol, with significant effects observed in clinical studies at doses of 4,000 FU for 8 weeks, though not always statistically significant. Antihypertensive Effects: Reduces systolic blood pressure by approximately 5.55 mm Hg and diastolic by 2.84 mm Hg after 8 weeks at 4,000 FU, with statistical significance (P < .05). Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Effects: Inhibits platelet aggregation and decreases fibrinogen levels, similar to aspirin but without the bleeding side effects. Prolongs activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with significant prolongation observed at 2 and 4 hours post-administration at 2,000 FU. Neuroprotective Effects: Degrades amyloid fibrils, potentially beneficial in Alzheimer’s disease, with studies showing reduced infarct volume and enhanced fibrinolytic activity in cerebral ischemia models. Protects against neuronal damage, with mechanisms including modulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathway factors. These actions are supported by clinical and experimental studies, such as those published in PMC articles and ScienceDirect reviews, highlighting Nattokinase’s potential in preventing and treating cardiovascular and age-related diseases. Timing of Pharmacological Actions The onset and duration of Nattokinase’s effects vary based on dosage and individual response. Studies indicate: Effects on coagulation parameters, such as increased D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, are observable as early as 2 hours post-administration, with peak effects around 4 hours. Significant changes, such as factor VIII activity decline and aPTT prolongation, are noted at 4 and 6 hours following a 2,000 FU dose. The effects can last up to 8 hours or more, with some studies suggesting activity detectable up to 24 hours, consistent with its prolonged serum presence. This timing is derived from clinical trials, such as Kurosawa et al. (2015), which showed significant elevations in D-dimer at 6 and 8 hours post-dose, and Biogena’s observations of peak clotting effects at 4 hours, wearing off after 8 hours. Half-Life The half-life of Nattokinase is not explicitly stated in many sources, reflecting a gap in pharmacokinetic research. However, indirect evidence suggests: Peak serum levels are observed at approximately 13.3 ± 2.5 hours post-dose, as reported in a pilot study by Ero et al. (2013), indicating a relatively long duration of action. Compared to thrombolytic agents like t-PA and urokinase, which have half-lives of 4–20 minutes, Nattokinase’s effects last over 8 hours, suggesting a longer half-life, potentially in the range of 10-15 hours, though exact figures are speculative without further data. This uncertainty highlights the need for more extensive pharmacokinetic studies, as noted in reviews like Chen et al. (2018). Bioavailability Nattokinase’s oral bioavailability is confirmed, as it is effective when taken by mouth, with detectable serum levels and measurable effects on coagulation. Key points include: Studies, such as Ero et al. (2013), used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect Nattokinase in human blood following oral administration, showing activity from 2 to 24 hours post-dose. Animal studies, like those on rats, demonstrate effective absorption across the intestinal tract, inducing fibrinolysis after intraduodenal administration. However, the exact bioavailability percentage is not specified, with some sources noting a lack of convincing data on metabolism and absorption rates, indicating a need for further research. This oral effectiveness is supported by its long history of consumption in Japan and clinical studies, such as those referenced in PMC articles. Dosage and Safety Dosage recommendations and safety profiles are based on clinical studies and observational data: Common Dosage: Typically, 100 mg (2,000 FU) daily, as noted in Examine.com and WebMD, is used for cardiovascular health, with effects observed in short-term studies. Higher Doses: Doses up to 540 mg (10,800 FU) daily have been used for up to a year in China without adverse effects, as seen in PMC studies with 1,062 participants, showing efficacy in managing atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia. Minimum Effective Dose: 2,000 FU daily is considered the minimum effective dose, based on studies showing significant fibrinolytic activity at this level. Maximum Safe Dose: While higher doses like 10,800 FU have been safe, caution is advised, especially for individuals on anticoagulants, with no clear upper limit defined beyond clinical study doses. Safe Range: Generally, 2,000 to 10,800 FU daily appears safe, with animal studies showing no toxicity at 480,000 FU/kg in mice, suggesting a high safety margin. Toxicity and LD50 Specific LD50 values are not available for humans, but animal studies, such as the ScienceDirect article on acute toxicity, show no mortality or toxicological signs at doses up to 480,000 FU/kg in mice, which is 1,000 times the recommended human dose. This high tolerance suggests a wide therapeutic index, but human data is limited, with most studies reporting no adverse reactions at recommended doses. Risks and When It Becomes Dangerous The primary risk is an increased chance of bleeding, particularly when combined with other anticoagulants like warfarin or aspirin, as noted in Drugs.com and WebMD. Individuals with bleeding disorders, those undergoing surgery, or those on antihypertensive medications should use caution, with recommendations to stop at least 2 weeks before surgery. Excessive doses may exacerbate bleeding risks, with case reports of cerebellar hemorrhage in patients with ischemic stroke history, though such incidents are rare."

    "content": "NM-2-AI HCl Other name: N-methyl-2-aminoindane. A stimulant substance of the aminoindane class. Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent, with a IC50 of 2.4 μM for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. TAAR1 receptor agonist, with an EC50 of 3.3 μM. Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist, with a Ki of 0.49 μM. Binding affinity to 5-HT1A receptor, with a Ki of 3.6 μM. Binding affinity to 5-HT2A receptor, with a Ki of 5.4 μM. Notably, it does not significantly release serotonin or dopamine even at high concentrations (up to 100 μM), suggesting a selective profile focused on norepinephrine systems. This selectivity is derived from in vitro studies, as detailed in Wikipedia: NM-2-AI . User reports from platforms like Bluelight.org suggest that effects are felt within an hour of oral ingestion, with one report noting effects at 50 mg after one hour, described as mood uplift and clear-headedness. The duration isn't specified, but related compounds and user experiences imply effects may last several hours, aligning with its stimulant nature. The half-life, based on animal studies, is estimated at 1-2 hours. This estimation comes from a metabolism study in mice, where blood concentrations decreased from 2.7 µg/mL at 30 minutes to 0.23 µg/mL at 300 minutes, suggesting a half-life around 1.3 hours via rough calculation, consistent with a reported 1-2 hour half-life for its metabolite, 2-AI, in rat brain from a study on MDAI pharmacokinetics ( source ). Dosage recommendations are primarily derived from user reports and online sources like PsychonautWiki, with the following ranges for oral administration: Threshold: Listed as 5 mg, though user reports suggest 50 mg is often the effective starting dose, indicating potential variability. Light: 50-100 mg, where users report positive effects like mood uplift and enhanced reaction times. Common: 100-150 mg, noted as a typical range, but with some reports of negative effects like mood depression and irritability. Strong: 150-200 mg, potentially increasing intensity but also risks. Heavy: Over 200 mg, considered high risk with limited data on safety. User reports from Bluelight.org provide additional context: At 50 mg, effects included uplifted mood, clear head, and improved gaming performance, suggesting this as a minimum effective dose for many. At 100-150 mg, some users reported it as a \"mood killer,\" with depressive effects and potential anger, indicating the start of adverse effects. Related compound 2-AI reports mention nausea and vomiting at higher doses, which may apply to NM-2-AI at similar levels. The safe range and maximum dose without high risks are also unclear due to limited toxicity data. User reports suggest that doses above 100-150 mg may start to become too dangerous, with potential for adverse effects like mood changes and physical symptoms. The minimum effective dose appears to be around 50 mg based on user experiences, aligning with light dose ranges."

    "content": "NMN Research suggests NMN boosts NAD+ levels, potentially aiding heart, brain, and metabolic health. The half-life of NMN seems likely to be short, on the order of minutes, due to rapid conversion to NAD+. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a precursor to NAD+, a coenzyme essential for energy production and cellular repair. Animal studies showing plasma levels peaking within minutes and then declining quickly. NMN is a naturally occurring molecule found in small amounts in foods like avocados and broccoli, but its levels in the body decline with age, contributing to reduced NAD+ availability. NAD+ is a critical coenzyme involved in over 500 cellular reactions, including energy production, DNA repair, and sirtuin activation, which are linked to longevity and metabolic health. NMN supplementation aims to replenish NAD+ levels, potentially mitigating aging-related disorders such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Preclinical studies, primarily in murine models, have demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological actions for NMN, mediated through its role in NAD+ biosynthesis. These actions are detailed in the following table, derived from a comprehensive review of the literature: Condition Pharmacological Action Dose and Administration Mechanism/Effect References Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Ameliorates myocardial injury, reduces infarct size by 44% (before ischemia) and 29% (during reperfusion) 500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 30 min before or every 6 hours for 24 hours Activates SIRT1, mimics ischemic preconditioning, increases glycolysis or induces acidosis for cardioprotection Nicotinamide Mononucleotide: Exploration of Diverse Therapeutic Applications of a Potential Molecule Improves neurologic outcome and hippocampal CA1 neuronal death in cerebral ischemia 62.5 mg/kg, in transient forebrain ischemic mice Reduces PAR formation and NAD+ catabolism Nicotinamide mononucleotide protects septic hearts in mice via preventing cyclophilin F modification and lysosomal dysfunction Alzheimer's Disease Increases mitochondrial maximal OCR, reduces Aβ oligomers induced LTP by 140%, decreases cell death by 65% 500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, for mitochondrial OCR assay; 100 mg/kg, subcutaneous, for 28 days Crosses blood-brain barrier, activates SIRT1, stimulates PGC-1α for mitochondrial biogenesis, inhibits amyloidogenic APP Nicotinamide Mononucleotide: A Promising Molecule for Therapy of Diverse Diseases by Targeting NAD+ Metabolism Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) Increases intracerebral NAD+ concentration, improves conditions like edema, neuronal death, ROS content 300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 30 min after ICH episode Activates Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, reduces neurological inflammation Nicotinamide mononucleotide protects septic hearts in mice via preventing cyclophilin F modification and lysosomal dysfunction Diabetes Improves insulin intolerance, ameliorates glucose intolerance 500 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal, for 7-10 days (high-fat diet); 11 consecutive doses (age-induced) Activates SIRT1, deacetylates p65-NFκB, restores insulin secretion by suppressing IL-1β The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial Obesity and Related Complications Reduces body weight by 4% (100 mg/kg) and 9% (300 mg/kg) over 12 months, improves NAD+ content 100-300 mg/kg, over 12 months; 500 mg/kg daily for 17 days (HFD-induced) Stimulates mitochondrial ATP production, improves glucose intolerance, reduces hepatic citrate synthase activity Long-term administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice Ageing Increases hepatic NAD+ and PARP1 activity, reduces fundus spots, increases tear production, reverses bone density depletion 500 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal, for 1 week (DNA repair); 100-300 mg/kg/day, for 12 months (optical and bone) Reverses age-related NAD+ decline, upregulates compromised genes (76.3% skeletal muscle, 73.1% white adipose, 41.7% liver) The Science Behind NMN–A Stable, Reliable NAD+Activator and Anti-Aging Molecule The pharmacokinetics of NMN are characterized by rapid absorption and conversion to NAD+, with a short half-life due to its quick metabolic turnover. In animal studies, particularly in mice, NMN is absorbed from the gut into blood circulation within 2-3 minutes and transported into tissues within 10-30 minutes after oral administration ( Absolute quantification of nicotinamide mononucleotide in biological samples by double isotope-mediated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ). When given by oral gavage, plasma NMN levels show a steep increase within 2.5 minutes, peak at 5-10 minutes, and then decline to baseline, suggesting a half-life on the order of minutes ( The Science Behind NMN–A Stable, Reliable NAD+Activator and Anti-Aging Molecule ). This rapid decline is attributed to immediate utilization for NAD+ biosynthesis, leading to marked increases in tissue NAD+ levels (2-3-fold in liver over 60 minutes) ( NAD+ intermediates: The biology and therapeutic potential of NMN and NR ). In humans, specific half-life data is scarce, but clinical trials suggest similar rapid metabolism. For instance, a study administering 250 mg/day NMN found no significant increase in blood NMN concentration, while higher doses (1000-2000 mg/day) showed dose-dependent increases, indicating that at lower doses, NMN is quickly converted and not detectable in plasma ( Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) intake increases plasma NMN and insulin levels in healthy subjects ). This supports the notion of a short half-life, likely less than an hour, due to rapid conversion to NAD+ and its metabolites, such as N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, which were measured in some trials ( Effect of oral administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide on clinical parameters and nicotinamide metabolite levels in healthy Japanese men ). The short half-life has implications for dosing regimens, with recommendations for split doses throughout the day to maintain NAD+ levels, as seen in product guidelines suggesting morning and afternoon intake due to NMN's rapid clearance ( Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) Supplement | Double Wood Supplement ). However, the exact half-life remains poorly characterized in humans, with ongoing research needed to establish precise pharmacokinetic parameters, especially given the variability in absorption and metabolism across individuals ( Pharmacokinetics: The Missing Metric to Determine Dosage ). Clinical trials, such as a 60-day study with doses up to 900 mg/day, have shown NMN to be safe with no significant adverse effects, increasing blood NAD+ levels dose-dependently, with optimal efficacy at 600 mg/day ( The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial ). However, the FDA has classified NMN as an investigational drug since late 2022, limiting its availability as a supplement in the U.S., which underscores the need for further safety and efficacy studies ( Nicotinamide mononucleotide - Wikipedia ). Besides oral ingestion, NMN can be taken sublingually (under the tongue) or via nasal spray, both bypassing the digestive system for potentially higher bioavailability. Sublingual supplements and nasal sprays are available and marketed for enhanced absorption. A daily dose of 250 mg NMN for 12 weeks significantly increased NAD+ levels in healthy subjects, suggesting high bioavailability. Given the lack of specific data, it seems likely that taking NMN on an empty stomach is preferable for optimal absorption, but this is based on general principles rather than conclusive evidence. The evidence leans toward empty stomach for potentially better results, but further research is needed to quantify the difference. Sublingual NMN involves placing the supplement under the tongue, where it dissolves and is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes, bypassing the digestive system. A source from NOVOS ( Can you take NMN orally? Or only sublingually? ) confirms that NMN can be taken orally or sublingually, with recent research showing good absorption by mouth, but sublingual administration is often preferred for bypassing the GI tract. Aspect Details Exact Numbers Study Design Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent 80 participants, 60-day duration Dosing Placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg NMN daily, oral, once daily before breakfast 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg Primary Objective Blood NAD concentration increase Significant increase at day 30 and 60 for all NMN groups (p ≤ 0.001), highest at 600 mg and 900 mg Safety and Tolerability No safety issues, well tolerated up to 900 mg daily, based on adverse events, lab, clinical measures Safety and Tolerability No safety issues, well tolerated up to 900 mg daily, based on adverse events, lab, clinical measures Physical Performance Six-minute walking test, distance increase higher in 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg vs. placebo at day 30 and 60 (p < 0.01), longest at 600 mg and 900 mg Blood Biological Age Increased in placebo at day 60, unchanged in all NMN groups, significant difference vs. placebo (p > 0.05) HOMA-IR No significant differences for NMN groups vs. placebo at day 60 Subjective General Health SF-36 scores better in 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg vs. placebo at day 30 and 60 (p > 0.05), except 300 mg at day 30 Conclusion NMN increases blood NAD, safe up to 900 mg, efficacy highest at 600 mg daily oral intake Increased Blood NAD+ Levels: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 80 healthy middle-aged adults (aged 40–65 years) demonstrated that NMN supplementation at doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg daily for 60 days significantly increased blood NAD+ concentrations compared to placebo and baseline. Specifically, the 900 mg group saw an increase from 10.5 ± 6.8 nM to 48.5 ± 19.8 nM at day 60, indicating a substantial boost in NAD+ levels [1]. This enhancement is crucial for cellular function and is a primary mechanism for NMN's effects. Improved Physical Performance: In the same trial, physical performance was assessed using the six-minute walking test. Participants receiving 900 mg NMN daily showed a significant increase in walking distance from 323 ± 113 meters at baseline to 480 ± 128 meters at day 60. This represents an approximate 48.6% increase ((480 - 323) / 323 * 100%), highlighting NMN's potential to enhance physical capabilities, particularly in middle-aged adults [1]. Stabilized Biological Age: The trial also measured blood biological age using the Aging.Ai 3.0 calculator. While the placebo group's biological age increased significantly by day 60 (from 39.8 ± 7.2 years to 45.4 ± 8.2 years), NMN-treated groups showed no significant change. For instance, the 300 mg group went from 42.2 ± 6.0 to 43.7 ± 6.7 years (p = 0.46), suggesting NMN may help maintain biological age, a key anti-aging indicator [1]. Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity: A 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in 25 postmenopausal women with prediabetes and overweight or obesity (BMI 25.3 to 39.1 kg/m²) found that 250 mg/day of NMN increased muscle insulin sensitivity by 25 ± 7%. This was measured via insulin-stimulated glucose disposal using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, with no change in the placebo group. This improvement is clinically relevant, comparable to effects seen after 10% weight loss or certain diabetes treatments [2]. Weight Reduction and Metabolic Health: A study involving middle-aged and older overweight or obese adults (aged 45+ years) taking 2,000 mg/day of NMN (MIB-626 formulation) for 28 days showed a significant body weight reduction of 1.9 kg (95% CI: -3.3 to -0.5, p=0.008). Additionally, total cholesterol decreased by 26.89 mg/dL (95% CI: -44.34 to -9.44, p=0.004), LDL cholesterol by 18.73 mg/dL (95% CI: -31.85 to -5.60, p=0.007), and diastolic blood pressure by 7.01 mmHg (95% CI: -13.44 to -0.59, p=0.034), indicating broad metabolic benefits [3]. Improved General Health Assessment: The SF-36 survey, measuring subjective general health, showed significant improvements in NMN-treated groups compared to placebo at day 60 in the first trial. For example, the 900 mg group improved from 122 ± 17 at baseline to 140 ± 11 at day 60, suggesting better overall health perception [1]. Table of Quantifiable Benefits from Human Trials Benefit Quantifiable Data Study Context Increased Blood NAD+ Levels From 10.5 ± 6.8 nM to 48.5 ± 19.8 nM (900 mg/day, 60 days) Healthy middle-aged adults [1] Improved Physical Performance Walking distance: 323 ± 113 m to 480 ± 128 m (900 mg/day) Healthy middle-aged adults [1] Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity 25 ± 7% increase (250 mg/day, 10 weeks) Postmenopausal women with prediabetes [2] Weight Reduction 1.9 kg reduction (2,000 mg/day, 28 days) Overweight/obese adults [3] Lower Total Cholesterol 26.89 mg/dL reduction (2,000 mg/day, 28 days) Overweight/obese adults [3] Lower LDL Cholesterol 18.73 mg/dL reduction (2,000 mg/day, 28 days) Overweight/obese adults [3] Lower Diastolic Blood Pressure 7.01 mmHg reduction (2,000 mg/day, 28 days) Overweight/obese adults [3] [1] [2] [3] Biochemical Link Between NAD+ and Testosterone NAD+ plays a vital role in steroidogenesis, the process of hormone synthesis, by supporting enzymes like 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, which is essential for converting precursors into testosterone. A review article, \"Regulation of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ⁵-Δ⁴ isomerase: a review\" , highlights that this enzyme requires NAD+ as a cofactor, suggesting that declining NAD+ levels could theoretically impair testosterone production. However, in young individuals with presumably sufficient NAD+, the impact might be negligible. Animal Studies: Insights from Boars and Mice Animal studies provide the most direct evidence on NMN's effect on testosterone. A study on Landrace boars, \"Supplementing Boar Diet with Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Improves Sperm Quality Probably through the Activation of the SIRT3 Signaling Pathway\" ( source ), found that NMN supplementation (at doses of 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks) significantly increased serum testosterone levels (p < 0.05). This suggests that in adult male pigs, NMN enhances testosterone, contradicting the idea of lowering it. The study design involved 32 boars, with serum samples analyzed for testosterone, showing increased levels in supplemented groups compared to controls, as detailed in Figure 2D of the article. Contrastingly, a mouse study, \"Low NAD+ Levels Are Associated With a Decline of Spermatogenesis in Transgenic ANDY and Aging Mice\" ( source ), investigated NAD+ deficiency and found no significant impact on testicular testosterone levels. This study used transgenic ANDY mice, where NAD+ levels were experimentally lowered, and measured testosterone via radioimmuno-assays and LC-MS/MS, with results indicating no suppression in testosterone synthesis despite NAD+ deficiency (see Figure 4A and 4B). This suggests that within a certain range, testosterone production may not be sensitive to NAD+ levels, at least in mice. Human Studies: Limited Evidence Human clinical trials on NMN have primarily focused on safety, NAD+ levels, and outcomes like muscle function, without directly measuring testosterone. For instance, \"Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men\" ( source ) involved 65 men over 65, administering 250 mg/day NMN for 12 weeks, and reported improvements in gait speed and grip strength, with no adverse effects. However, testosterone was not measured, limiting direct applicability. Another trial, \"The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults\" ( source ), included 80 middle-aged adults (40-65 years) with doses of 300, 600, or 900 mg/day for 60 days, focusing on NAD+ levels and physical performance, again without testosterone data. These studies suggest NMN is safe and well-tolerated, but do not address testosterone effects, especially in younger populations. Understanding Downregulation NAD+ biosynthesis involves multiple pathways, with the salvage pathway being predominant in mammals, mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which converts nicotinamide (a byproduct of NAD+ consumption) to NMN, subsequently converted to NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). Research highlights a feedback loop involving NAD+, SIRT1 (a NAD+-dependent deacetylase), and NAMPT, regulated by circadian rhythms. Specifically, the circadian clock machinery (CLOCK–BMAL1) upregulates NAMPT, increasing NAD+ levels, which in turn activates SIRT1. High SIRT1 activity can suppress CLOCK:BMAL1, reducing NAMPT expression, thus forming a negative feedback loop to maintain NAD+ homeostasis. This loop suggests that elevated NAD+ levels from NMN supplementation could lead to reduced NAMPT expression, potentially downregulating endogenous NAD+ production via the salvage pathway. However, NMN supplementation bypasses NAMPT by directly providing NMN, which is converted to NAD+ by NMNATs, potentially mitigating the impact of reduced NAMPT activity. Evidence from Clinical and Preclinical Studies Current research, primarily from short-term human trials and longer-term animal studies, provides insights into the effects of NMN supplementation. A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy middle-aged adults showed that NMN (250 mg/day) significantly increased NAD+ and metabolite concentrations without adverse effects, suggesting no immediate downregulation issues ( source ). In animals, long-term studies (e.g., 1-year administration in mice at 100–300 mg/kg/day) showed NMN was safe, improved insulin sensitivity, and caused no significant side effects, with no evidence of downregulation affecting efficacy ( source ). Potential Risks and Theoretical Concerns Despite these findings, theoretical risks exist. High NAD+ levels from NMN could enhance SIRT1 activity, potentially suppressing NAMPT expression via the feedback loop, reducing endogenous NAD+ production. However, since NMN supplementation directly provides the precursor, this might not significantly impact overall NAD+ levels during supplementation. Long-term effects remain uncertain, with concerns about potential adaptation, such as reduced activity of other NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes or increased degradation by enzymes like CD38, though no human studies have confirmed this. Another concern is the accumulation of nicotinamide, a byproduct of NAD+ consumption, which at high concentrations (1–5 mM) can inhibit NAD+-dependent enzymes like sirtuins and PARPs, potentially affecting feedback regulation ( source ). However, clinical trials have not observed significant adverse effects, suggesting these risks are minimal at current doses. Safety Profile and Long-Term Considerations NMN has been tested in doses up to 1,250 mg/day in humans without significant adverse effects, with studies up to 24 weeks showing safety ( source ). The lack of long-term human studies means potential downregulation risks over extended periods are not fully understood, though animal data suggest no major issues. Comparative Analysis: NMN vs. Other NAD+ Precursors Compared to nicotinamide riboside (NR), another NAD+ precursor, NMN shows similar benefits but with different metabolic fates. NR also increases NAD+ levels, with some studies noting increased LDL cholesterol and fatty liver risks at high doses, but no specific downregulation concerns ( source ). Both precursors seem to bypass significant downregulation, with efficacy maintained in trials. Reported Negative Impacts and Side Effects Clinical trials and anecdotal reports provide insights into potential negative impacts, though specific incidence rates are often lacking. Below is a detailed breakdown based on available data: Gastrointestinal Disorders: The most commonly reported side effects include nausea, diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. A systematic review noted these as predominant in long-term supplementation, consistent with gastrointestinal sensitivity to new supplements ( source ). These effects are typically mild and may occur initially as the body adjusts, especially at higher doses. Headaches and Dizziness: Some users, particularly from X posts and Reddit discussions, report mild headaches and dizziness, often diminishing with continued use . These are not consistently quantified in trials but are noted as transient. Fatigue: Fatigue is another reported side effect, potentially linked to metabolic adjustments. An X post mentioned feeling unusually tired initially, which subsided over time. Skin Reactions: Itching or rash is rare, possibly due to sensitivity, and may resolve over time. The Longevity Technology article highlights potential skin irritations, advising consultation with a dermatologist if persistent ( source ). Neurological Symptoms: Anecdotal reports, particularly on Reddit, mention rare neurological symptoms like blurry vision, tiredness, and depression after long-term use, attributed to quality issues or methylation pathways ( source ). These are not supported by clinical data and may vary by individual. Potential Organ Function Impacts: High doses may affect liver enzymes and kidney health, as noted in the Longevity Technology article, though clinical trials like one with doses up to 900 mg daily found no significant abnormalities ( source ). Medication Interactions: Potential interactions with blood thinners and diabetes medications are noted, possibly due to NMN's influence on blood flow and metabolism, requiring dosage adjustments ( source ). Insomnia: Some Reddit users report mild insomnia due to increased energy, often mitigated by morning dosing ( source ). Allergic Reactions: Rare reports of allergic reactions exist, though not detailed in clinical studies, suggesting individual sensitivity. Clinical Trial Data and Safety Profile Several clinical trials provide quantitative insights into adverse events (AEs): A 60-day trial with 80 participants (20 per group: placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg NMN daily) reported 9 total AEs, with 6 in the placebo group (5 participants, 25%) and 3 in the 300 mg NMN group (2 participants, 10%), including hyperacidity, skin problems, and mouth ulcers. No AEs were reported in the 600 mg and 900 mg groups, and none were attributed to NMN, indicating good tolerability ( source ). Another study with single doses of 100, 250, and 500 mg NMN in 10 healthy men found no significant clinical symptoms, with laboratory changes (e.g., serum bilirubin, creatinine) within normal ranges, suggesting safety ( source ). A 12-week trial with 250 mg/day NMN showed no adverse effects, reinforcing short-term safety ( source ). A systematic review involving 513 participants across 12 studies noted mild side effects, primarily gastrointestinal, but did not provide specific incidence rates, highlighting the need for more long-term data ( source ). Pharmacological Actions and Theoretical Risks NMN is rapidly absorbed and converted to NAD+, enhancing energy metabolism, DNA repair, and sirtuin activity. Pharmacologically, it may influence insulin sensitivity and reduce oxidative stress, but high doses could theoretically lead to: Methylation Concerns: Excess NMN may increase niacinamide elimination via methylation, potentially depleting methyl groups, though no clinical evidence confirms negative impacts ( source ). Organ Function: High doses might strain liver and kidney function, as suggested by anecdotal reports, but clinical trials up to 1250 mg/day show no significant changes in liver enzymes ( source ). Sirtuin Over-Activation: Theoretical risk of over-activating sirtuins, potentially exacerbating SASP, but evidence is lacking ( source ). Anecdotal Reports and User Experiences Anecdotal evidence from platforms like Reddit and X provides additional insights, though not quantified: Users report digestive discomfort, headaches, and fatigue, often resolving with time ( source ). Rare reports of neurological symptoms, like blurry vision and depression, are attributed to quality issues or methylation, but clinical correlation is weak ( source ). Some users note insomnia, mitigated by morning dosing, suggesting energy-related effects ( source ). Dosage and Safety Considerations Doses in studies range from 250 mg to 2000 mg daily, with up to 1250 mg/day tolerated without significant side effects. The Longevity Technology article advises starting with recommended doses and adjusting gradually, especially for those with sensitive conditions ( source ). Research Gaps and Future Directions While short-term studies show safety, long-term effects remain under-investigated, with calls for more extensive trials across diverse demographics. The ScienceDirect article emphasizes the need for proper clinical investigations to address effectiveness and safety concerns ( source ). NMN supplementation appears safe based on current clinical data, with mild side effects primarily gastrointestinal and transient. Anecdotal reports suggest additional rare effects, but without quantified incidence, caution is advised, especially at high doses. Consulting healthcare providers before starting NMN is recommended, given the evolving research landscape. Storage Recommendations: Fridge vs. Shelf Research suggests that the best way to store NMN is in a cool, dry place away from sunlight to minimize degradation. The choice between fridge and shelf depends on the storage duration: Short-Term Storage (Up to 3 Months): A cool, dry shelf is generally sufficient. Sources like RT Medical USA and Neurogan Health recommend storing NMN in a cupboard, avoiding humid areas like bathrooms, to prevent moisture-related degradation. Modern stabilized NMN formulations, such as those from NOVOS, are noted to be stable even at room temperature due to advanced crystalline arrangements, reducing the urgency for refrigeration in the short term. Long-Term Storage (Beyond 3 Months): Refrigeration is recommended to maintain full potency. NAD Lab EU and Neurogan Health suggest that storing NMN in the refrigerator can extend its stability, with Neurogan Health specifically noting up to 18 months of stability under these conditions. David Sinclair, a prominent researcher, has historically emphasized keeping NMN cold to prevent degradation, though this may refer to older, non-stabilized forms. Current evidence leans toward refrigeration being beneficial for long-term storage, especially for maintaining potency over extended periods. Environmental Factors to Avoid: Heat, light, and moisture are critical factors that can accelerate degradation. For instance, RT Medical USA advises against storing NMN in high-temperature areas or humid environments, as these can lead to the breakdown into nicotinamide, reducing effectiveness. Special Case: Mixed with Water: If NMN is mixed with water, its potency is limited to about a week, as noted by RT Medical USA and Neurogan Health. This is relevant for liquid formulations but not for dry supplements, which are the focus of this analysis. Shelf Life of NMN The shelf life of NMN varies based on storage conditions and formulation, with the following details emerging from the analysis: Room Temperature Storage: NMN typically maintains full potency for at least 3 months when stored correctly at room temperature, as per RT Medical USA. Neurogan Health extends this to a range of 3–12 months, advising use within 3 months for best results. NOVOS claims their stabilized NMN maintains over 99% purity even after months, suggesting good stability, though exact timelines vary by product. Refrigerated Storage: When stored in the refrigerator, NMN can remain stable for up to 18 months, according to Neurogan Health. This aligns with NAD Lab EU's recommendation to refrigerate for storage beyond 3 months to maintain potency, especially for stabilized forms. Degradation Risks: Degradation into nicotinamide is a concern, particularly for non-stabilized NMN. Sources like NOVOS and NAD Lab EU note that this process is slow in stabilized forms but can be accelerated by improper storage (e.g., exposure to humidity). RT Medical USA mentions that potency might decrease minimally after 3 months at room temperature, highlighting the importance of storage conditions. Manufacturer-Specific Considerations Different NMN products may have varying stability profiles due to formulation differences. For example: NOVOS emphasizes their next-generation NMN, which is more stable due to a crystalline arrangement, suggesting it can be stored at room temperature with minimal degradation. RT Medical USA and Neurogan Health provide general guidelines, noting that stabilized NMN does not require refrigeration unless stored for extended periods, but always recommend following manufacturer instructions for specific products. Scientific and Expert Insights Scientific papers, such as those from PMC, indicate NMN's stability in water for 7–10 days at room temperature, with 93%–99% remaining intact. While this pertains to liquid forms, it underscores NMN's sensitivity to environmental conditions. Expert opinions, like those from David Sinclair, historically stressed cold storage, but modern production techniques have improved stability, reducing the necessity for strict refrigeration for short-term storage."

    "content": "O-DSMT Also known as desmetramadol and O-desmethyltramadol. Key component of the pain medication tramadol. Known for its strong pain-relieving effects. Works primarily by mimicking natural painkillers in the body. Influences other systems to help manage pain, especially in complex cases. Mainly activates μ-opioid receptors. Much stronger than tramadol, with studies showing it’s 2–4 times more potent. Block the reuptake of norepinephrine, particularly with the (-)-enantiomer. Research indicates it may cause fewer breathing issues compared to other strong painkillers. For people with kidney problems, O-DSMT can build up, increasing risks like seizures or breathing difficulties, so doctors often lower the dose. It's the primary active metabolite of tramadol. O-DSMT is formed through the demethylation of tramadol by the liver enzyme CYP2D6, a process analogous to the metabolism of codeine to morphine. As of May 7, 2025, O-DSMT is not approved for medicinal use in any country but is significant in research and has been noted as a designer drug due to its unscheduled status in some jurisdictions ( source ). The (+)-enantiomer is identified as a G-protein biased full agonist, which means it preferentially activates the G-protein signaling pathway over the β-arrestin pathway. This bias is significant as it may reduce adverse effects like respiratory depression, a major concern with opioids. Up to 200 times greater affinity for μ-opioid receptor than tramadol. Also shows far lower affinity for δ- and κ-opioid receptors. Both enantiomers are inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, distinguishing it from tramadol, which has dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties ( source ). Enantiomer Serotonin Reuptake Norepinephrine Reuptake (+)-O-DSMT Inactive Inactive (-)-O-DSMT Inactive Active (retains inhibition) Antagonism at the 5-HT2C receptor at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This antagonism can lead to increased release of dopamine and norepinephrine, potentially influencing mood, anxiety, feeding behavior, and reproductive behavior ( source ). Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can significantly impact its efficacy and safety. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience reduced analgesia, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may face increased risks of side effects like respiratory depression and death due to higher O-DSMT levels ( source )."

    "content": "Oroxylin A Pharmacological Actions Oroxylin A exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, which have been extensively studied in preclinical models. These include: Anti-cancer Effects: Oroxylin A inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by modulating pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB. It has shown potential against various cancers, including brain, breast, and lung cancer, by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. Specific studies, such as those cited in Pharmacological and Toxicological Properties of Oroxylin A , highlight its role in reversing chemotherapy resistance in leukemia through STAT3 inhibition. Anti-inflammatory Properties: It reduces inflammation by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, and signaling molecules such as MMPs and VEGF. Research, including Oroxylin A: A Promising Flavonoid for Chronic Diseases , indicates its modulation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are pivotal in inflammatory responses. Neuroprotective Effects: Oroxylin A enhances memory and cognitive function, potentially through increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, as noted in studies like The Effects of Oroxylin A on Memory Impairment in Mice . It has been shown to ameliorate memory deficits in models of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative disorder treatment. Anti-viral Activity: It demonstrates antiviral effects, particularly against influenza A virus, with dose-dependent inhibition rates reported in cell studies, as seen in Oroxylin A Suppresses Influenza A Virus Replication . Other Actions: Additional benefits include anti-bacterial, anti-thrombotic, and potential cardiovascular and neurological protective effects, supported by reviews like Overview of Oroxylin A as a Flavonoid Compound . Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data for Oroxylin A is primarily derived from animal studies, particularly in rats, with the following insights: Half-life: Exact half-life values are not explicitly stated in the literature reviewed. However, studies indicate rapid elimination following intravenous administration (2 mg/kg), suggesting a short half-life, though precise numerical data is lacking. ( source ) Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, with relative bioavailability less than 2% for intragastric doses of 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg in rats, as detailed in Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution Study . This low bioavailability may limit its oral therapeutic potential, necessitating alternative delivery methods. Distribution: Following oral administration, Oroxylin A and its metabolites (Oroxylin A 7-O-glucuronide and Oroxylin A sodium sulfonate) show rapid and widespread tissue distribution, with high concentrations in the liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine. This distribution pattern is consistent across studies, indicating systemic exposure. ( source ) Excretion: Excretion profiles vary, with Oroxylin A primarily excreted via feces, Oroxylin A 7-O-glucuronide via bile and urine, and Oroxylin A sodium sulfonate showing minimal excretion, as noted in the same study. Dosage and Safety Dosage information is predominantly from animal models, with limited human data due to the absence of clinical trials: Animal Studies: In mice, a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg has been effective in reversing memory impairments, as seen in Memory Impairment Study in Mice . Higher doses, up to 200 mg/kg orally, showed no toxicity in immunodeficient mice, suggesting a relatively wide safety margin in preclinical settings. ( source ) Human Dosage: There is no established safe range, minimum effective dose, or maximum safe dose for humans. The lack of clinical trials means that LD50 (lethal dose 50%) and thresholds for danger are not determined. Reviews like Oroxylin A for Chronic Diseases highlight the need for dose standardization and toxicity assessments in humans, currently unknown. Safety and Toxicity: Preclinical studies suggest low toxicity, particularly in cancer research, with no significant adverse effects reported at tested doses in animals. However, the translation to humans remains uncertain, and milder side effects may not be captured in rodent models, as noted in Oroxylin A Benefits and Side Effects ."

    "content": "Oxiracetam Oxiracetam is generally considered safe at doses up to 2,400 mg, with few side effects reported. It enhances the release and uptake of acetylcholine. While its primary effects are on acetylcholine and glutamate, there is some indication it may influence dopamine and serotonin to a lesser extent. Oxiracetam exhibits neuroprotective effects, protecting neurons from oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Studies in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion show it decreases neuronal degeneration and white matter lesions, particularly at doses of 100-200 mg/kg, with significant reductions in the hippocampus and cortex. Inhibits astrocyte activation. Increases cerebral blood flow. In animal studies, doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg significantly increased cerebral blood flow, with statistical significance (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Increases ATP synthesis. In the acute phase post-cerebral hypoperfusion, it decreases abnormal accumulation of glucose and citric acid while increasing levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, and GMP in the cortex. enhances antioxidant levels, such as glutathione and ascorbic acid, with significant increases observed (P < 0.01 for glutathione, P < 0.001 for ascorbic acid with (S)-oxiracetam). When administered systemically to rats at 200 mg/kg orally or 100 mg/kg intra-arterially, it is found unmetabolized, with the highest amounts in the septum, followed by the hippocampus, and smaller amounts in the cerebral cortex and striatum. Its distribution pattern is similar when administered directly into the lateral ventricles, indicating its tropism is independent of the administration route. Estimated brain amounts range from 1.9 to 19 nmols/rat, delivered via cannula in conscious, freely moving rats, highlighting its effective brain penetration. Oxiracetam demonstrates specific therapeutic effects, such as dose-dependently antagonizing scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats, which is indicative of its ability to counteract cholinergic deficits. The (S)-enantiomer is identified as the active ingredient, showing higher absorption rates and slower elimination compared to the racemic mixture, and it induces long-term synaptic potentiation in rat hippocampal slices, further supporting its cognitive-enhancing potential. Oxiracetam is generally considered safe, with studies reporting no significant side effects at single and repeated oral dosages up to 2,400 mg.

    "title": "Oxytocin",
    "url": "wiki/alone-oxytocin.html",
    "content": "Oxytocin Pharmacological Actions Oxytocin's pharmacological actions are multifaceted, reflecting its therapeutic and physiological roles: Stimulation of Uterine Contractions: Oxytocin is renowned for inducing and strengthening uterine contractions, essential during labor and for managing postpartum hemorrhage. It activates oxytocin receptors on the myometrium, increasing intracellular calcium and enhancing contraction frequency and strength, regulated by a positive feedback loop during childbirth ( source ). Milk Ejection: It facilitates milk ejection during breastfeeding by stimulating the release of milk from mammary glands, crucial for lactation post-delivery. Behavioral and Social Effects: Research suggests oxytocin influences social cognition, pair bonding, maternal behavior, and fear conditioning. It is implicated in enhancing social interactions and has been explored for potential therapeutic uses in conditions like autism and anxiety, with receptors distributed in the brain stem and amygdala ( source ). Metabolic and Cardiovascular Effects: Oxytocin has pleiotropic effects, including impacts on metabolic functions and cardiovascular regulation, though these are less emphasized in clinical settings. The time course for these actions varies: uterine contractions and milk ejection effects are rapid, typically within minutes, while behavioral effects may have longer, less defined durations, often studied in hours to days for central effects. Half-Life The plasma half-life of oxytocin ranges from 1 to 6 minutes, with a noted decrease during late pregnancy and lactation, reflecting its rapid metabolism and clearance. This short half-life necessitates continuous or frequent administration for sustained effects, such as during labor induction ( source ). Bioavailabilities Bioavailability varies significantly by administration route, influenced by oxytocin's peptide nature and susceptibility to degradation: Parenteral (IV, IM): Administered intravenously or intramuscularly, oxytocin is fully bioavailable (100%), as it enters directly into systemic circulation, reaching steady-state plasma concentrations in approximately 40 minutes ( source ). Intranasal: Intranasal administration is effective for central nervous system effects, with evidence suggesting it crosses the blood-brain barrier, exhibiting psychoactive effects. However, specific bioavailability percentages are not consistently reported, though studies indicate central duration of at least 2.25 hours ( source ). Sublingual: Studies in male volunteers show sublingual bioavailability is very low, ranging from 0.007% to 0.07%, due to limited absorption through oral mucosa ( source ). Oral (Swallowed): Oral administration faces significant challenges due to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract by enzymes like pepsin. Research suggests bioavailability is extremely low, likely less than 1%, with one study noting a 200 IU tablet's effect equivalent to a 0.02 IU/min IV infusion, indicating negligible absorption without protective measures like proton pump inhibitors ( source ). Studies in mice with omeprazole pretreatment show increased plasma levels, but human data remain limited. Dosages Dosages are tailored to the clinical indication, with precise administration guided by patient response and monitoring: Labor Induction: Initiated at 0.5 to 1 milliunits per minute (mU/min) intravenously, titrated by increasing 1 to 2 mU/min every 30 to 60 minutes until a contraction pattern similar to normal labor is achieved, typically up to 6 mU/min, rarely exceeding 9 to 10 mU/min at term due to lower uterine sensitivity before term ( source ). Postpartum Hemorrhage: Administered as 10 units intramuscularly after placenta delivery, or 10 to 40 units added to 1000 mL of IV solution, infused at a rate to sustain uterine contraction and control atony, not exceeding 40 units total in the solution ( source ). Incomplete or Inevitable Abortion: Typically 10 to 20 mU/min IV, with a total dose not exceeding 30 units in 12 hours to mitigate risks like water intoxication ( source ). Safe Range, Minimum Effective Dose, Maximum Safe Dose, and LD50 Safe Range: The safe dosage range is highly individualized, requiring continuous monitoring of uterine activity and fetal heart rate to prevent hyperstimulation and fetal distress. Adjustments are made based on clinical response, with guidelines suggesting not exceeding 10 mU/min for labor induction at term and limiting total doses for abortion to avoid water intoxication. Minimum Effective Dose: For labor induction, the minimum effective dose is approximately 0.5 mU/min IV, initiating contractions, with titration based on response. Maximum Safe Dose: There is no universal maximum, but clinical practice suggests rarely exceeding 9 to 10 mU/min for labor induction at term, and for postpartum hemorrhage, up to 40 units in IV solution. Prolonged high doses increase risks of adverse effects. LD50: Lethal dose 50% (LD50) data are derived from animal studies, with rats showing an LD50 of approximately 20.520 mg/kg and mice 514 mg/kg for systemic administration, indicating relatively low toxicity in animals. Human LD50 is not established due to ethical constraints, but clinical overdose risks include uterine hyperstimulation and water intoxication ( source ). When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous Oxytocin becomes dangerous when it leads to adverse effects such as uterine hyperstimulation, potentially causing fetal distress, or water intoxication from prolonged high doses due to its antidiuretic effect, leading to hyponatremia. Monitoring is critical, with discontinuation recommended if hyperactivity or fetal distress is observed, and oxygen administration may be necessary ( source ). Pharmacological Actions and Side Effect Mechanisms Oxytocin's primary pharmacological action is to bind to G-protein-coupled Oxytocin receptors in the myometrium, increasing intracellular calcium levels and triggering uterine contractions. This mechanism is essential for labor but can lead to hyperstimulation if doses are excessive, reducing placental blood flow and causing fetal distress. The antidiuretic effect, mediated by V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, promotes water reabsorption, which can result in water intoxication, especially with prolonged infusion and large fluid volumes, leading to hyponatremia, seizures, and coma in severe cases. Cardiovascular effects include vasodilation, which can cause hypotension, particularly with rapid intravenous administration, and may lead to arrhythmias. The risk of uterine rupture is heightened in scarred uteri due to pre-existing weaknesses, exacerbated by Oxytocin's strong contractile effects. For unscarred uteri, rupture is rare but can occur with prolonged or high-dose use, likely due to overstretching of the uterine wall. Incidence Data and Limitations Incidence rates for common side effects (e.g., tachycardia, nausea) are derived from drug information sources like Drugs.com, indicating a 1-10% range, which aligns with clinical trial data for similar medications. For rarer events like uterine rupture, specific studies provide estimates: in women with a scarred uterus undergoing TOLAC with Oxytocin, incidence is around 1-2% ( source ). However, exact frequencies for many side effects, such as water intoxication or neonatal jaundice, are not consistently reported, reflecting underreporting in clinical trials and the need for further research. Clinical Implications and Monitoring Given the potential for serious side effects, clinical guidelines emphasize careful monitoring during Oxytocin administration, including continuous fetal heart rate monitoring and maternal vital signs. The FDA has issued a \"black box\" warning for Pitocin due to its high-risk profile, highlighting the need for judicious use ( source ). Water intoxication, for instance, requires monitoring of fluid intake and sodium levels, while uterine rupture risk necessitates avoiding Oxytocin in high-risk cases like multiple prior cesareans."

    "content": "Palmitoylethanolamide Pharmacological Actions Anti-inflammatory: PEA reduces inflammation by modulating mediators and inhibiting mast cell activation, as seen in animal models of colitis where effects were measured 3 days post-induction ( source ). Analgesic: It provides pain relief, with clinical studies showing reductions in pain intensity within 10 to 14 days to 4 weeks ( source ). Neuroprotective: PEA protects nerve cells, potentially beneficial in neurodegenerative conditions, with mechanisms involving PPAR-α and GPR55 receptors ( source ). Immunomodulatory: It modulates immune responses, aiding in conditions like allergies and autoimmune disorders ( source ). Antimicrobial: Limited evidence suggests antimicrobial properties, though less studied compared to other actions ( source ). These actions are mediated through targets like PPAR-α (EC50 3 μM), GPR55 (EC50 4 nM), and entourage effects on CB1, CB2, and TRPV1, as noted in pharmacological reviews ( source ). Time to Effect The time to observe PEA's effects varies by action and condition: Pain Relief: Clinical trials indicate significant pain reduction can occur within 10 to 14 days in some studies, with others showing effects after 4 weeks, reflecting the chronic nature of conditions treated ( source ). Anti-inflammatory Effects: In a murine colitis model, anti-inflammatory effects were assessed 3 days after induction, suggesting rapid action in acute inflammation ( source ). Plasma Concentration: Pharmacokinetic studies show plasma levels peak at approximately 2 hours after oral administration in humans, with a study on 300 mg micronized PEA showing a twofold increase at this time, returning to baseline by 4-6 hours ( source ). This variability suggests that while plasma levels rise quickly, clinical effects, especially for chronic conditions, may require days to weeks. Half-Life The half-life of PEA is relatively short, with data primarily from animal studies: In Rats: Plasma elimination half-time is approximately 12 minutes, calculated from a study using a one-compartment model with first-order kinetics ( source ). In Vitro: Rat liver homogenates show a half-life of about 25 minutes at 50 nM concentration ( source ). In Humans: Not explicitly stated, but plasma levels return to baseline within 4-6 hours after peaking at 2 hours, suggesting a half-life likely in the range of 1-2 hours, based on the observed pharmacokinetics ( source ). In Humans: Not explicitly stated, but plasma levels return to baseline within 4-6 hours after peaking at 2 hours, suggesting a half-life likely in the range of 1-2 hours, based on the observed pharmacokinetic. Bioavailability PEA's bioavailability, particularly via the oral route, is a critical factor due to its lipophilic nature: General Oral Bioavailability: Initially low due to poor water solubility, with estimates suggesting limited absorption in standard forms ( source ). Improved Formulations: Micronized and ultra-micronized forms enhance bioavailability. A study on PEAΩ and PEA DynoΩ showed absorption rates of 82-63% at 3 hours, compared to 30-60% for micronized, ultra-micronized PEA, and commercial products, with optimal doses at 300-600 mg ( source ). Human Studies: A study with 300 mg micronized PEA showed a twofold increase in plasma levels at 2 hours, indicating improved bioavailability with advanced formulations ( source ). Dosage Dosage recommendations vary by population and condition, based on clinical and experimental data: Adults: Typical oral doses range from 300 to 1200 mg per day, used for conditions like chronic pain, diabetic neuropathy, and ALS, with durations from 2 to 12 weeks ( source ). Children: Recommended at 600 mg per day for up to 3 months, primarily for conditions like migraine ( source ). Animal Studies: Doses like 10 mg/kg subcutaneously in mice and 100 mg/kg orally in rats have been used, providing context for experimental efficacy ( source ). Safety, LD50, and Risk Thresholds PEA is generally considered safe, with extensive data supporting its tolerability: Safe Range: Clinical trials suggest doses up to 1200 mg per day are safe, with no serious adverse effects reported for treatment durations up to 49 days at an incidence of 1/200 or greater ( source ). Minimum Effective Dose: Evidence suggests 300 mg per day can be effective, as seen in studies on pain and inflammation ( source ). Maximum Safe Dose: Given the high LD50 and lack of toxicity at therapeutic doses, up to 1200 mg per day appears safe, with reports of 1.8 g/day showing excellent tolerability ( source ). LD50: In rats, LD50 is >2000 mg/kg body weight, indicating low acute toxicity ( source ). When It Starts to Become Dangerous: Given the high LD50 and safety profile, significant risks are likely only at doses far exceeding typical use, potentially above 2000 mg/kg, but specific human thresholds are not well-defined due to limited high-dose studies."

    "content": "Phenylalanine L-Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine. L-Phenylalanine, especially when combined with UV light, is used to treat vitiligo, a condition causing white patches on the skin. It seems to work by boosting melanin production, helping repigment the skin, with studies showing benefits in over 90% of early cases. D-Phenylalanine may interact with the niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine is noted for potential pain relief, possibly by preventing the breakdown of enkephalins, the body's natural painkillers, and may also have antidepressant properties. It is converted to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of L- and D-forms. High levels of phenylalanine can be neurotoxic, particularly in phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder where individuals cannot metabolize phenylalanine properly. Chronic high serum levels can lead to seizures, organ damage, intellectual disability, and behavioral issues like ADHD ( Phenylalanine | C9H11NO2 | CID 6140 - PubChem ). For PKU, early dietary restriction and medication are recommended to manage levels, with D-Phenylalanine potentially arresting fibril formation by L-Phenylalanine, suggesting a therapeutic role ( Phenylalanine | C9H11NO2 | CID 6140 - PubChem ). For instance, a study on energy intake showed that high doses (10 g) increased nausea ratings in overweight/obese women, with no significant effect on energy intake compared to controls ( Phenylalanine | C9H11NO2 | CID 6140 - PubChem ).

    "content": "Proline Research suggests Proline supports connective tissue health, especially skin and joints, through collagen synthesis. It seems likely that Proline aids wound healing and muscle preservation, often used in supplements. The evidence leans toward Proline having neurological effects via NMDA receptors, potentially linked to conditions like hyperprolinemia. Proline is used in total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support, with metabolic roles in pathways like arginine metabolism. Proline is a key building block of collagen. Interestingly, Proline can affect brain cells by interacting with NMDA receptors, which are involved in nerve signaling. While this might contribute to neurological issues in conditions like hyperprolinemia (high Proline levels), its direct therapeutic use in this area is less clear and requires more research. Proline plays a role in metabolic pathways, such as arginine and proline metabolism, which are important for overall body function. This is supported by studies indicating topical application may be more effective for wound treatment than oral supplementation ( L-Proline: Benefits, Side Effects & Dosage | BulkSupplements ). The quality of Proline supplements is also a consideration, with a study assessing seven dietary supplements finding content variability (73–121% in capsules, 103–156% in tablets) and detecting five contaminants, emphasizing the need for quality control ( Dietary Supplements with Proline—A Comprehensive Assessment of Their Quality | PMC ). Proline’s most prominent pharmacological action is its role in collagen synthesis, where it constitutes a significant portion of the glycine-proline-hydroxyproline triplets forming the triple-helical structure of collagens. Clinically, this translates to its use in addressing conditions requiring tissue repair, such as arthritis or post-surgical recovery ( L-Proline | Health Benefits and Uses of L-Proline | Xtendlife ). Proline is involved in several metabolic pathways, notably arginine and proline metabolism, which are crucial for energy production and amino acid interconversion. It is a substrate for Proline dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial (PRODH), which converts Proline to delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a step in its catabolism. This enzyme’s activity is linked to cell proliferation and tumor development, suggesting Proline’s role in metabolic stress responses, particularly in cancer cells ( Proline Dehydrogenase - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ). At the molecular level, Proline binds to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (e.g., PPIB, PPIA), enzymes that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, influencing protein folding and conformation. This action is significant for structural proteins like collagen. Additionally, Proline inhibits monocarboxylate transporter 10 (SLC16A10), which transports thyroid hormones and aromatic acids, potentially affecting hormonal and metabolic regulation ( Proline: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online ). A study on CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells demonstrated that L-Proline induces depolarization, primarily via postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation, leading to multiple orthodromic population spikes and potential depolarization block. This action suggests neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic potential, with implications for conditions like hyperprolinemia, where elevated Proline levels may contribute to seizures and mental retardation ( NMDA receptor-mediated depolarizing action of proline on CA1 pyramidal cells | ScienceDirect ). Additionally, defects in neural Proline transport, mediated by transporters like SLC6A7 (PROT1) and SLC6A19 (B0AT1), are associated with ataxia and psychosis. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A7 has been shown to reduce locomotor activity and improve learning and memory in mice, highlighting Proline’s role in cognitive and motor functions ( Frontiers | The Multifaceted Roles of Proline in Cell Behavior ). Proline’s role in pathology is notable, particularly in parasitic infections. For instance, in Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas disease), Proline is essential for survival under oxidative and thermal stress, and inhibiting its uptake is explored as a novel drug target, with studies developing transporter inhibitors to reduce parasite proliferation ( Frontiers | Targeting L-Proline Uptake as New Strategy for Anti-chagas Drug Development ). In cancer, increased Proline metabolism is observed in metastatic cell lines, correlating with invasiveness and resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting its role in tumor progression ( Proline Dehydrogenase - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ). Molecular Target/Interaction Description Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B Binds, affects protein folding, crucial for collagen structure. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A Binds, influences protein conformation, supports structural integrity. Proline dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial.

    "title": "Rapastinel",
    "url": "wiki/alone-rapastinel.html",
    "content": "Rapastinel Also known as: GLYX-13 Tetrapeptide with the amino acid sequence Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH2. Rapastinel failed to demonstrate efficacy in phase III clinical trials for MDD, as announced by Allergan on March 6, 2019. Positive allosteric modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are critical for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Unlike ketamine, which blocks NMDARs, Rapastinel enhances NMDAR activity through a novel binding domain independent of the glycine coagonist site. Acts as a weak coagonist with glutamate, facilitating NMDAR-mediated signal transduction. This mechanism is believed to underlie its potential antidepressant effects by promoting long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhancing synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Detailed pharmacological studies indicate that Rapastinel does not bind to the NMDAR glycine site, with 0% displacement observed at 30 μM, suggesting a high-affinity site near the amino terminal-ligand binding interface. Critical amino acids, such as R392E in NR2A and R393E in NR2B, are essential for its effects, and their mutation abolishes Rapastinel’s activity. In preclinical models, Rapastinel’s brain concentrations associated with antidepressant-like efficacy range from 30 to 100 nM. A dose of 10 mg/kg results in approximately 30 nM, while 30 mg/kg achieves about 100 nM. Pharmacokinetic data show a Tmax of approximately 20 minutes and a half-life of about 20 minutes in the extracellular fluid, indicating rapid distribution and clearance. Pharmacodynamics NMDAR Subtype Modulation: Rapastinel enhances [3H] MK-801 binding in HEK cells expressing NR2A-D subtypes with the following EC50 values: NR2A: 9.8 pM NR2B: 9.9 nM NR2C: 2.2 pM NR2D: 1.7 pM In comparison, glycine has EC50 values ranging from 100 to 350 nM for these subtypes, highlighting Rapastinel’s higher potency at certain NMDAR subtypes. Calcium Mobilization: At concentrations of 10 to 300 nM, Rapastinel enhances NMDA-induced calcium influx by approximately 30%. At concentrations ≥1 μM, it inhibits calcium influx by about 25%. The EC50 for NMDA is 2.8 μM, and for D-serine, it is 290 nM, indicating its modulatory effects on calcium signaling pathways. Electrophysiological Effects: In rat mPFC slices, 100 nM Rapastinel increases NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and enhances the magnitude of LTP, with the effect being maximal at 100 nM and reduced at 1 μM. It does not affect paired-pulse facilitation or miniature EPSCs, suggesting a postsynaptic action. This enhancement is linked to increased synaptic plasticity, potentially contributing to its antidepressant effects. Comparison to Ketamine: Unlike ketamine, which inhibits NMDARs with an IC50 of approximately 1.0 μM and 98% displacement at the MK-801 site, Rapastinel enhances NMDAR activity. Additionally, Rapastinel does not affect presynaptic glutamate release, a mechanism observed with ketamine, further distinguishing its pharmacological profile. Clinical Trials Phase II Trial: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study involved 116 patients with MDD who had not responded to at least one biogenic amine antidepressant. Patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of Rapastinel at 1, 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg or placebo. The results, published by Preskorn et al. in 2015, showed that doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D17) from day 1 to day 7, with an onset of action within 2 hours as assessed by the Bech-6 subscale ( source ). No psychotomimetic or significant side effects were reported, and the effect was maintained for an average of 7 days. Phase III Trials: Despite the promising phase II results, multiple phase III studies failed to demonstrate efficacy. Three trials involving a total of 1,510 patients with MDD who had a partial response to antidepressant therapy were conducted. In two studies totaling 872 patients, participants received weekly IV injections of 450 mg Rapastinel or placebo in addition to their oral antidepressants. A third study with 638 participants included a third treatment arm of 225 mg Rapastinel weekly. The primary endpoint was the change in scores on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline at the end of three weeks. In all three trials, Rapastinel did not significantly differ from placebo, as reported in March 2019 ( source ). This failure raised questions about its clinical utility, despite earlier promise. Safety and Tolerability In the phase II trial, Rapastinel was well tolerated, with no reports of psychotomimetic effects or other significant side effects, distinguishing it from ketamine, which is known for such side effects. In phase III trials, Rapastinel was also found to be well tolerated, but its lack of efficacy over placebo limited its clinical advancement. Additional studies, such as a randomized trial assessing effects on driving performance, showed that single doses of 900 or 1800 mg did not impair driving compared to placebo, further supporting its safety profile ( source ). Preclinical studies provided insights into Rapastinel’s effects on synaptic plasticity. It increases dendritic spines 24 hours post-treatment in the rat dentate gyrus and layer V of the mPFC, enhances LTP, and reduces long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. It also facilitates metaplasticity processes, differing from NMDA receptor antagonists. The BDNF-TrkB-mTOR signaling pathway in the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray is required for its antidepressant effects, and genetic deletion of GluN2B from excitatory neurons in the mPFC blocks these effects, highlighting cell-type specificity ( source )."

    "url": "wiki/alone-resiquimod.html",
    "content": "Resiquimod Availability in Oral Form Research indicates that Resiquimod is not currently available in oral form for general use. While it has been investigated in clinical trials for oral administration, particularly for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, these studies did not lead to approval for oral use. For instance, a phase IIa study published in 2007 explored oral Resiquimod at doses of 0.01 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks, but it was associated with adverse effects similar to interferon-alpha, such as fever and lymphopenia ( source ). Regulatory data from the FDA's Orphan Drug Designations page, updated as of recent reports, shows Resiquimod has a designation for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma since May 24, 2017, but it is not FDA-approved for this indication, and the form is not specified as oral ( source ), it seems unlikely that oral Resiquimod is available for public use as of June 29, 2025. Clinical Trials and Safety Concerns The clinical trials for oral Resiquimod, particularly for HCV, provide insight into its safety profile. The 2007 study mentioned above noted that while a 0.01 mg/kg dose was tolerated, the 0.02 mg/kg dose led to severe adverse events, including systemic cytokine induction symptoms like fever, headache, and shivering, leading to discontinuation in some cases ( source ). These findings suggest that oral administration is not pursued further due to safety concerns. For other conditions, such as genital herpes, phase III trials of topical Resiquimod were suspended due to lack of efficacy, and there is no recent evidence of renewed interest in oral forms ( source ). The evidence leans toward oral Resiquimod being unsafe for general use, especially given the lack of approval and the adverse effects observed in trials. Recommendations for Use Given the evidence, it is not recommended to take Resiquimod orally outside of controlled clinical trial settings. The adverse effects observed in trials, combined with the lack of approval, suggest potential risks that outweigh benefits for lay use. For medical advice, consulting a healthcare provider is essential, especially considering individual health conditions and the specific indications for Resiquimod. Resiquimod, also known as R-848, is an immune response modifier classified as a potent agonist for Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/TLR8). Its pharmacological profile and clinical applications have been extensively studied, particularly for antiviral and antitumor activities. This note provides a detailed examination of its pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, dosages, and safety profiles, based on available literature as of June 27, 2025. Pharmacological Actions Resiquimod's primary mechanism involves activating TLR7 and TLR8, which are endosomal pattern recognition receptors critical for antiviral immune responses. This activation triggers the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF). Consequently, it induces the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and type I interferons (IFN-α), which are essential for enhancing innate and adaptive immunity. Specific pharmacological actions include: Cytokine Induction: Resiquimod significantly increases levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-α, as noted in studies on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( source ). Immune Cell Activation: It activates dendritic cells, macrophages, and other immune cells, promoting antigen presentation and T-cell activation, which is beneficial for antiviral and antitumor responses ( source ). Antiviral Activity: Demonstrated efficacy against viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus, with studies showing reduced viral loads in clinical trials ( source ). Antitumor Activity: Used in treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and other skin cancers, with potential as an adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy, enhancing tumor-associated macrophage stimulation ( source ). Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data for Resiquimod is limited, particularly for half-life and bioavailability, but available studies provide insights into its absorption and systemic exposure: Topical Application: Studies indicate low systemic absorption, with systemic exposure less than 1% of the applied dose in humans, assessed by urinary recovery, and approximately 8.5% in rats, as reported in a randomized, single-blind study ( source ). Oral Administration: In a phase IIa study for chronic HCV infection, oral doses of 0.01 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg resulted in mean maximum serum concentrations of 3.82 ± 1.47 ng/mL and 7.55 ± 4.17 ng/mL, respectively, administered twice weekly for 4 weeks ( source ). However, specific half-life and bioavailability data were not detailed in accessible literature, with moderate oral bioavailability suggested (26.5 ± 7.84%) in some references, though not universally confirmed. The lack of precise half-life data indicates a gap in current research, with estimates potentially ranging from 2-3 hours based on related studies, but this requires further validation. Dosages Dosage regimens vary by administration route and therapeutic intent: Topical Use: Commonly applied as a gel, with concentrations such as 0.01% for genital herpes and 0.03-0.06% for actinic keratosis (AK), covering up to 100 cm², with dosing frequencies adjusted based on tolerability (e.g., 3 times weekly, escalating to daily) ( source ). Oral Use: In the HCV study, doses of 0.01 mg/kg were tolerated, while 0.02 mg/kg led to increased adverse events, suggesting a minimum effective dose around 0.01 mg/kg and a maximum safe dose likely below 0.02 mg/kg, though exact ranges are not standardized ( source ). Safe Range, Minimum Effective Dose, and Maximum Safe Dose: Safe Range: Topical use appears safe with low systemic absorption, while oral use at 0.01 mg/kg is generally tolerated, with 0.02 mg/kg showing increased risk. Minimum Effective Dose: Likely 0.01 mg/kg orally for systemic effects, and 0.01% gel topically for local effects. Maximum Safe Dose: Oral administration at 0.02 mg/kg showed adverse effects, suggesting this as an upper limit, but precise maximum without high risks is unclear. LD50 and Danger Threshold: Specific LD50 values were not found, indicating a lack of comprehensive toxicity studies in public domains. For topical use, low systemic absorption suggests minimal risk of systemic toxicity, while oral use at higher doses (e.g., 0.02 mg/kg) is associated with systemic cytokine induction and adverse effects, potentially starting to become dangerous at doses exceeding this, though exact thresholds are not established. Detailed Safety and Toxicity Profile Toxicity data is sparse, with literature emphasizing local reactions for topical use (e.g., erythema, induration) and systemic effects for oral use (e.g., fever, lymphopenia). The ResearchGate PDF notes that topical 0.01% gel is unlikely to cause systemic toxicity due to low absorption, while oral capsules cause systemic cytokine induction, suggesting potential toxicity at higher doses ( source ). No LD50 values were identified, highlighting a research gap in systemic toxicity assessments. Parameter Value Route Notes Systemic Exposure (Topical) <1% of applied dose Topical Based on urinary recovery in humans Absorption (Topical, Rats) ~8.5% Topical From animal studies Cmax (Oral, 0.01 mg/kg) 3.82 ± 1.47 ng/mL Oral From HCV study Cmax (Oral, 0.02 mg/kg) 7.55 ± 4.17 ng/mL Oral From HCV study Bioavailability (Oral, Est.) Moderate, 26.5 ± 7.84% (not confirmed) Oral Suggested, needs validation Dosage Type Dose Range Safety Notes Topical (Gel) 0.01-0.06% Safe, low systemic absorption, local reactions Oral (HCV Study) 0.01-0.02 mg/kg 0.01 mg/kg tolerated, 0.02 mg/kg adverse effects"

    "title": "Resveratrol (trans)",
    "url": "wiki/alone-resveratrol-trans.html",
    "content": "Resveratrol (trans) Pharmacological Actions Trans-Resveratrol exhibits a plethora of biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. These actions are mediated through various mechanisms, such as scavenging free radicals, inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, improving endothelial function, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes like β-amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. For instance, studies have shown it can reduce oxidative stress by acting as an efficient scavenger of hydroperoxyl radicals and protect cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage ( source ). The user's request for \"values for each of time to know how each pharmacological action influences\" is somewhat ambiguous, but it likely refers to the time course of these effects, which is tied to its pharmacokinetics. Specific time-dependent values for each action are not universally standardized, as they depend on the condition and study design. However, the pharmacokinetic profile, such as time to peak concentration and half-life, provides insight into the duration and onset of these effects. Pharmacokinetic Parameters The pharmacokinetics of trans-Resveratrol are well-documented, with key parameters including: Time to Peak Concentration (Tmax): Research indicates that after oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached between 0.8 and 1.5 hours, depending on the dose and formulation. For example, a study with doses ranging from 0.5 g to 5 g showed peak times within this range ( source ). Half-Life (t1/2): The half-life varies based on dosing regimen. For single doses, it ranges from 1 to 3 hours, while with repeated dosing, it extends to 2 to 5 hours, reflecting potential accumulation and altered metabolism. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, less than 1%, due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, where it is rapidly conjugated into glucuronides and sulfates. Intravenous administration, however, achieves 100% bioavailability, though this route is less common in clinical settings, but standard bioavailability remains low. ( source ) Other routes, such as intraperitoneal in animal studies, are not typically relevant for human administration, so the focus remains on oral and intravenous routes. Dosage and Safety Profile Dosage recommendations and safety margins are critical for practical application: Typical Supplement Doses: Commonly available supplements range from 100 mg to 1 g per day, reflecting typical usage for health benefits like cardiovascular support and anti-aging effects ( source ). Studied Doses in Clinical Trials: Clinical trials have explored a wide range, from 8 mg/day for certain cardiovascular effects to as high as 5 g/day, with no marked toxicity reported at the higher end ( source ). Safe Range: Studies suggest that doses up to 5 g per day are generally well-tolerated, with side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain reported at higher doses, typically above 1 g/day. These effects are generally mild and reversible. ( source ) Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose varies by condition. For example, a meta-analysis found cardiovascular benefits at doses as low as 10 mg/day, while diabetes management often requires 300 mg/day. This variability underscores the need for condition-specific dosing. ( source ) Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Based on clinical data, up to 5 g per day appears safe, with no severe adverse effects reported, though gastrointestinal issues may occur at the higher end ( source ). LD50 and Acute Toxicity: The LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of subjects) is not readily available in the literature, which suggests low acute toxicity. Animal studies, such as those in rats and mice, use high doses (e.g., 50 mg/kg/day) without reporting lethality, indicating a wide safety margin. For zebrafish, LD50 values of 51.4-75.3 mg/L are reported for aquatic toxicity, but these are not directly comparable to oral mammalian toxicity. ( source ) Estimation of When It Becomes Too Dangerous: Given the lack of reported LD50 and the tolerance of high doses in humans (up to 5 g/day), it seems likely that significant danger would only arise at doses far exceeding this, potentially in the range of grams per kilogram, but specific thresholds are not established due to limited toxicity data. Comparative Analysis The user's query implies a comparison between \"Resveratrol (trans)\" and \"Resveratrol,\" which, given the context, likely refers to trans-Resveratrol versus the general term, potentially including cis-Resveratrol. Trans-Resveratrol is the dominant and biologically active form, with cis-Resveratrol being less stable and less studied. Literature consistently highlights trans-Resveratrol's superior bioavailability and efficacy, with no significant pharmacological actions attributed to cis-Resveratrol in comparison ( source ). Thus, the comparison is largely moot, as trans-Resveratrol encompasses the actions and parameters discussed."

    "content": "Resveratrol Pharmacological Actions Resveratrol exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological actions, primarily due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and modulatory effects on cellular pathways. Below is a detailed list of its key actions, with insights into how they influence health: Antioxidant Effects: Resveratrol acts as a free radical scavenger, reducing oxidative stress, which is implicated in aging and chronic diseases. It enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes, protecting cells from oxidative damage. Anti-inflammatory Effects: It inhibits pro-inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and reduces levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), potentially alleviating conditions like arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Cardioprotective Effects: Research suggests resveratrol improves endothelial function, reduces blood pressure, and has anti-atherosclerotic properties, possibly by enhancing nitric oxide production and inhibiting platelet aggregation. Neuroprotective Effects: It may protect against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, potentially through sirtuin activation. Anticancer Effects: Resveratrol induces apoptosis in cancer cells, inhibits cell proliferation, and suppresses angiogenesis, showing promise in preventing and treating various cancers, though human evidence is limited. Anti-diabetic Effects: It enhances insulin sensitivity and improves glucose metabolism, potentially benefiting type 2 diabetes management by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Anti-obesity Effects: Resveratrol reduces fat accumulation and promotes lipolysis, possibly aiding weight management by inhibiting adipogenesis. Antimicrobial Effects: It exhibits antibacterial activity against pathogens like Listeria and Staphylococcus aureus, and antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus, by disrupting cellular energy production. The effective doses for these actions vary widely, often ranging from 100 mg to 2 grams daily in human studies, depending on the condition and study design. For instance, a meta-analysis found that doses of 150 mg/day or more effectively lowered systolic blood pressure (source: medicalnewstoday.com ), while anticancer effects have been studied at doses up to 5 grams daily, with mixed results. Half-Life and Bioavailability The pharmacokinetics of resveratrol are characterized by rapid metabolism, affecting its half-life and bioavailability. Studies indicate: Half-life: The half-life of free resveratrol is approximately 1-5 hours, with variations depending on the study. For example, a bioavailability study reported a mean half-life of 5.114 hours for free resveratrol after a 500 mg oral dose (source: en.wikipedia.org ). Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, less than 1%, due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, involving glucuronidation and sulfation. Despite this, absorption is high, estimated at 70-75%, as shown in a study where a 25 mg oral dose achieved at least 70% absorption (source: pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). This discrepancy highlights the challenge of delivering effective concentrations systemically. Dosages and Safety Profile Dosage recommendations for resveratrol are not universally standardized, with variations based on intended use, individual tolerance, and study outcomes. Key details include: Supplement Dosages: Commercial supplements typically contain 250-500 mg per serving, reflecting common market availability (source: webmd.com ). Study Dosages: Clinical trials have explored a wide range, from 100 mg daily for 12 weeks in breast cancer marker studies to 5 grams daily in multiple myeloma patients, with the latter showing minimal efficacy and adverse events (source: drugs.com ). Safe Range: Literature suggests that up to 1 gram per day is generally safe for healthy adults, with no serious adverse effects reported in trials lasting up to 29 days (source: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition; for example, 150 mg/day has been effective for lowering systolic blood pressure (source: medicalnewstoday.com ), while higher doses (1-2 grams/day) have been used for insulin sensitivity improvements. Maximum Safe Dose: Doses above 2.5 grams daily are associated with gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, as reported in clinical trials (source: webmd.com ). LD50 and Toxicity: The lethal dose 50 (LD50) is not well-defined for humans, but animal studies provide insight. In rats, doses up to 3000 mg/kg for 28 days showed adverse effects like renal toxicity but no mortality, suggesting LD50 > 3000 mg/kg (source: 2013.igem.org ), indicating low acute toxicity. High doses in humans (>5 grams/day) have shown adverse events, such as hypersensitivity and elevated liver enzymes, in some trials. Detailed Pharmacokinetic and Safety Considerations To organize the pharmacokinetic data, the following table summarizes key parameters from human studies: Parameter Value Notes Half-life (Free) 1-5 hours Varies by study; likely reflects elimination phase, with initial phase shorter. Half-life (Metabolites) 7-9 hours Longer persistence due to conjugation. Oral Absorption 70-75% High absorption despite low bioavailability. Oral Bioavailability <1% Due to rapid glucuronidation and sulfation in liver and intestines. Cmax (500 mg dose) 71.2 ng/ml (free) Peak concentration for free resveratrol, low due to metabolism. Tmax 1.3 hours (free) Time to peak concentration for free resveratrol. For dosage safety, another table outlines the dosage ranges and associated effects: Dosage Range Effect Notes 100-150 mg/day Potentially effective for blood pressure Supported by meta-analysis for systolic pressure reduction. 250-500 mg/day Common supplement dose, generally well-tolerated Typical in commercial products, few adverse effects reported. 1-2 grams/day Used in studies for metabolic effects May improve insulin sensitivity, but data mixed. >2.5 grams/day Increased risk of side effects Gastrointestinal issues like nausea, diarrhea reported. >5 grams/day Potential serious adverse events Seen in some trials, e.g., hypersensitivity, elevated liver enzymes."

    "content": "Safinamide Mesylate Pharmacological Actions and Potencies Reversible Inhibition of Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B): Safinamide acts as a selective and reversible inhibitor of MAO-B, an enzyme responsible for dopamine degradation. This action increases dopamine levels in the brain, enhancing dopaminergic activity. The IC50 for MAO-B inhibition is consistently reported as 98 nM, with a selectivity ratio over MAO-A of approximately 5918-fold, indicated by an MAO-A IC50 of 580 μM. This high selectivity reduces the risk of hypertensive crises associated with non-selective MAO inhibitors. Blockade of Voltage-Dependent Sodium Channels: Safinamide also blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, with a noted IC50 of 8 μM at depolarized potentials and 262 μM at resting potentials. This use- and frequency-dependent blockade suggests a preference for active neuronal states, potentially contributing to its effects on neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. Blockade of N-Type Calcium Channels: The drug is known to block N-type calcium channels, a subtype critical for neurotransmitter release. However, specific IC50 values for this action were not found in the reviewed literature, indicating a gap in detailed potency data. This mechanism likely contributes to its neuroprotective effects by modulating calcium-dependent processes. Inhibition of Glutamate Release: Safinamide inhibits glutamate release, with an IC50 of 8 μM, which may be a downstream effect of its sodium and calcium channel blockade. This action is particularly relevant in Parkinson's disease, where excessive glutamatergic activity can exacerbate motor symptoms and contribute to neuronal damage. Pharmacokinetic Properties Half-Life: The terminal half-life ranges from 20 to 26 hours, allowing for sustained effects and steady-state concentrations achieved within 5-6 days of consistent dosing. This duration supports its use in maintaining therapeutic levels over extended periods. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is reported at 95%, with no significant first-pass metabolism. Food slightly delays the time to maximum concentration (Tmax, 2-3 hours) but does not affect the area under the curve (AUC) or maximum concentration (Cmax), ensuring reliable absorption. Distribution and Metabolism: The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is approximately 165 L, with an unbound fraction of 11-12%. Metabolism primarily occurs via non-microsomal cytosolic amidases and minor CYP3A4 activity, producing inactive metabolites like NW-1689 (161% parent exposure), NW-1689 AG (18%), and NW-1153 (11%). Excretion is predominantly renal (76%), with 5% excreted unchanged. Special Populations: No significant effects on pharmacokinetics were noted for age, race, sex, or renal impairment. However, hepatic impairment increases exposure, with mild impairment raising AUC by 30% and moderate by 80%, necessitating dosage adjustments (maximum 50 mg/day in moderate hepatic impairment, contraindicated in severe). Dosage and Safety Considerations Recommended Dosage Range: The standard dosage is 50-100 mg once daily, initiated at 50 mg and potentially increased after two weeks based on individual response and tolerability. Dosages above 100 mg daily have not shown additional benefits and may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions, particularly in the context of MAO-B inhibition. Minimum Effective Dose: Clinical studies, such as the SETTLE and MOTION trials, indicate that 50 mg/day is effective, improving ON-time without troublesome dyskinesias and motor function, making it the minimum effective dose. Maximum Safe Dose: The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg/day, as higher doses are not advised due to potential increased adverse effects without therapeutic gain. This is supported by pharmacodynamic data showing no additional benefit and increased risk at higher doses. LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds: Specific LD50 values for Safinamide were not found in public literature, and there is no human experience with overdose reported. Preclinical toxicology data from the EMA assessment report indicate adverse effects at high doses in animals (e.g., convulsions at ≥70 mg/kg/day in monkeys, hepatotoxicity at NOAEL 45 mg/kg/day in rats), but these do not translate directly to human LD50. Overdose symptoms, as noted in clinical observations, include hypertension, hallucinations, and dyskinesia, with no specific antidote available, requiring supportive care and dietary tyramine restriction for several weeks post-overdose. When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Doses exceeding 100 mg/day are considered potentially dangerous, as they increase the risk of adverse effects without additional benefit, based on clinical trial data and regulatory guidance. However, exact thresholds for severe toxicity are not well-defined due to limited overdose data. Summary of Pharmacological and Pharmacokinetic Parameters Parameter Value MAO-B Inhibition IC50 98 nM MAO-A Inhibition IC50 580 μM Sodium Channel Blockade IC50 8 μM (depolarized), 262 μM (resting) Calcium Channel Blockade IC50 Not available Glutamate Release Inhibition IC50 8 μM Half-Life 20-26 hours Oral Bioavailability 95% Recommended Dosage Range 50-100 mg/day Minimum Effective Dose 50 mg/day Maximum Safe Dose 100 mg/day LD50 Not available"

    "title": "SAMe",
    "url": "wiki/alone-same.html",
    "content": "SAMe Also known as: S-adenosyl-L-methionine and AdoMet Pharmacological Actions Depression: SAMe is implicated in enhancing neurotransmitter activity, particularly dopamine and serotonin turnover, which may improve mood regulation. Research indicates it increases levels of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, lowers serum prolactin, and impacts the noradrenergic system by modifying adrenergic receptor activity. It enhances methylation of catecholamines, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, and may boost gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), potentially supporting neurogenesis. Clinical effects often take weeks to manifest, with studies suggesting improvements noticeable after 4-12 weeks at doses of 200-1600 mg/day, though individual response times vary. Osteoarthritis: SAMe appears to support joint health by stimulating the production of collagen and proteoglycans, key components of cartilage. It also exhibits painkilling and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially reducing joint pain and stiffness. Mechanisms may include reducing inflammatory mediators, increasing glutathione levels, and signaling cartilage synthesis or survival, though exact pathways are not fully elucidated. Studies suggest benefits may be seen after several weeks, with doses of 600-1200 mg/day used for up to 84 days, showing gradual improvements in functional limitations and pain. Liver Disease: SAMe plays a critical role in liver health, acting as a precursor for glutathione, which enhances antioxidant defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS). It attenuates pro-inflammatory TNFα-mediated liver injury, induces anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, and protects hepatocytes from apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial cytochrome-c release and caspase-3 activation. It also influences membrane fluidity and bile salt export, aiding in conditions like intra-hepatic cholestasis. Clinical trials, such as a multi-center study with 220 patients at 1600 mg/day, showed symptom improvement within weeks, with effects on cholestasis indices noted early in treatment. Pharmacokinetic Properties Half-life: The half-life for intravenous administration is approximately 80-100 minutes, based on studies with doses like 100 mg, 500 mg, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight. For oral administration, the apparent half-life may be longer due to absorption dynamics, with some studies reporting values around 7.77-16.01 hours for novel formulations, suggesting variability based on formulation and absorption rate. This discrepancy highlights the need for further research into oral pharmacokinetics. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is notably low, estimated at 1-3% for standard formulations, attributed to poor intestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism in the liver. Novel formulations, such as enteric-coated tablets (e.g., MSI-195), can increase bioavailability to around 9%, as seen in pharmacokinetic studies comparing AUC ratios. Intramuscular bioavailability is higher, at 80-90%, offering a more efficient route for systemic exposure. The presence of food can reduce absorption, with studies showing a 55% reduction in AUC when taken with food compared to fasted states. Dosage and Safety Considerations Dosage Ranges: Safe Range: Clinical studies commonly use doses up to 1600 mg/day, with evidence suggesting safety for periods up to two years in conditions like alcohol-related liver disease. Doses are typically divided, taken with or without food, though absorption may be better on an empty stomach. Minimum Effective Dose: This varies by condition. For depression, studies start at 200 mg/day, escalating to 1600 mg/day for non-responders. For osteoarthritis, effective doses range from 600-1200 mg/day, and for liver disease, 800-1200 mg/day is common, based on trial data. Maximum Safe Dose: While 1600 mg/day is well-tolerated, higher doses lack extensive safety data. Given mild side effects at higher doses, caution is advised beyond this, especially without medical supervision. Toxicity and LD50: Animal studies provide insight into acute toxicity, with an oral LD50 in rats greater than 4650 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity. Human data on LD50 is unavailable due to ethical constraints, but studies at 1600 mg/day show no significant toxic methylated metabolites or homocysteine elevation, suggesting a wide safety margin. Chronic toxicity is less studied, but long-term use at therapeutic doses shows mild side effects like gastrointestinal upset, headache, and insomnia, particularly at higher doses. Onset of Danger: Determining when SAMe becomes dangerous is complex. High doses may exacerbate side effects, and in vulnerable populations, such as those with bipolar disorder, even therapeutic doses (e.g., 200-1600 mg/day) can trigger mania, as noted in case reports. The risk increases with pre-existing conditions, and individual sensitivity varies, necessitating medical oversight for high-dose regimens. Comparative Table of Pharmacokinetic and Dosage Parameters Parameter Details Half-life (IV) 80-100 minutes Half-life (Oral, Approx) 7.77-16.01 hours (varies by formulation) Bioavailability (Oral) 1-3% (standard), up to 9% (novel formulations) Bioavailability (IM) 80-90% Safe Dosage Range Up to 1600 mg/day, divided doses Minimum Effective Dose 200-600 mg/day, depending on condition LD50 (Rat, Oral) >4650 mg/kg"

    "content": "Selenium In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium). The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. The thyroid gland and every cell that uses thyroid hormone also use selenium,[117] which is a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine. Increased dietary selenium reduces the effects of mercury toxicity.

    "title": "Serine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-serine.html",
    "content": "Serine Pharmacological Actions of L-Serine L-serine exhibits a range of pharmacological actions, primarily centered on the nervous system and immune function: Neuroprotective Effects: L-serine is crucial for protecting neurons from damage. It mitigates neurotoxicity through the activation of glycine receptors and upregulation of PPAR-γ, a nuclear receptor involved in inflammation and metabolism. This action helps reduce neuronal damage in conditions like stroke and neurodegenerative diseases ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Anti-inflammatory Effects: It reduces neuroinflammation by downregulating the proliferation of microglia and astrocytes, which are immune cells in the brain, and decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. This anti-inflammatory property is vital for managing conditions like multiple sclerosis and brain injuries ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Neurotransmitter Synthesis: L-serine serves as a precursor to glycine and D-serine, which are essential for excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. This process is critical for long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity, underpinning learning and memory. Its role in neurotransmitter synthesis makes it a potential target for cognitive enhancement ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Immune Modulation: Through mTOR signaling, L-serine supports the proliferation and function of immune cells, such as natural killer cells (enhancing IFN-γ production) and neutrophils (supporting IL-17/IL-22 production). This immunomodulatory effect could be beneficial in conditions requiring immune support, such as chronic fatigue syndrome ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Circadian Rhythm Regulation: L-serine influences the circadian clock, particularly through its effects on the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the brain's master clock. This action may regulate sleep-wake cycles, offering potential benefits for insomnia and related disorders ( Serine - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ). Metabolic Roles: Beyond neurological effects, L-serine is involved in one-carbon metabolism, providing intermediates for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions. It is also a building block for phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids, critical components of cell membranes. These roles suggest potential impacts on metabolic disorders like diabetes and steatohepatitis, though more research is needed ( Dietary serine supplementation: Friend or foe? - ScienceDirect ). Pharmacological Actions of D-Serine D-serine, derived from L-serine via serine racemase, has distinct pharmacological actions, primarily in the nervous system: NMDA Receptor Co-agonist: D-serine acts as a co-agonist at the glycine site of NMDA receptors, which are crucial for excitatory neurotransmission. This action is vital for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, making D-serine a target for cognitive and psychiatric research ( Serine - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics ). Therapeutic Potential in Schizophrenia: D-serine is being studied for its role in improving symptoms of schizophrenia when used alongside standard antipsychotic therapy. It enhances NMDA receptor function, potentially alleviating negative symptoms, though it is less effective when used alone ( SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews ). Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease: Recent studies suggest D-serine levels in cerebrospinal fluid may serve as a biomarker for early Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, highlighting its role in neurodegenerative processes ( Serine - Wikipedia ). Therapeutic Uses and Clinical Applications Both forms of serine are under investigation for various therapeutic uses, with L-serine showing broader application: L-Serine Therapeutic Uses: Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1 (HSAN1): Supplementation at 400 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks reduced neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids, improving neurological outcomes ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): A phase I trial demonstrated safety, with no contribution to disease progression rate, and a phase II trial is planned ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Severe Encephalopathy (GRIN2B-related): Improved motor, cognitive performance, and communication after 11 and 17 months at doses like 500 mg/kg/day in pediatric cases ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Rescued cognitive deficits in AD mouse models, outperforming D-cycloserine in passive avoidance tests, suggesting potential for human trials ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Investigational Uses: Ongoing research for Parkinson’s Disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, driven by its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties ( L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential ). Safety Profile and Dosage Considerations The safety of serine supplementation varies by form and dose: L-Serine Safety: Commonly consumed in foods, with a typical dietary intake of 3.5-8 grams daily. It is possibly safe at higher doses, up to 25 grams daily for up to 1 year, with side effects like upset stomach and bloating. Very high doses (25 grams or more daily) may lead to increased stomach issues and seizures, making it possibly unsafe ( SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews ). D-Serine Safety: Doses of 2-4 grams daily for up to 4 weeks have been used safely, but higher doses (8 grams or more daily) may increase the risk of side effects, similar to L-serine ( SERINE: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews ). Affected Receptors and Actions The main targets are the transporters for serotonin (SERT), noradrenaline (NET), and dopamine (DAT). These are not traditional receptors but proteins that manage neurotransmitter levels. St. John's wort likely inhibits these transporters, preventing them from removing the neurotransmitters from the brain's communication spaces, thus increasing their availability. Affinities The binding strength, measured as IC50 values, is based on hyperforin, a key active compound in St. John's wort. Research suggests: Serotonin transporter: IC50 around 2.5 nM Noradrenaline transporter: IC50 around 10 nM Dopamine transporter: IC50 around 100 nM These values indicate how much of the compound is needed to block half of the transporter's activity, with lower numbers showing stronger binding. Additional Pharmacological Considerations While the primary focus is on neurotransmitter transporters, St. John's wort's pharmacology extends beyond these targets. For instance, it is a potent activator of the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR), leading to the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (notably CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein, which are crucial for drug metabolism and can result in significant herb-drug interactions ( Clinical relevance of St. John's wort drug interactions revisited - Nicolussi - 2020 - British Journal of Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library ). Additionally, other components like hypericin have been studied for antiviral and antibacterial properties, and there is some evidence suggesting interactions with GABA(A) receptors, though these are less central to its antidepressant effects ( In vitro binding studies with two Hypericum perforatum extracts - Hyperforin, hypericin and biapigenin - On 5-HT6, 5-HT7, GABAA/benzodiazepine, ... | ResearchGate ). Hyperforin has also been shown to activate transient receptor potential canonical C6 (TRPC6) channels, which may have roles in other physiological processes, but their relevance to depression is not well-established ( Hyperforin activates gene transcription involving transient receptor potential C6 channels - ScienceDirect ). Aspect L-Serine D-Serine Primary Mechanism Precursor to glycine and D-serine, activates glycine receptors, upregulates PPAR-γ Co-agonist at NMDA receptor glycine site, enhances glutamatergic transmission Neuroprotective Role Mitigates neurotoxicity, reduces brain lesion volume post-injury Supports synaptic plasticity, potentially protects against cognitive decline Anti-inflammatory Role Downregulates microglia/astrocyte proliferation, reduces proinflammatory cytokines Less direct, but may modulate inflammation via NMDA receptor activity Immune Effects Supports mTOR signaling, enhances NK cell and neutrophil function Minimal direct evidence, primarily neurological focus Therapeutic Focus HSAN1, ALS, encephalopathy, AD, PD, schizophrenia, epilepsy, MS Schizophrenia, potential AD biomarker"

    "title": "Shiitake",
    "url": "wiki/alone-shiitake.html",
    "content": "Shiitake Immune System Enhancement: Lentinan, a β-glucan, is known to stimulate the immune system, potentially aiding in slowing tumor growth and enhancing resistance to infections. Studies indicate it increases immune cell proliferation and activation, such as γδ-T cells and natural killer T (NK-T) cells, and boosts secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in saliva, as seen in a 2015 study involving daily consumption ( source ). Antiviral and Antibacterial Effects: Lentinan has shown antiviral effects against poliovirus type 1 and bovine herpes virus type 1, and antibacterial effects by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity and activating macrophage-mediated responses, according to research from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . Antifungal Properties: Shiitake extracts have demonstrated antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of certain fungal pathogens. Cancer-Related Effects: Lentinan does not directly kill cancer cells but enhances immune responses that may slow tumor growth. It has been studied for its potential to inhibit leukemic cell proliferation, suppress HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells via caspase-3 and -8 pathways. A clinical trial showed oral lentinan formulations extending survival in patients with stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers, though a Shiitake extract alone was ineffective for prostate cancer treatment. Immune Modulation: Shiitake alters immune function by increasing levels of cytokines like IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α, while decreasing MIP-1alpha/CCL3 levels, suggesting a less inflammatory state, as noted in immune studies. Antihypercholemic Effects: Eritadenine, a compound in Shiitake, regulates lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase and upregulating CYP7A1 mRNA, potentially lowering blood cholesterol. Studies in rats fed Shiitake showed reduced plasma cholesterol levels, attributed to both eritadenine and dietary fiber. Anti-Obesity Potential: High doses of Shiitake in rat studies prevented obesity by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver, suggesting a role in fat metabolism regulation. Other Effects: Shiitake inhibits lung cancer cells via the Latcripin-13 domain, suppresses cytochrome P450 1A enzymes, and increases serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, indicating broad pharmacological activity. Safe Dose Range Food Consumption: Shiitake mushrooms are generally considered safe when cooked and consumed in typical dietary amounts. Studies and dietary guidelines suggest a range of 50-200 grams per day for healthy adults, based on nutritional intake. For instance, a cup of cooked Shiitake (approximately 145 grams) provides significant nutrients like copper and selenium, and sources like Verywellfit suggest up to 2 cups (290 grams) for balanced diets, though this may be high for daily consumption. FreshCap Mushrooms notes three to eight mushrooms per day, which, at an average weight of 15-20 grams each, translates to 45-160 grams, aligning with this range ( source ). Medicinal Use: For medicinal purposes, such as extracts or dried forms, the safe dosage is less defined. A specific extract, AHCC (Active Hexose Correlated Compound), derived from Shiitake, is considered possibly safe at 4.5-6 grams daily for up to 6 months or 3 grams daily for up to 9 years, according to WebMD . Studies on dried Shiitake used doses of 5-10 grams daily, equivalent to about 50-100 grams fresh, showing immune benefits. However, using Shiitake in larger medicinal amounts or raw can be unsafe, potentially causing stomach discomfort, blood abnormalities, and skin reactions like shiitake dermatitis. Considerations: The literature emphasizes consulting healthcare professionals for medicinal use, especially for those with autoimmune diseases, as Shiitake may increase immune activity, potentially worsening conditions like multiple sclerosis or lupus. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should avoid medicinal amounts due to insufficient safety data. Given the variability, a safe dose range for food is likely 50-200 grams daily of cooked Shiitake, while medicinal doses should be guided by product labels or professional advice, typically 5-10 grams of dried extract daily based on studies. Safe Dose Range General Bioavailability: Research indicates that Shiitake’s active compounds, especially polysaccharides, have low oral bioavailability. Lentinan, a key β-glucan, is noted for poor systemic absorption due to its high molecular weight (400-800 kDa) and is often administered intraperitoneally in studies for better efficacy, as mentioned in Drugs.com , due to rapid metabolism and low oral bioavailability. This suggests that oral ingestion may not result in significant blood levels, with effects likely mediated through gut interactions. Gut Microbiome Interaction: Edible mushroom polysaccharides (EMPs) are resistant to human digestive enzymes and serve as energy sources for gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacteria growth, as per a PMC review . This implies that their bioactivity is more local, affecting gut immunity and microbiome composition rather than systemic circulation. Effect of Food (Empty vs. Full Stomach): There is no specific data on whether taking Shiitake on an empty stomach versus with food significantly alters bioavailability. Given that polysaccharides are not readily absorbed and act primarily in the gut, it seems likely that the presence of food would not substantially change absorption, as their effects are mediated through fermentation and immune modulation rather than systemic uptake. Commercial Claims: Some commercial products, like Hifas da Terra, claim enhanced bioavailability through extraction methods, but these are not backed by peer-reviewed studies for general Shiitake consumption. For instance, a French Mush X post mentions 92% bioavailability for their extracts, but this is a marketing claim without scientific validation. The safe dose range was inferred from both culinary consumption patterns (50-200 grams daily) and medicinal studies (5-10 grams dried). Aspect Details Pharmacology Actions Immune enhancement, antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, anti-obesity effects. Safe Dose Range 50-200 grams daily as food; 5-10 grams dried for medicinal use, consult professional. Oral Bioavailability Low for active compounds like lentinan; no clear difference with food intake."

This induction can lead to increased metabolism of co-administered medications, potentially reducing their efficacy. For instance, a 2009 PMC article by Izzo highlights that St. John's wort induces CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2C19, with no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9, and notes that the primary site is intestinal CYP3A4, with effects returning to baseline after about a week ( Herb–Drug Interactions with St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum): an Update on Clinical Observations ). This induction is particularly relevant for drugs like digoxin, where a 33.3% decrease in trough concentration and 25% reduction in area under the curve (AUC) have been observed after 10 days of St. John's wort use. Such interactions are crucial for patients, as they can lead to reduced effectiveness of medications like cyclosporine, ethinylestradiol, and others, especially with low hyperforin extracts showing weaker effects.

Indinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, may have reduced antiviral activity. Oral contraceptives may fail, increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy. Coumadin (warfarin) and digoxin levels may drop, affecting anticoagulation and heart function. Benzodiazepines, used for anxiety, may have diminished sedative effects."

    "content": "Threonine Research suggests that Threonine supplementation enhances hepatic lipid metabolism, reducing the risk of fat accumulation in the liver, which can lead to conditions like hepatic steatosis. Threonine deficiency can induce hepatic triglyceride accumulation, while supplementation exerts a protective effect by regulating lipogenesis signaling pathways and thermogenic gene expression. For example, a study on obese mice showed that Threonine supplementation restored decreased UCP1 expression, highlighting its potential in managing lipid metabolic disorders. Supplementing a Threonine-deficient diet in rats reduced liver fat accumulation, supporting the notion that adequate Threonine levels are crucial for preventing fatty liver ( Prevention of Fatty Liver due to Threonine Deficiency by Moderate Caloric Restriction | Nature ). Threonine's role in protein synthesis is fundamental, given its status as an essential amino acid. It is a building block for proteins, notably collagen, elastin, and enamel protein, which are critical for the structural integrity of connective tissues. This is evident from sources like Dr. Axe, which detail Threonine's involvement in forming the foundation of bones, muscles, and skin ( Threonine Benefits, Uses, Foods, Supplements and Side Effects - Dr. Axe ). The PMC review further elaborates that Threonine is required for synthesizing Threonine-rich proteins like mucins, with 71% of total Threonine usage in piglets dedicated to mucosal protein synthesis, underscoring its importance in tissue repair and maintenance. Threonine's impact on intestinal health is another significant pharmacological action, with high intestinal extraction rates (40–60% of dietary intake) used for mucosal protein synthesis and oxidation. The PMC article provides detailed insights, noting that Threonine maintains mucosa integrity, enhances villus height, and affects digestive enzyme synthesis, with specific demands like 11% of total protein for amylase synthesis in broilers. It also plays a role in gut microbiota, reducing pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli while increasing beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus, as seen in studies with dietary Threonine levels 26% above NRC recommendations. Moreover, Threonine supports immune function within the gut, comprising 7–11% of IgA and modulating cytokine expression via pathways like MAPK and TOR. For instance, it up-regulates IL-6 in piglets and affects mRNA expression of immune-related genes, suggesting a role in enhancing gastrointestinal immune responses ( Physiological Functions of Threonine in Animals: Beyond Nutrition Metabolism ). Threonine serves as a precursor to other amino acids, notably glycine and serine, which have their own physiological roles. This is highlighted in DrugBank, where it is noted that Threonine is changed in the body to glycine, potentially reducing muscle contractions, though evidence for clinical benefits is limited ( DrugBank Online: Threonine ). The Wikipedia entry also mentions its use in synthesizing glycine for L-carnitine production in the brain and liver, particularly in rats, indicating a broader metabolic role ( Threonine - Wikipedia ). While there is interest in Threonine's potential for neurological conditions like ALS and multiple sclerosis, current evidence does not strongly support its effectiveness. WebMD notes that taking Threonine by mouth does not slow ALS progression or reduce symptoms, and there is insufficient reliable information for other uses, suggesting a need for further research ( WebMD: Threonine ). An unexpected detail is Threonine's role in cell proliferation and epigenetic regulation, particularly in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The PMC review details that Threonine is necessary for the undifferentiated state and proliferation of mouse ESCs, with TDH mRNA levels 1000 times higher in ESCs than in differentiated cells. It also participates in histone methylation via Thr catabolism, maintaining the pluripotent state by affecting H3K4 di- and trimethylation, which could have implications for regenerative medicine and tissue repair.

    "title": "Tinidazole",
    "url": "wiki/alone-tinidazole.html",
    "content": "Tinidazole Pharmacological Actions and Temporal Influence Tinidazole’s primary pharmacological action is its antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity, achieved through the reduction of its nitro group by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system in organisms like Trichomonas vaginalis. This generates a free nitro radical that covalently binds to DNA, causing damage and leading to cell death. While the exact mechanism against Giardia and Entamoeba species is not fully known, it is likely similar. The influence over time is tied to its pharmacokinetics: Onset of Action: Research indicates a time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of approximately 1.6 hours under fasted conditions for a 2 g dose, suggesting the drug begins exerting effects shortly after administration. Duration of Action: With a half-life of 12-14 hours, Tinidazole maintains therapeutic levels for an extended period, supporting single-dose regimens for some infections like trichomoniasis (2 g once) and multi-day regimens for others, such as amebiasis (2 g/day for 3-5 days). The effectiveness over time is likely related to maintaining concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the target organisms, though specific MIC values vary by pathogen and are not detailed here. Half-Life and Bioavailability Half-Life: The elimination half-life is reported as 13.2 ± 1.4 hours, with a plasma half-life of 12-14 hours, indicating the drug’s persistence in the body. This long half-life supports less frequent dosing, enhancing patient compliance. Bioavailability: Tinidazole exhibits nearly 100% oral bioavailability, meaning it is almost completely absorbed when taken by mouth. Studies show that food does not affect overall bioavailability, though it delays Tmax by about 2 hours and reduces peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 10%, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 901.6 ± 126.5 mcg hr/mL at 72 hours for a 2 g dose under fasted conditions. This high bioavailability is consistent across formulations, including crushed tablets in cherry syrup, which show no pharmacokinetic differences compared to whole tablets. Other routes of administration are not commonly used, as Tinidazole is primarily available as oral tablets (250 mg and 500 mg), with no significant data on alternative routes in humans. Dosage Regimens Dosage varies by condition and patient age, with the following standard regimens: Condition Adult Dose Pediatric Dose (>3 years) Amebiasis (Intestinal) 2 g/day PO for 3 days 50 mg/kg/day PO for 3 days; max 2 g Amebic Liver Abscess 2 g/day PO for 3-5 days 50 mg/kg/day PO for 5 days; max 2 g Giardiasis 2 g PO once 50 mg/kg PO once; max 2 g Trichomoniasis 2 g PO once Safety and efficacy not established Bacterial Vaginosis 2 g PO qDay for 2 days OR 1 g PO qDay for 5 days Not applicable (adult women only) Minimum Effective Dose: For trichomoniasis, a single 2 g dose is effective, while for bacterial vaginosis, 1 g daily for 5 days is a lower effective regimen. Safe Range: Doses within the above guidelines are considered safe, typically up to 2 g/day for adults, with children’s doses capped at 2 g maximum based on weight. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Clinical data suggest doses up to 2 g/day are standard, with no specific data on higher doses in humans. Exceeding recommended doses is not advised due to potential toxicity, though exact thresholds are unclear. LD50 and Toxicity: In animal studies, LD50 values are >3,600 mg/kg oral in mice and >2,000 mg/kg in rats, indicating high doses are required for toxicity in animals. Human overdose data is limited, with no reported cases, and treatment is symptomatic and supportive, including gastric lavage and hemodialysis (removing ~43% in a 6-hour session). Estimation of Dangerous Levels: Given the lack of human overdose data, it is difficult to specify when Tinidazole becomes too dangerous. Caution is advised with doses exceeding recommended levels, especially in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, where metabolism and elimination may be affected. Safety Considerations Tinidazole is generally well-tolerated, with common side effects including metallic taste and nausea (9-11% of recipients). It crosses the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk, requiring caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. In patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 22 mL/min), pharmacokinetics are similar to healthy subjects, but hemodialysis reduces half-life to 4.9 hours, necessitating an additional half-dose post-session if administered pre-hemodialysis. For hepatic impairment, no specific pharmacokinetic data exists, but caution is advised due to potential reduced elimination, similar to metronidazole."

    "content": "Tongkat Ali Pharmacological Actions and Time to Effect Tongkat Ali, scientifically known as Eurycoma longifolia, is a traditional herbal medicine with a wide range of potential pharmacological effects, supported by both in vitro and in vivo studies. Below is a detailed breakdown, including the time it takes for each action to manifest, based on clinical and preclinical evidence: Male Fertility Enhancement: This action includes enhancing semen volume, spermatozoa count, and motility, as well as increasing testosterone production and improving erectile function and sexual libido. Studies show sperm motility increased by 44.4% and semen volume by 18.2% after 12 weeks of supplementation, with testosterone increases of 30.2% in rat models ( source ). Antimalarial Effect: Effective against Plasmodium falciparum, with IC50, IC90, and IC99 values for extract at 14.72, 139.65, and 874.15 μg/L respectively, compared to artemisinin at 4.30, 45.48, and 310.97 μg/L. Time to effect is not well-documented in humans, primarily studied in vitro ( source ). Cytotoxic and Anti-Proliferative Effects: Demonstrates cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines like A-549, MCF-7, and HeLa, with IC50 values for NF-κB inhibitors <1 μM and cell viability ranging from 21.01%–66.9% at 100 μM for HeLa cells. These effects are typically measured in vitro, with no specific time to effect in humans ( source ). Antimicrobial Effects: Active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, with inhibition zones of 7–25 mm and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 75 mg/mL for S. aureus and 25 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa. Time to effect is not specified, as it’s primarily an in vitro measure ( source ). Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Inhibits NF-κB with IC50 values <1 μM, activates Nrf2 via ROS-dependent p38 MAPK pathway, and shows antioxidant activity at 10–250 µg/mL. Time to effect in humans is not well-documented, but animal studies suggest rapid onset ( source ). Anti-Anxiolytic Effects: Reduces anxiety in mice, similar to diazepam, and improves stress hormone profiles in humans, with significant effects observed after 4 weeks in clinical trials ( source ). Antidiabetic Effects: Decreases blood glucose by 38%–47% at 150 mg/kg in hyperglycemic rats and enhances glucose uptake >200% at 50 μg/mL.

Osteoporosis Preventive Effects: Prevents bone calcium loss, stimulates osteoblast proliferation, and enhances testosterone levels, with no specific time to effect documented in humans, likely requiring chronic use ( source ). Miscellaneous Effects: Includes hormonal (anti-estrogenic), ergogenic (increases muscle strength), insecticidal, muscular, antiulcer, and anti-rheumatism effects. For ergogenic effects, benefits are seen after 5-8 weeks, with Cmax and Tmax for eurycomanone at 0.33 ± 0.03 mcg/mL and 4.40 ± 0.98 h, respectively ( source ). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Tongkat Ali, particularly for its active compounds like eurycomanone, are crucial for understanding its efficacy and safety. Below are the detailed parameters: Half-life: For eurycomanone, studies report a half-life of 0.35 ± 0.04 h in one study and 1.00 ± 0.26 h in another, suggesting variability possibly due to formulation or species ( source ). For 13α(21)-epoxy-eurycomanone, the half-life is 0.75 ± 0.25 h, longer due to lower elimination rate. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability for eurycomanone is 10.5%, with Cmax at 0.33 ± 0.03 mcg/mL and Tmax at 4.40 ± 0.98 h. For 9-methoxycanthin-6-one, absorption is <1% orally, indicating poor bioavailability for some compounds ( source ). Distribution and Excretion: Eurycomanone has a volume of distribution (V_d) of 0.68 ± 0.30 L/kg, well distributed in extravascular fluids, with an elimination rate constant (k_e) of 0.88 ± 0.19 h⁻¹ and clearance (CL) of 0.39 ± 0.08 L/h/kg ( source ). CYP Inhibition: Eurycomanone shows IC50 >250 μg/mL for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, indicating a low likelihood of drug-herb interactions ( source ). Dosage and Safety Dosage recommendations and safety profiles are critical for practical use. Below is a detailed table summarizing the dosage ranges, safety data, and toxicity information: Aspect Details General Dosing Range 100 to 800 mg daily, with specific uses like male infertility at 200 mg twice daily up to 3 months. ( source ) Safe Range Possibly safe at 200 mg daily for up to 9 months or 400 mg daily for 3 months ( source ) Minimum Effective Dose Often 100 mg daily for testosterone and muscle effects, varying by condition ( source ) Maximum Safe Dose Not clearly defined, but exceeding 800 mg daily is not recommended due to potential risks ( source ) LD50 In mice, LD50 for alcoholic extract is 1500-2000 mg/kg, and for aqueous extract >3000 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity ( source ) Risks at High Doses Potential for DNA damage and genotoxicity, with positive results in chromosome aberration tests at 500-2500 μg/mL and in vivo comet assays at 2000 mg/kg bw, particularly affecting stomach and duodenum ( source ) Side Effects Possible mercury or lead poisoning from contaminated supplements, presence of sildenafil in some products, and rare cases of liver injury, especially in bodybuilders ( source )"

    "content": "Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Pharmacological Actions and Temporal Influences TMP-SMX is an antimicrobial combination primarily used to treat and prevent bacterial infections by targeting folate synthesis, a critical pathway for bacterial DNA and protein synthesis. Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide, acts as a competitive inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthase, preventing the conversion of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to dihydropteroate, an early step in folate synthesis. Trimethoprim complements this by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, the active form needed for purine synthesis. This dual inhibition creates a synergistic effect, often rendering the combination bactericidal, particularly in environments like urine, where concentrations can be high. The pharmacodynamic profile suggests a time-dependent killing mechanism, akin to beta-lactams and macrolides, where efficacy is maximized by maintaining drug concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a significant portion of the dosing interval. This is supported by studies indicating that the duration of exposure, rather than peak concentration, correlates with bacterial kill rates. For instance, research on E. coli showed significant CFU reductions at concentrations above MIC for extended periods, with pharmacodynamic thresholds like fAUC/MIC ratios (e.g., 40.7 for stasis, 59.5 for 1-log reduction) highlighting the importance of time above MIC. Temporal influences include: Onset of Action: Peak blood levels occur 1-4 hours post-oral administration, with steady-state concentrations achieved after approximately 3 days of repeat dosing. Duration of Effect: Given the half-lives (6-12 hours for sulfamethoxazole, 8-10 hours for trimethoprim), dosing every 12 hours ensures adequate coverage, aligning with time-dependent killing requirements. Half-Life and Bioavailability The half-life of sulfamethoxazole ranges from 6 to 12 hours in healthy individuals, extending to 20-50 hours in renal failure due to reduced clearance. Trimethoprim has a half-life of 8-10 hours, which may prolong in renal dysfunction. These values are critical for dosing intervals to maintain therapeutic levels. Bioavailability is high for both components via the oral route: Sulfamethoxazole: Approximately 85-90%, with rapid absorption and distribution into various fluids like sputum, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. Trimethoprim: Close to 100%, as evidenced by studies in AIDS patients showing oral bioavailability of 102.7% ± 19.8%, suggesting near-complete absorption, with values over 100% likely due to measurement variability. Other routes, such as intravenous, are used in severe cases, but oral administration is standard due to high bioavailability, ensuring systemic efficacy. Dosage Regimens Dosage varies by indication, patient factors, and renal function, as detailed below: Indication Dosage (Adult, ≥40kg) Duration Bacterial Infections (e.g., UTI) 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP every 12 hours 10-14 days Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (Treatment) 75-100 mg/kg SMX + 15-20 mg/kg TMP daily, divided 14-21 days Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (Prophylaxis) 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP daily Continuous Traveler's Diarrhea 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP every 12 hours 5 days Chronic Bronchitis (Acute Exacerbation) 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP every 12 hours 10-14 days Shigellosis 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP every 12 hours 5 days Safe Range and Adjustments: Standard doses are generally safe for adults without comorbidities. For renal impairment, adjust as follows: CrCl >30 mL/min: No change. CrCl 15-30 mL/min: Reduce dose by 50%. CrCl <15 mL/min: Avoid use. Not recommended for infants <2 months due to toxicity risks like hyperbilirubinemia. Minimum Effective Dose: Depends on infection and bacterial susceptibility; prophylaxis uses lower doses (e.g., 800 mg SMX + 160 mg TMP daily or thrice weekly). Maximum Safe Dose: Up to 100 mg/kg SMX + 20 mg/kg TMP per day for severe infections, but increased monitoring is required due to higher adverse effect risks, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients. Toxicity and Safety Thresholds Toxicity data from animal studies provide insight into lethal doses: Trimethoprim LD50: >5300 mg/kg oral in rats. Sulfamethoxazole LD50: 2300 mg/kg in mice, 6200 mg/kg in rats. In humans, LD50 is not ethically determined, but therapeutic doses are significantly lower, with toxicity manifesting at standard doses in susceptible individuals. Common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, and skin rashes, while severe reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hematological toxicities like thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, particularly at higher doses or in patients with renal impairment. When It Becomes Too Dangerous: Toxicity becomes significant with signs like severe skin reactions, significant blood count drops, or hyperkalemia, necessitating immediate dose adjustment or discontinuation. Elderly patients, those with kidney issues, or those on interacting medications (e.g., diuretics, digoxin) are at higher risk, requiring careful monitoring."

    "content": "Umifenovir Pharmacological Actions Umifenovir is a dual direct-acting antiviral and host-targeting agent, primarily utilized for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory viral infections in Russia and China. Its pharmacological actions include: Antiviral Activity: Umifenovir inhibits the fusion of the viral lipid membrane with the host cell membrane, preventing viral entry. This is achieved by interacting with viral glycoproteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA), and the plasma membrane, interfering with clathrin-mediated exocytosis. It is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses, including influenza A and B, SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B and C, and others like Zika virus and Ebola virus, as demonstrated in vitro studies [DrugBank: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609 , ScienceDirect: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir ]. Immunomodulatory Effects: Beyond its antiviral properties, Umifenovir exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system. It stimulates the humoral immune response, induces interferon production, and enhances the phagocytic function of macrophages. These effects contribute to a strengthened immune defense, particularly noted in patients with lower baseline immunity, where improvements in CD4, CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and serum immunoglobulin levels have been observed [NCATS Inxight Drugs: https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/8CXV4OU367 ]. The onset of these actions is rapid, with pharmacokinetic data indicating peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved within 1.38 hours for a 200 mg dose, suggesting early antiviral and immune-modulating effects [PMC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/ ]. Pharmacokinetic Parameters The pharmacokinetic profile of Umifenovir is critical for understanding its clinical utility. Key parameters include: Half-Life (t₁/₂): The half-life ranges from 15.7 to 21 hours, with a study in healthy male Chinese volunteers reporting 15.7 ± 3.8 hours after a 200 mg oral dose, indicating a relatively slow elimination that supports twice-daily dosing in some regimens [PMC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/ , Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir ]. Bioavailability: Oral bioavailability is approximately 40%, meaning 40% of the administered dose is absorbed into systemic circulation, unaffected by food intake. This is consistent across multiple sources, ensuring reliable absorption for oral administration [Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir ]. Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax): For a 200 mg dose, Tmax is 1.38 ± 1.11 hours, with variations noted for lower doses (e.g., 1.2 hours for 50 mg, 1.5 hours for 100 mg), reflecting rapid absorption [PMC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/ , Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir ]. Maximum Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Curve (AUC): After a 200 mg oral dose, Cmax is 467 ± 174 ng/mL, and AUC_0-∞ is 2,203 ± 691 ng·h/mL, with linear increases observed with higher doses, supporting dose-dependent pharmacokinetics [PMC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623363/ ]. Metabolism and Excretion: Umifenovir is extensively metabolized, primarily by CYP3A4 and other hepatic enzymes, with 33 metabolites identified. About 40% is excreted unchanged, mainly via bile (38.9%) and minimally through kidneys (0.12%), with 90% eliminated within 24 hours [DrugBank: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609 ]. Dosage Guidelines Dosage varies by indication, age, and severity, with detailed regimens as follows: Purpose Age Group Dosage (mg) Frequency Duration Non-specific prophylaxis (contact with influenza/RSV) 2–7 years 50 Once daily 10–14 days 7–12 years 100 Once daily 10–14 days 12–adult 200 Once daily 10–14 days Prophylaxis during epidemics (influenza, RSV, chronic bronchitis, herpes) 2–7 years 50 Twice weekly 3 weeks 7–12 years 100 Twice weekly 3 weeks 12–adult 200 Twice weekly 3 weeks SARS prophylaxis (contact with SARS patients) 7–12 years 100 Once daily, before food 12–14 days 12–adult 200 Once daily, before food 12–14 days Prophylaxis against postoperative complications 2–7 years 50 48 hours before, then 2–5 days after procedure - 7–12 years 100 48 hours before, then 2–5 days after procedure - 12–adult 200 48 hours before, then 2–5 days after procedure - Treatment of influenza/RSV (uncomplicated) 2–7 years 50 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days 7–12 years 100 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days 12–adult 200 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days Treatment of influenza with complications (bronchitis, pneumonia) 2–7 years 50 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5 days, then once weekly 5 days initial, then 4 weeks 7–12 years 100 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5 days, then once weekly 5 days initial, then 4 weeks 12–adult 200 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5 days, then once weekly 5 days initial, then 4 weeks Treatment of SARS 12–adult 200 Twice daily 8–10 days Treatment of chronic bronchitis/herpes infections 2–7 years 50 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5–7 days, then twice weekly 5–7 days initial, then 4 weeks 7–12 years 100 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5–7 days, then twice weekly 5–7 days initial, then 4 weeks 12–adult 200 4 times daily (every 6 hours) for 5–7 days, then twice weekly 5–7 days initial, then 4 weeks Treatment of acute rotavirus intestinal infections Over 2 years 50 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days 7–12 years 100 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days Over 12 years 200 4 times daily (every 6 hours) 5 days Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose is not explicitly defined in literature, but prophylactic doses (e.g., 200 mg once daily) suggest efficacy at lower levels compared to treatment doses (800 mg/day for adults), indicating a dose-dependent response. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: Clinical use suggests 800 mg/day (200 mg four times daily) is standard and appears safe, with no significant adverse effects reported at this level. Animal studies support a large therapeutic window, with no pathological changes at doses up to 100 times human therapeutic levels [DrugBank: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609 ]. LD50 and Toxicity: The oral LD50 in mice is 340-400 mg/kg, and in rats, it is >3000 mg/kg, indicating high doses are required for toxicity in animals. No human overdose cases are reported, and allergic reactions are limited to hypersensitivity [Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umifenovir , DrugBank: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13609 ]. Danger Threshold: Given the high LD50 in animals and lack of reported human overdoses, it seems likely that Umifenovir becomes dangerous only at doses significantly exceeding therapeutic levels, though exact thresholds are not established due to limited human data. Safety and Clinical Considerations Umifenovir is generally well-tolerated, with a favorable safety profile noted in clinical studies. Side effects are minimal, with sensitization reported in children and rare allergic reactions in hypersensitive individuals. The drug's metabolism by CYP3A4 suggests potential interactions with other medications metabolized by this pathway, though no significant interactions were noted in combined therapy studies [ScienceDirect: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/umifenovir ]. The evidence leans toward Umifenovir having a wide therapeutic index, supported by animal studies showing no pathological changes at high doses and its long-term use in Russia and China without significant safety concerns. However, for precise maximum safe doses and danger thresholds, further human studies are needed, especially given its controversial efficacy in conditions like COVID-19, where higher doses have been suggested but not conclusively proven effective [PMC: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361300/ ]."

    "title": "Uridine",
    "url": "wiki/alone-uridine.html",
    "content": "Uridine Pharmacological Actions The pharmacological actions of uridine triacetate are condition-specific, reflecting its role as a uridine replacement and antidote: Hereditary Orotic Aciduria: This rare metabolic disorder results from mutations in the uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) gene, leading to uridine deficiency. Uridine triacetate compensates by supplying uridine, enabling the synthesis of uridine nucleotides essential for DNA and RNA production. This action reduces the overproduction of orotic acid, mitigating symptoms such as anemia and developmental delays. The mechanism involves replacing the deficient uridine, thus restoring normal pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis and reducing urinary orotic acid excretion. Fluorouracil or Capecitabine Overdose/Toxicity: In cases of overdose or early-onset severe toxicity (within 96 hours post-administration), uridine triacetate acts as a biochemical antagonist. It competes with 5-FU metabolites, such as 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), for incorporation into the RNA and DNA of non-cancerous cells. This competition mitigates cell damage and death, reducing toxicities like neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome, and allows for higher 5-FU doses with improved efficacy and fewer side effects. The time course for these actions is not explicitly detailed for each effect, but pharmacokinetic data suggest onset within 2–3 hours post-dose, aligning with peak plasma uridine concentrations. The duration of effect is influenced by the drug's half-life, discussed below, and its ability to sustain uridine levels sufficient for therapeutic action. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of uridine triacetate is critical for understanding its clinical utility: Absorption and Bioavailability: Uridine triacetate is orally active, delivering 4- to 6-fold more uridine into systemic circulation compared to equimolar doses of uridine itself, as noted in DrugBank: Uridine triacetate. This enhanced bioavailability is due to its prodrug nature, which undergoes rapid deacetylation by nonspecific esterases in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Peak plasma uridine concentrations are generally achieved within 2–3 hours post-oral administration, with no significant difference in rate and extent of exposure under fed versus fasted conditions, as observed in healthy adults receiving a 6-gram dose. Distribution: Uridine, once released, is taken up by cells via nucleoside transporters and crosses the blood-brain barrier, ensuring systemic and central nervous system availability. This distribution is crucial for addressing toxicities affecting the cardiac and central nervous systems. Metabolism and Excretion: It is metabolized by normal pyrimidine catabolic pathways present in most tissues and excreted via the kidneys. This process aligns with its short half-life, ensuring rapid clearance. Half-life: The half-life is approximately 2–2.5 hours, with an extension to 8.2 ± 6.8 hours at higher doses (120 mg/kg) for hereditary orotic aciduria, as detailed in the Xuriden prescribing information. This variability suggests dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, particularly at higher therapeutic levels. Specific pharmacokinetic parameters from clinical studies include: Parameter Day 0 (Uridine, 150-200 mg/kg) Day 1 (XURIDEN, 60 mg/kg) Day 28 (XURIDEN, 60 mg/kg) Day 160 (XURIDEN, 120 mg/kg) Cmax (μM, mean ± SD) 56.0 ± 16.6 91.3 ± 32.2 88.7 ± 43.2 80.9 ± 20.0 Tmax (hours, median, range) 2.0 (1.0, 4.0) 2.0 (1.2, 2.1) 1.3 (1.0, 2.5) 3.0 (2.0, 4.0) t_1/2 (hours, mean ± SD) 1.6 ± 0.7 1.6 ± 0.6 2.3 ± 1.6 8.2 ± 6.8 AUC(0-8) (μM·hr, mean ± SD) 238.0 ± 163.2 311.2 ± 153.3 278.7 ± 148.5 465.6 ± 95.3 These parameters indicate rapid absorption and variable half-life, influencing the timing of therapeutic effects. Drug Interactions: In vitro studies show it is a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), with potential interactions with orally administered P-gp substrates like digoxin (IC50 344 μM). It does not significantly inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes, suggesting minimal risk of clinically important interactions with other drugs. Special Populations: Pharmacokinetic analyses indicate no significant effect of sex, age (range 20–83 years), or body surface area on uridine pharmacokinetics, ensuring consistent dosing across diverse patient groups. Dosage Regimens Dosage varies by indication, with specific guidelines for administration: Hereditary Orotic Aciduria (Xuriden): Starting Dose: 60 mg/kg once daily, administered orally. Increased Dose: May be escalated to 120 mg/kg once daily, not exceeding 8 grams daily, for insufficient efficacy, such as elevated urinary orotic acid, worsening laboratory values (e.g., red blood cell or white blood cell indices), or worsening symptoms. Administration: Measure using a scale accurate to at least 0.1 gram or a graduated teaspoon. Mix with 3–4 ounces of soft food (applesauce, pudding, yogurt) or 5 mL milk/infant formula for doses up to 2 grams, and consume immediately, followed by at least 4 ounces of water. Do not chew granules. Fluorouracil or Capecitabine Overdose/Toxicity (Vistogard): Adults: 10 grams (1 packet) orally every 6 hours for 20 doses, totaling 5 days, without regard to meals. Pediatric: 6.2 grams/m² of body surface area every 6 hours for 20 doses, not exceeding 10 grams per dose. Administration: Mix each dose with 3–4 ounces of soft food, ingest within 30 minutes, and follow with at least 4 ounces of water. If vomiting occurs within 2 hours, administer another complete dose as soon as possible. Can be administered via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube if necessary, using a food starch-based thickening product. Safe Range and Minimum Effective Dose: The minimum effective dose is 60 mg/kg daily for hereditary orotic aciduria, with escalation to 120 mg/kg if needed. For overdose, the regimen of 10 grams every 6 hours is standard, with no lower effective dose specified, as it’s an emergency treatment. The safe range aligns with prescribed doses, with maximums of 8 grams daily for orotic aciduria and 10 grams per dose for overdose, suggesting these are the upper limits without high risks based on clinical data. Maximum Dose Without High Risks: For orotic aciduria, 120 mg/kg (max 8 grams daily); for overdose, 10 grams every 6 hours for 20 doses, as these are the approved maximums with minimal adverse effects reported. LD50 and Toxicity: Specific LD50 values for uridine triacetate are not publicly available, likely due to its high safety profile within therapeutic ranges. Clinical studies and prescribing information indicate no significant toxicity at prescribed doses, with animal studies showing no teratogenicity at half the maximum human dose. Side effects like nausea and vomiting are rare and mild, suggesting a wide therapeutic index. Estimation of When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Given the lack of reported toxicity at prescribed doses and the absence of LD50 data, it’s challenging to estimate. However, exceeding the maximum recommended doses (e.g., >120 mg/kg daily for orotic aciduria or >10 grams per dose for overdose) may increase risks, potentially leading to gastrointestinal distress or other unstudied effects, though no specific threshold is documented. Safety and Adverse Effects Uridine triacetate is generally well-tolerated, with safety profiles varying by indication: Hereditary Orotic Aciduria: No adverse reactions reported in clinical use, as noted in Xuriden Prescribing Information . Fluorouracil/Capecitabine Toxicity: Common adverse reactions include vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea, with serious events like Grade 3 nausea and vomiting reported in <2% of patients, as per DailyMed - VISTOGARD . No contraindications exist, and hypersensitivity reactions are rare, managed by discontinuation and supportive care. Animal studies (rats) at half the maximum human dose showed no teratogenicity or embryofetal effects, with limited human pregnancy data suggesting caution."

    "title": "Valaciclovir",
    "url": "wiki/alone-valaciclovir.html",
    "content": "Valaciclovir Pharmacological Actions Valaciclovir is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to acyclovir and L-valine via first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Acyclovir, the active moiety, undergoes intracellular phosphorylation to form acyclovir triphosphate, which exhibits several key pharmacological actions: Competitive Inhibition of Viral DNA Polymerase: Acyclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for binding to viral DNA polymerase, inhibiting its activity. Incorporation and Termination of Viral DNA Chain: It incorporates into the growing viral DNA chain, leading to chain termination due to the lack of a 3'-hydroxyl group, halting viral replication. Inactivation of Viral DNA Polymerase: The drug inactivates the polymerase, further preventing viral DNA synthesis. Antiviral Spectrum: These actions are effective against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), with higher efficacy against HSV due to efficient phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. The targets include thymidine kinase (Q9QNF7, HHV-1) and DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (P04293, HHV-1), as noted in pharmacological databases. Timing of Pharmacological Actions The time to influence, or onset of action, is complex due to the distinction between pharmacokinetic and clinical effects. Pharmacokinetically, valaciclovir is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations of acyclovir, the active form, reached in approximately 2-3 hours post-dose, as supported by clinical pharmacokinetics studies [Ref: Synapse.patsnap.com, 2024]. This suggests that the drug begins to exert its antiviral effects at the cellular level within hours, inhibiting viral DNA replication. Clinically, the time to noticeable effects varies by condition. For cold sores, clinical trials indicate that when taken within two hours of symptom onset (e.g., tingling, itching), valaciclovir can reduce the duration by about one day compared to placebo, with effects becoming apparent over several days [Ref: Hims.com, 2023]. For herpes zoster, studies show accelerated resolution of zoster-associated pain, with durations reduced from 51 to 38 days compared to acyclovir, indicating a longer-term clinical effect [Ref: ScienceDirect, 1995]. Thus, while the pharmacological action starts within hours, clinical benefits may take days to manifest, depending on the timing of administration and the condition treated. Half-Life The plasma elimination half-life of acyclovir, following valaciclovir administration, is 2.5 to 3.3 hours in volunteers with normal renal function, as per FDA labeling [Ref: FDA Label, 2008]. This half-life can extend significantly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), reaching approximately 14 hours, and is reduced to about 4 hours during hemodialysis, with about one-third of acyclovir removed during a 4-hour session. Bioavailabilities Valaciclovir is administered orally, with the absolute bioavailability of acyclovir after a 1 gram oral dose being 54.5% ± 9.1%, as determined in 12 healthy volunteers [Ref: FDA Label, 2008]. This bioavailability is not significantly altered by food, with studies showing similar levels 30 minutes after a high-fat breakfast. No other routes of administration are commonly used for valaciclovir, as it is designed for oral delivery to improve acyclovir bioavailability compared to direct acyclovir administration. Dosages Dosages are condition-specific and adjusted for renal function, as detailed in the FDA prescribing information: Cold Sores: 2 grams every 12 hours for 1 day, initiated at the earliest symptom (e.g., tingling, burning, itching). Initial Genital Herpes: 1 gram twice daily for 10 days. Recurrent Genital Herpes: 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Suppressive Therapy for Genital Herpes: 1 gram once daily for immunocompetent patients, or 500 mg once daily for those with ≤9 recurrences per year; for HIV-infected patients, 500 mg twice daily. Herpes Zoster: 1 gram three times daily for 7 days, initiated within 48 hours of rash onset. Chickenpox (Pediatric, 2 to <18 years): 20 mg/kg three times daily for 5 days, not to exceed 1 gram three times daily, initiated within 24 hours of rash onset. For patients with renal impairment, dosages are adjusted based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), as shown in the following table: Indications Normal Dose (CrCl ≥50 mL/min) CrCl 30-49 mL/min CrCl 10-29 mL/min CrCl <10 mL/min Cold Sores 2 g every 12 hr, 1 day 1 g every 12 hr, 1 day 500 mg every 12 hr, 1 day 500 mg single dose Genital Herpes: Initial 1 g every 12 hr No reduction 1 g every 24 hr 500 mg every 24 hr Genital Herpes: Recurrent 500 mg every 12 hr, 3 days No reduction 500 mg every 24 hr 500 mg every 24 hr Genital Herpes: Suppressive 1 g/500 mg once daily/500 mg twice daily 500 mg every 24 hr/500 mg every 48 hr/500 mg every 24 hr 500 mg every 24 hr/500 mg every 48 hr/500 mg every 24 hr 500 mg every 24 hr/500 mg every 48 hr/500 mg every 24 hr Herpes Zoster 1 g every 8 hr, 7 days 1 g every 12 hr 1 g every 24 hr 500 mg every 24 hr Hemodialysis patients should receive the dose post-session, with acyclovir half-life during dialysis approximately 4 hours, and no supplemental doses are needed post-peritoneal dialysis. Safe Range, Minimum Effective Dose, and Maximum Safe Dose The safe range is defined by the prescribed dosages for each indication, with adjustments for renal function ensuring safety. The minimum effective dose is 500 mg once daily for suppressive therapy in patients with fewer recurrences. The maximum prescribed dose is 1 gram three times daily for herpes zoster, totaling 3 grams per day, considered safe for adults with normal renal function. However, exceeding these doses, especially in patients with renal impairment, increases risks. LD50 and Toxicity Thresholds The oral LD50 for valaciclovir in rats is 903.5 mg/kg, as reported in pharmacological databases [Ref: DrugBank, 2021]. For humans, there is no direct LD50 value, but case reports indicate that overdoses of up to 20 grams have been associated with neurotoxicity, particularly in patients with renal failure or those receiving excessive doses relative to their renal function [Ref: PMC, 2014]. Symptoms include confusion, hallucinations, and acute renal failure, with risks heightened in the elderly or those with underlying kidney disease. The point at which valaciclovir starts to become too dangerous is when doses significantly exceed prescribed levels, especially in the context of renal impairment. For example, doses leading to plasma acyclovir levels causing precipitation in renal tubules (solubility 2.5 mg/mL) can induce acute renal failure, and neurotoxicity can manifest at high doses, as seen in overdoses of 20 grams."

    "content": "Vitamin D Supplementation with vitamin D is a reliable method for preventing or treating rickets. Vitamin D supplements do not alter the outcomes for myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, bone fractures or knee osteoarthritis. Vitamin D supplementation at low doses may slightly decrease the overall risk of acute respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to the severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Supplementation leads to improvements in scores for clinical inflammatory bowel disease activity and biochemical markers, and less frequent relapse of symptoms in IBD. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency have been associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Vitamin D supplementation substantially reduced the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A meta-analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes for non-obese people with prediabetes. Another meta-analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation significantly improved glycemic control [homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In prospective studies, high versus low levels of vitamin D were respectively associated with a significant decrease in risk of type 2 diabetes, combined type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, and prediabetes. A systematic review included one clinical trial that showed vitamin D supplementation together with insulin maintained levels of fasting C-peptide after 12 months better than insulin alone. A meta-analysis of observational studies showed that children with ADHD have lower vitamin D levels and that there was a small association between low vitamin D levels at the time of birth and later development of ADHD. Several small, randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation indicated improved ADHD symptoms such as impulsivity and hyperactivity. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for depressive symptoms have generally been of low quality and show no overall effect, although subgroup analysis showed supplementation for participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms or depressive disorder had a moderate effect. A systematic review of clinical studies found an association between low vitamin D levels with cognitive impairment and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to have lower serum vitamin D concentrations compared to those without the condition. Erectile dysfunction can be a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. In women, vitamin D receptors are expressed in the superficial layers of the urogenital organs. Pregnant women often do not take the recommended amount of vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D in pregnancy are associated with gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and small for gestational age infants. Obesity increases the risk of having low serum vitamin D. Supplementation does not lead to weight loss, but weight loss increases serum vitamin D. The theory is that fatty tissue sequesters vitamin D. Bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Long-term follow-up reported deficiencies for vitamins D, E, A, K and B12, with D the most common at 36%. There is evidence that the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids is associated with low serum vitamin D and that supplementation reduces the size of fibroids. The US Adequate Intake recommendations from 1997 were 200 IU/day for infants, children, adults to age 50, and women during pregnancy or lactation, 400 IU/day for ages 51–70, and 600 IU/day for 71 and older. Conversion: 1 μg (microgram) = 40 IU (international unit)."

    "title": "Voriconazole",
    "url": "wiki/alone-voriconazole.html",
    "content": "Voriconazole Pharmacological Actions Voriconazole's primary pharmacological action is the inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase, a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of 14α-methylated sterols and a decrease in ergosterol, altering cell membrane permeability and ultimately inhibiting fungal growth. Research indicates it is active against pathogens such as Aspergillus, Candida, Fusarium, Scedosporium, Exserohilum rostratum, Cryptococcus neoformans, and C. gattii, with variable activity against Fusarium and Scedosporium apiospermum. The effectiveness over time is concentration-dependent, with optimal therapeutic plasma concentrations typically maintained between 2 and 5 mcg/mL. Higher concentrations may lead to adverse effects, as discussed later. Half-life The elimination half-life of Voriconazole is approximately 6 hours for a 200 mg oral dose, based on studies in healthy adults. However, due to its non-linear pharmacokinetics, the half-life is dose-dependent, varying from 6 to 9 hours at steady state following multiple oral doses of 200 mg every 12 hours. This non-linearity is likely due to saturable hepatic metabolism, primarily via cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which can lead to dose-dependent accumulation. Bioavailabilities Oral Bioavailability: Approximately 96%, allowing for effective switching between IV and oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 1–2 hours, though food can reduce mean peak plasma concentrations by 34% and the extent of absorption by 24%, suggesting it should be taken on an empty stomach. Intravenous (IV) Bioavailability: 100%, as it is directly administered into the bloodstream, ensuring complete bioavailability. Dosages Dosages vary by condition, patient weight, and administration route. Below is a detailed breakdown for adults with invasive aspergillosis, a common indication: Route Weight (kg) Loading Dose Maintenance Dose Maximum Dose Notes Oral ≥40 Not specified 200 mg every 12 hours 300 mg every 12 hours Increase if response inadequate, reduce by 50 mg steps if not tolerated. Oral <40 Not specified 100 mg every 12 hours 150 mg every 12 hours Adjust based on response and tolerance. IV All 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 doses 4 mg/kg every 12 hours 4 mg/kg every 12 hours Reduce to 3 mg/kg if not tolerated; monitor for toxicity. For other conditions such as candidemia or fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium, dosages may differ, and specific guidelines should be consulted. Pediatric dosages also vary, typically based on body weight, with maximum oral doses up to 350 mg every 12 hours for certain age groups. Safe Range, Minimum Effective Dose, and Maximum Dose Safe Range: Research suggests maintaining serum trough concentrations between 2 and 5 mcg/mL is safe and effective. Concentrations above 5 mcg/mL are associated with increased risk of adverse effects, including neurotoxicity, visual disturbances, and liver toxicity. Minimum Effective Dose: While not explicitly defined, standard maintenance doses start at 100 mg every 12 hours orally for adults weighing less than 40 kg, indicating a likely minimum effective dose for many patients. Maximum Dose: For adults ≥40 kg, the maximum oral dose is 300 mg every 12 hours, and IV maintenance is up to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours, with reductions recommended if toxicity is observed. LD50 and Toxicity LD50: In animal studies, specifically rats, the oral LD50 is reported to be between 800 and 1600 mg/kg body weight. Human LD50 data is not available, as such values are typically derived from animal models and not directly applicable to humans due to ethical and practical constraints. Toxicity and Dangerous Dosage: Serum concentrations exceeding 5 mcg/mL are considered potentially dangerous, with risks including visual disturbances (e.g., photophobia, blurred vision), liver toxicity (elevated transaminases, jaundice), and severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Overdose symptoms may include prolonged QTc interval and other systemic toxicities, requiring immediate medical intervention. Monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial, especially in patients with hepatic impairment, where metabolism may be altered. Additional Considerations Food Interaction: Food reduces oral absorption, decreasing peak plasma concentrations by 34% and extent by 24%, so it is recommended to take Voriconazole on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or after meals. Special Populations: Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver dysfunction (e.g., reduce maintenance dose by half for mild to moderate impairment), and caution is advised in renal impairment for IV administration due to potential accumulation of the vehicle (sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium). Safety and efficacy are not established for children under 2 years. Drug Interactions: Voriconazole is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450, leading to significant interactions with drugs like rifampin, carbamazepine, and certain protease inhibitors, which may necessitate dose adjustments or contraindications."

    "content": "Inosine + DMAE List of ME/CFS Recovery and Improvement Stories Homemade Isoprinosine/Immunovir Warning about inosine plus dmae Inosine and DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) are compounds used in various health contexts, with Inosine often part of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments like Imunovir (Inosine Pranobex), and DMAE marketed for cognitive and skin health. The combination, termed \"homemade Imunovir,\" is not a pharmaceutical product but is discussed in forums as a potential substitute, particularly for conditions like ME/CFS. This note synthesizes available data to provide detailed insights into their pharmacological actions, time courses, pharmacokinetics, and dosage considerations. Pharmacological Actions Inosine: Inosine is a nucleoside involved in purine metabolism, with significant immunomodulatory effects. It enhances T-cell lymphocyte proliferation, boosts natural killer cell activity, and increases pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring deficient immune responses in immunosuppressed patients [PMC6822865]. It is also used in antiviral contexts, such as in Imunovir for herpes simplex and other viral infections, likely by affecting viral RNA levels and supporting immune function. Emerging research suggests neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective roles, with potential benefits in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis [DrugBank DB04335]. DMAE: DMAE is structurally similar to choline and is believed to support acetylcholine production, a neurotransmitter crucial for memory and focus, though it's not a direct precursor [Nootropics Expert]. It is used in supplements for cognitive enhancement, with studies exploring benefits for ADHD, depression, and Alzheimer's, though evidence is limited and older [Healthline]. In cosmetics, 3% DMAE gel has shown efficacy in reducing wrinkles and improving skin appearance over 16 weeks, suggesting anti-aging properties [PubMed 15675889]. Combination (Inosine + DMAE): Specific studies on the combination are scarce, but forum discussions (e.g., Phoenix Rising) suggest users aim to mimic Imunovir's effects, which includes Inosine combined with dimepranol acedoben, not DMAE. User reports indicate varied experiences: some found benefits similar to Imunovir, while others reported overstimulation, dizziness, and confusion, suggesting DMAE might add cognitive or stimulatory effects not present in Imunovir [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. Given Inosine's immune focus and DMAE's cognitive potential, the combination might theoretically offer both immunomodulation and brain support, but this is speculative without clinical data. Time Courses of Pharmacological Actions Inosine: Immunomodulatory effects, such as increased T-cell activity, may take days to weeks to manifest, as immune responses often require sustained exposure. Antiviral effects, when part of combinations like Imunovir, are typically seen over treatment courses of 7-14 days for herpes infections [Medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2824]. DMAE: Cognitive effects, if present, might be noticed more quickly, potentially within hours to days, given its role in neurotransmitter support, though evidence is limited. Skin benefits from topical DMAE were observed over 16 weeks in clinical studies [PubMed 15675889]. Combination: Without specific studies, time courses are inferred from individual components. Immune effects might lag, while cognitive effects could be quicker, but user reports suggest immediate overstimulation risks, indicating rapid onset for some effects [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. Pharmacokinetics Half-Life: Inosine: Estimated at approximately 15 hours, based on its metabolism as a stable purine nucleoside, with a longer half-life compared to adenosine (about 10 seconds) [PubMed 26903141]. DMAE: Specific half-life data is not widely available, but studies suggest a half-life of around 24 hours in fetal rat brain cell cultures, and excretion data (57–64% in urine within 24 hours in rats) implies a half-life of several hours, likely 12-24 hours [PMC7252906]. Bioavailability: Inosine: Orally bioavailable, with up to 70% recovered as urinary uric acid in animal studies, indicating significant absorption [Medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2824]. Clinical trials for Parkinson's used oral doses effectively, suggesting good bioavailability [JAMA 2784144]. DMAE: Well-absorbed orally, with animal studies showing 21–44% tissue retention at 24 hours and significant urinary excretion, indicating good oral bioavailability [PMC7252906]. Different Bioavailabilities (Including Oral Route): Both compounds are primarily considered for oral administration, with no specific data on other routes for the combination. Inosine's oral bioavailability is supported by its use in oral formulations, while DMAE's is confirmed by animal studies showing absorption and distribution. Dosage Information The following table summarizes dosage details for Inosine and DMAE, based on available literature and user reports: Aspect Inosine DMAE Typical Dose 500 mg to 2 g per day (supplements, clinical trials) 100-500 mg per day (supplements) Safe Range Up to 2 g/day, monitor uric acid levels Up to 500 mg/day, higher doses risk side effects Minimum Effective Dose Not specified, start at 500 mg/day Not specified, start at 100 mg/day Maximum Safe Dose Limited by uric acid elevation, typically 2 g/day Limited by side effects, typically 500 mg/day LD50 Not specified, likely high based on safety profile 1803 mg/kg oral in rats When It Starts to Become Dangerous High uric acid levels (gout, kidney stones) Overstimulation, insomnia, at higher doses Combination Considerations: Start with low doses (e.g., 500 mg Inosine and 100 mg DMAE daily) and monitor for side effects, especially overstimulation or sleep issues, as reported in forums [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. Adjust based on individual tolerance, and consult a healthcare professional, particularly for ME/CFS patients where stimulants may be harmful. Safety and Side Effects Inosine: Main concerns include elevated uric acid levels, potentially leading to gout or kidney stones, as seen in MS trials where 4/16 patients developed kidney stones [Wikipedia Inosine]. Clinical trials for Parkinson's used doses up to 2 g/day, generally well-tolerated with monitoring [JAMA 2784144]. DMAE: Reported side effects include insomnia, muscle tension, headaches, and overstimulation, especially at higher doses. Forum users noted dizziness and confusion with the combination, suggesting caution [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]. The LD50 in rats (1803 mg/kg oral) indicates high toxicity thresholds, but therapeutic doses are much lower. Combination: User reports highlight risks of overstimulation, with some finding it intolerable, particularly in ME/CFS contexts. Dr. Ros Vallings noted 33% of ME/CFS patients benefit from Imunovir, but 10% cannot tolerate it, suggesting similar risks for the homemade version [Phoenix Rising Forum 81113]."

Below is a comprehensive list of its main pharmacological actions, along with how each influences the body or relevant systems. These are derived from preclinical, clinical, and mechanistic studies, as AICAR is not approved for routine human therapeutic use and remains experimental. 1. AMPK Activation - Influence: Mimics cellular energy depletion by increasing intracellular ZMP (AICAR monophosphate), which binds to AMPK's γ-subunit, leading to allosteric activation, Thr172 phosphorylation by LKB1, and protection against dephosphorylation. This promotes catabolic processes (e.g., glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation) and inhibits anabolic ones (e.g., protein/lipid synthesis). Results in improved metabolic efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and enhanced adaptation to stress like exercise or ischemia. In skeletal muscle, it mimics endurance training by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity via PGC-1α upregulation. In adipose tissue, it reduces fat accumulation. AMPK-independent effects include direct inhibition of nucleotide synthesis enzymes. 2. Metabolic Regulation (Glucose and Lipid Metabolism) - Influence: Enhances insulin-independent glucose uptake in muscle and liver via GLUT4 translocation, lowers blood glucose, and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Increases fatty acid oxidation and inhibits lipolysis, reducing plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol. In obese models, it normalizes dyslipidemia and improves insulin sensitivity, potentially aiding type 2 diabetes management. Influences energy homeostasis in embryonic stem cells and podocytes, ameliorating high-fructose-induced disturbances. 3. Cardioprotection Against Ischemia - Influence: Inhibits adenosine kinase and deaminase in cardiac cells, increasing adenosine levels during ischemia, which enhances nucleotide re-synthesis and preserves blood flow. Reduces myocardial infarction risk, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Used clinically in the 1980s-1990s for cardiac surgery protection; reduces early cardiac death and adverse outcomes in bypass patients. 4. Anti-Cancer and Apoptotic Effects - Influence: Induces apoptosis in cancer cells (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma) via upregulation of BH3-only proteins (BIM, NOXA) or p53-independent pathways, inhibiting mTORC1 and autophagy in some contexts. Suppresses tumor growth in xenografts by elevating ZMP, disrupting purine biosynthesis, and reducing proliferation. Effects can be AMPK-independent, involving nucleotide imbalance. In hematological malignancies, it shows antileukemic activity at tolerable plasma levels (0.9 mM). 5. Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Cachectic Effects - Influence: Suppresses inflammation-induced muscle wasting (e.g., in cancer cachexia) by inhibiting IFNγ/TNFα pathways, independent of mitochondrial effects. Reduces adipose tissue inflammation, improving glucose tolerance. In osteoarthritis, enhances chondrocyte autophagy and regulates cholesterol metabolism. 6. Neuroprotective and Anti-Neurodegenerative Effects - Influence: Activates autophagy via mTORC1 inhibition, potentially protecting against neurodegenerative diseases. In diabetic polyneuropathy models, regulates mitophagy, preventing/reversing nerve damage. Poor blood-brain barrier penetration limits direct CNS effects. 7. Exercise-Mimetic and Performance-Enhancing Effects - Influence: Increases muscle endurance by switching to oxidative fibers, enhancing mitochondrial function, and upregulating enzymes like succinate dehydrogenase. Mimics exercise benefits without physical activity, but banned in sports as a metabolic modulator. 8. Nucleotide Synthesis Modulation - Influence: Inhibits purine and pyrimidine synthesis as a substrate in de novo pathways, leading to accumulation of intermediates like SAICAR. Affects DNA/RNA synthesis, contributing to anti-proliferative effects in cancer. 9. Hypoxia and Stress Response - Influence: Enhances adaptation to low oxygen via AMPK, stabilizing HIF-1α and promoting angiogenesis or metabolic shifts. Some effects are AMPK-independent. 10. Other Effects: Regulates pluripotency in stem cells via PI3K/GSK3β/β-catenin; ameliorates insulin resistance in obesity; protects against radiation in some models. Pharmacokinetics - Half-Life: Approximately 1-5 hours in human plasma (e.g., 1.4 hours post-IV infusion; estimates vary by study). Cellular ZMP (active metabolite) persists longer, sustaining effects. - Bioavailability: Oral <5% (poor absorption); IV administration preferred for full systemic exposure. Subcutaneous or intraperitoneal used in research, but not clinically standardized. - Absorption/Distribution: Rapidly absorbed IV; distributes to tissues like muscle, heart, and liver. Poor blood-brain barrier penetration. - Metabolism/Elimination: Converted to ZMP by adenosine kinase; cleared renally; may elevate uric/lactic acid at high doses. Dosages AICAR is experimental and not FDA-approved for human use. Dosages are from clinical trials (primarily IV for cardiac protection or leukemia) and animal studies. No established \"safe range\" for routine use, but tolerability data exist. - Clinical Trials (Humans, IV): - Single doses: 50-315 mg/kg (maximum tolerated dose [MTD] 210 mg/kg; optimal biological dose [OBD] 210 mg/kg). - Multiple doses: 210 mg/kg over 2-5 days. - Phase I/II (e.g., CLL): Up to 210 mg/kg, achieving plasma levels of 0.9 mM. - Cardiac surgery: 0.6-10 g total (e.g., 100-210 mg/kg perioperatively). - Minimum Effective: ~10-50 mg/kg for metabolic effects in early trials. - Maximum Without High Risks: 210 mg/kg (adverse effects increase above this; e.g., hyperuricemia, hypotension). - Animal/Preclinical Studies: - Metabolic/diabetes models: 250-500 mg/kg/day (IP/SC) for 4-13 weeks. - Exercise-mimetic: 0.5-1 g/kg/day. - Neuropathy: 500 mg/kg (SC, 3 days/week for months). - Safe Range (Human Data): Up to 210 mg/kg IV single/multiple doses tolerated with mild/transient side effects (e.g., hyperuricemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, renal impairment). Equivalent oral doses (10-100 mg/kg) show poor efficacy due to low bioavailability but similar safety. - Minimum Effective Dose: Varies; ~10-50 mg/kg IV for AMPK activation/metabolic effects. - Maximum Without High Risks: 210 mg/kg IV (MTD); higher risks above this include clinically significant hypotension/renal issues. - When Dangerous: Starts at >210 mg/kg IV (e.g., grade ≥2 toxicities like severe hyperuricemia or hypotension). No human overdose data; animal models show no acute lethality at 500 mg/kg, but chronic high doses cause lactic/uric acid buildup. Toxicity and LD50 - LD50: Not available for humans. Predicted rat oral LD50: ~2.4 mol/kg (low acute toxicity). No experimental LD50 reported; considered low-toxicity based on trials (no deaths at 315 mg/kg IV). - Estimation of Danger: Becomes \"too dangerous\" at >210 mg/kg IV (increased risk of uric acid elevation, hypotension, renal impairment). Chronic use may amplify metabolic disturbances (e.g., lactic acidosis). Not highly toxic acutely, but off-target effects (e.g., nucleotide disruption) limit long-term safety. Banned in sports; avoid non-research use."

    "title": "Alimemazine",
    "url": "actions.html?md=alimemazine",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Alimemazine Alimemazine (also known as trimeprazine) is a phenothiazine derivative primarily used as a first-generation antihistamine. It exhibits multiple pharmacological actions due to its structure, which is similar to phenothiazine antipsychotics but with distinct ring substitutions and chain characteristics. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions based on available data. For each action, I've included quantitative or descriptive values where possible (e.g., potency comparisons, onset/duration influenced by pharmacokinetics, or clinical effects). These actions are interconnected, as alimemazine's effects stem from antagonism at various receptors (e.g., H1 histamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, dopamine, and alpha-adrenergic). The influence of each action is modulated by pharmacokinetic parameters like time to peak plasma concentration (1-2 hours in children; ~4.5 hours in adults for tablets), which affects onset, and half-life (4.8-6.8 hours), which influences duration (typically 4-12 hours per dose, with accumulation possible on repeated dosing). I've provided as many quantitative values as available from reliable sources (e.g., clinical studies, drug monographs). 1. Antihistaminic (H1 Receptor Antagonism): - Description/Influence: Primary action; competes with histamine for H1-receptor binding, reducing histamine-mediated symptoms like vasodilation, capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. This leads to relief from allergic reactions, including pruritus (itching), urticaria (hives), and other skin allergies. It does not significantly affect H2 receptors. - Values: High potency as an H1 antagonist (comparable to other phenothiazines like promethazine). Onset: ~1-2 hours post-oral dose (based on time to peak). Duration: 4-8 hours, influenced by half-life (4.8-6.8 hours). Effective in reducing pruritus episodes (e.g., one study in children showed mean retching episodes reduced from 47.67/week on placebo to 10.42/week on alimemazine, p<0.0001). Predicted blood-brain barrier permeability: 98.86% (contributes to central effects). - Clinical Notes: Used for eczema, poison ivy, insect bites, and hay fever. Paradoxical effects (e.g., restlessness) possible in some cases. 2. Sedative/Hypnotic: - Description/Influence: Central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect, promoting drowsiness and sleep by blocking H1 receptors in the brain and enhancing GABAergic activity. Influences calmness, reduces anxiety, and aids in insomnia or premedication before surgery/procedures. Comparable to chlorpromazine but without strong anti-adrenergic effects. - Values: Sedative potency equivalent to chlorpromazine (e.g., central sedative effect score similar in pharmacodynamic studies). Onset: 1-2 hours (correlates with time to peak; rough correlation with blood concentrations in children for pre-anesthetic sedation). Duration: 6-12 hours, extended by half-life (median 6.8 hours in children; risk of morning sleepiness as a side effect in 7.8% of patients). In GAD studies, 20-40 mg prolonged-release form reduced anxiety scores by ~14 points on HARS scale over 6 weeks (p<0.0001), with ≥50% reduction in 69.4% of patients. - Clinical Notes: Used for insomnia, cough suppression, and pediatric day surgery premedication. Additive with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids). 3. Antiemetic (Anti-Nausea/Anti-Vomiting): - Description/Influence: Blocks H1 receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius (vomiting center) and has anticholinergic effects that reduce vestibular and gastrointestinal signals. Prevents motion sickness and nausea from allergies or other causes. - Values: Effective dose reduces emetic episodes (e.g., in pediatric study, reduced retching by ~78%). Onset: ~1-2 hours. Duration: 4-8 hours, aligned with half-life. No specific potency metrics, but antiemetic action is secondary to H1 and anticholinergic blockade. - Clinical Notes: Principally used as an antiemetic in combination with cough/cold preparations. 4. Antimuscarinic (Anticholinergic): - Description/Influence: Significant blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (central and peripheral), leading to reduced secretions (e.g., bronchial, salivary), urinary retention, dry mouth, and blurred vision. Influences antiemetic and sedative effects but can cause side effects like constipation or tachycardia. - Values: High antimuscarinic activity (e.g., side effects like dry mouth in 7.8% of patients). Onset: Rapid (1-2 hours). Duration: Matches half-life (4.8-6.8 hours). Protein binding: >90%, which may prolong effects. - Clinical Notes: Caution in elderly (risk of urinary retention, constipation) or glaucoma patients. 5. Antidopaminergic (Neuroleptic): - Description/Influence: Blocks dopamine D2 receptors at usual doses, contributing to sedative and antiemetic effects but potentially causing extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., parkinsonism, dystonia). Influences calmness and reduces hyperactivity. - Values: Neuroleptic potency at standard doses (e.g., Simpson-Angus Scale score of 6 indicating clinically significant extrapyramidal effects in long-term use). Onset: 1-2 hours. Duration: 4-12 hours. In one case, 10 mg daily for 20 years caused drug-induced parkinsonism. - Clinical Notes: Not used as a primary antipsychotic; related to chlorpromazine structure. 6. Adrenolytic (Alpha-Adrenergic Antagonism): - Description/Influence: Weak blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to risk of orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure drop on standing). Influences vasodilation and may enhance sedative effects. - Values: Risk of orthostatic hypotension noted, but largely devoid of strong anti-adrenaline action compared to chlorpromazine. No specific quantitative potency; side effect incidence low (~4-7% for weakness/dizziness). - Clinical Notes: Caution in patients with cardiovascular issues. Pharmacokinetic Parameters Influencing Actions These parameters affect how quickly and how long each action manifests. Alimemazine is rapidly absorbed but has variable inter-individual differences (e.g., substantial in children). - Half-Life: 4.78 ± 0.59 hours (adults); median 6.8 hours (range 4.4-18.5 hours) in children. Influences duration of all actions (e.g., longer half-life extends sedation but risks accumulation). - Bioavailabilities: - Oral (tablet): <70% (food delays absorption; time to peak 4.5 ± 0.43 hours). - Oral (syrup): ~70% (time to peak ~3.5 hours; faster than tablets). - General absorption: Well absorbed in digestive tract; predicted human intestinal absorption 97.38% (computational), but actual <70% due to first-pass metabolism. - No data on IV or other routes (not available). - Time to Peak Plasma Concentration: 1-2 hours (children, oral dose); 4.5 ± 0.43 hours (adults, tablet). Influences onset of actions (e.g., sedation correlates with peak levels). - Maximum Concentration (Cmax): Median 0.357 μmol/L (children, 3 mg/kg dose). - Area Under Curve (AUC): Median 2.758 μmol·L⁻¹·hr (children; range 1.429-5.459). - Clearance: Median 3.7 L/kg/hr (children, assuming 100% bioavailability). - Metabolism: Hepatic (liver enzymes; reduced in elderly/hepatic impairment). - Excretion: Primarily urine (significant amounts as metabolites; decreases in renal impairment). No cerebrospinal fluid penetration detected. Dosages Dosages vary by indication, age, and formulation (e.g., tartrate salt; 10 mg alimemazine tartrate ≈ 7.5 mg base). Always start at lowest effective dose; do not exceed recommended (risk of overdose, mortality with alcohol/substances). Minimum effective dose is typically the starting dose; safe range is up to max daily for intractable cases. Contraindicated in children <2-3 years (risk of severe sedation/respiratory depression). Reduce in elderly/renal/hepatic impairment. - Urticaria/Pruritus/Allergic Skin Conditions: - Adults: 10 mg 2-3 times daily (minimum effective: 10 mg/day; safe range: up to 100 mg/day for intractable cases). - Elderly: 10 mg 1-2 times daily (minimum effective: 10 mg/day; safe range: up to 20 mg/day). - Children (>2-3 years): 2.5-5 mg 3-4 times daily (minimum effective: 2.5 mg/dose; safe range: up to 20 mg/day). Use syrup for precision. - Children (5-11 years): 5 mg 3-4 times daily (safe range: up to 20 mg/day). - Children (12-17 years): Adult dosing. - Insomnia/Sleep Disorders (Short-Term): - Adults: 10-30 mg 1-2 hours before bedtime (minimum effective: 10 mg; safe range: up to 30 mg/night). - Prolonged-release: 20-40 mg/day (e.g., for GAD; reduces anxiety by 50%+ in 69% of patients over 6 weeks). - Premedication (Sedation Before Anesthesia/Surgery): - Adults/Children >12 years: 2-4 mg/kg (max 50 mg) 1-2 hours pre-procedure (minimum effective: 2 mg/kg; safe range: up to 50 mg). - Children (3-7 years): Max 2 mg/kg 1-2 hours pre-procedure (safe range: up to 2 mg/kg). - Children (2-7 years, with chloral hydrate): 1-2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) 1.5-2 hours pre-procedure. - Other (e.g., Antiemetic, Cough): 10 mg 2-3 times daily (adults); adjust based on response. Overdose toxicity: 20-40 mg in toddlers causes mild intoxication; >300 mg in children or 0.8-2 g in adults causes serious effects (treat with dantrolene if needed). Consult a healthcare provider for personalized dosing."

    "content": "Yes, Andrographis paniculata (commonly known as green chiretta or king of bitters) is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, and it has been extensively studied for its interactions with the immune system. Research indicates that extracts from the plant, particularly its active compound andrographolide, exhibit immunomodulatory effects, meaning they can regulate and enhance immune responses by influencing immune cells, cytokines, and other components of the immune system. For example, it has been shown to stimulate T lymphocytes, activate macrophages, suppress excessive proinflammatory cytokines, and promote overall immune function, which may help in reducing the severity of infections like the common cold or upper respiratory tract issues. Regarding immunodeficiency (a condition involving weakened or impaired immune function), Andrographis paniculata has demonstrated potential benefits in preclinical studies. In animal models where immunosuppression was induced (e.g., using cyclophosphamide), leaf extracts of the plant helped restore immune parameters, such as improving white blood cell counts and enhancing antibody production, suggesting a protective or restorative role against induced immunodeficiency. Additionally, its antiviral properties have been explored in contexts like HIV (which causes acquired immunodeficiency), where it shows immunostimulant and anti-HIV activities by regulating host immunity and inhibiting viral factors. However, while these findings indicate a positive relationship, human clinical evidence is limited, and it may interact with immunosuppressive medications by counteracting their effects (e.g., in transplant patients), potentially leading to complications. Always consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially for immune-related conditions."

    "url": "actions.html?md=berberine",
    "content": "Yes, berberine, a natural alkaloid found in certain plants, has been extensively studied for its interactions with the immune system. It exhibits immunomodulatory effects, such as suppressing pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells while promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th2 cells, which helps balance immune responses in conditions like autoimmune diseases. This modulation can reduce inflammation by inhibiting cytokine production and restoring Th1/Th2 equilibrium, potentially aiding in scenarios like COVID-19 by preventing cytokine storms and enhancing cell-mediated immunity. Berberine also promotes innate immunity through pathways like p38 MAPK, which activates immune cells to fight infections. Additionally, it influences macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, further attenuating inflammatory responses in tissues like the gut. Regarding immunodeficiency, berberine shows relevance in conditions involving compromised immunity, such as HIV infection. It demonstrates antiviral activity against HIV and other viruses like herpes simplex and human cytomegalovirus, potentially inhibiting replication. In people living with HIV under virological suppression, berberine has been found safe and effective in improving metabolic syndrome components without adverse effects on immune status. It may also address immune dysfunction in disorders like immune thrombocytopenia by correcting corticosteroid resistance linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, while berberine can suppress overactive immune responses in autoimmune contexts (e.g., multiple sclerosis or colitis), there is no evidence it directly causes or worsens immunodeficiency; instead, its effects appear context-dependent, often supportive in deficient states."

    "title": "Cellulase",
    "url": "actions.html?md=cellulase",
    "content": "Implications of Cellulase Supplements in Human Diets: Health, Culinary, and Sustainability Perspectives ======================================================================================================= 1\\. Health Effects ------------------ Potential Benefits: Cellulase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes cellulose (the β‐1,4--linked glucose polymer in plant cell walls) into smaller sugars. Humans lack endogenous cellulase, so dietary cellulose ordinarily passes through undigested. Supplemental cellulase could convert insoluble fiber into absorbable sugars, potentially increasing nutrient availability. For example, adding cellulase can \"make for more comfortable digestion\" of tough plant fibers; breaking down cellulose reduces gas and bloating from fiber fermentation. In animal studies, cellulase supplementation has shown \"prebiotic‐like\" effects: rats fed Aspergillus‐derived cellulase had markedly higher levels of probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) in the gut. This suggests cellulase might favorably modulate the human microbiome by freeing up fermentable sugars and amino acids that feed beneficial gut flora. (See image below: cellulose is a glucose polymer; cellulase would cleave the β‐1,4 linkages.) Figure: The cellulose molecule -- a long chain of β‐linked glucose units that humans cannot digest without cellulase. (Source: Dartmouth DUJS.) Potential Risks: Cellulase supplements appear to have a low risk profile, but general digestive enzyme caution applies. Common side effects of enzyme pills include gastrointestinal upset (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, bloating) and, rarely, allergic reactions. Since cellulase is often derived from fungi (e.g. Aspergillus), individuals with mold allergies might react. However, EFSA's safety review of food‐grade cellulase reports no sequence matches to known allergens and concludes \"no safety concerns under the intended conditions of use\". Notably, EFSA did caution that allergic sensitization cannot be fully excluded, but the likelihood is considered low. Any sizeable release of free glucose from cellulose would modestly increase glycemic load, but one source claims properly formulated cellulase supplements \"don't release free sugars\" to cause blood‐glucose spikes. A more general risk is that excessive cellulose breakdown would deplete dietary fiber. Insoluble fiber (cellulose) normally supports bowel regularity, binds toxins, and promotes beneficial fermentation, so removing too much fiber could weaken these health benefits. Careful dosing would be needed to avoid constipation or loss of fiber's positive effects. Clinical Studies: Human trials are sparse. A small randomized trial of a multi‐enzyme supplement (Amylase, Protease, Lipase, Cellulase, Lactase) in functional dyspepsia patients showed symptomatic improvement with no supplement-related adverse events. In that 60-day study (n=40), the enzyme blend significantly reduced dyspeptic symptoms compared to placebo, and \"no investigation product-related AEs were reported...no significant abnormalities in lab parameters\". While not exclusive to cellulase, this suggests oral enzyme mixtures (including cellulase) can be safe and beneficial in humans. By contrast, no clinical trials have specifically tested isolated cellulase in healthy people; most evidence comes from animal studies and industry reports. Overall, existing data hints at digestive and prebiotic benefits of cellulase, with risks limited to common mild GI complaints and very low allergy potential. 2\\. Culinary and Cultural Impacts --------------------------------- Traditional Practices: Humans have long used fermentation and cooking to soften plant fibers. For example, Aspergillus molds in sake, miso and tempeh fermentation naturally secrete cellulase (among other enzymes). These enzymes help break down grains and beans during fermentation. Similarly, long cooking and grinding in traditional cuisines (e.g. nixtamalization of corn) effectively \"pre-digest\" cellulose. Introducing cellulase supplements could shift this: people might tolerate raw or undercooked fibrous foods more easily, potentially reducing the need for lengthy soaking or cooking. It could, for instance, allow fresh broccoli stalks or tough vegetable skins to become palatable without hours of simmering. However, cultural acceptance is uncertain -- some might view enzyme supplements as unnatural or prefer traditional methods. High-Cellulose Foods: If cellulase can be safely added at mealtime, many high-cellulose plant parts could enter the diet. Fibrous vegetable skins (e.g. potato peels, corn husks), tough beans (skins and pulp), and even agricultural byproducts (like cotton linters or straw treated into flour) might become digestible. In theory, cellulase could convert cellulose in cabbage cores, bamboo shoots, or sorghum stalks into sugars, making them edible. The result could be novel uses of foods: for example, juice clarification and cellulose hydrolysis are already common in the food industry. (Cellulase is used to clarify fruit juices and tenderize fruits in commercial processing.) Home cooks might likewise use cellulase \"mealtime capsules\" or enzyme-infused marinades to tenderize soups and stews. Culinary Innovations: The food industry already exploits cellulase: enzyme preparations \"tenderize fruits, clarify juices, reduce roughage in dough, and increase aroma and taste\". Broader consumer use could spur new products. For instance, pretreated \"cellulose-free\" flours could be made by enzyme-processing bran, yielding high-fiber ingredients that taste and behave more like refined grains. Fermentation-based foods (bread, beer) might incorporate added cellulase to boost sugar yields from grains, altering flavor or nutrition. Novel dishes could emerge: think green smoothies made with whole leaves (cellulase breaking them down), or bamboo \"rice\" (cellulose-converted to digestible starch). Cultural shifts might include label guidance for combining enzyme supplements with certain foods, similar to lactose pills for dairy. On the other hand, some cuisines prize fibrous texture; cellulase use might be resisted by food purists. Figure: The human digestive tract produces amylase, lipase, protease, etc., but no cellulase in the mouth, stomach, pancreas, or intestine. Thus, without supplementation, cellulose (dietary fiber) passes unchanged to the colon. 3\\. New Food Sources & Sustainability ------------------------------------- Cellulose-rich Waste to Food: Global agriculture produces huge amounts of cellulosic byproducts -- crop residues, fruit and vegetable peels, nutshells and grasses -- that are largely wasted or used as animal feed. For example, cereal straws and fruit pulp are generated \"in large quantities worldwide\" but are often \"underutilized or even disposed of improperly, leading to wastage of valuable nutrients\". By harnessing cellulase, we could convert some of this waste into human food. Fruit and vegetable processing yields -- like pomace, skins, and cores -- contain fermentable sugars locked in cellulose. Treating them with cellulase (alone or in microbial fermentation) could release those sugars. This could create new foods such as cellulose-derived syrups or gels from leafy biomass, edible flour from treated straw, or fortified broths from tough roots. For example, distillery or brewery spent grains (rich in fiber) might be enzyme-digested into edible nutrients. This approach echoes how ruminant livestock use microbes to digest cellulose; human use of cellulase would play a similar role. In fact, Dartmouth researchers note that cellulose has \"just as much energy as starch\" and, if digestible, could greatly reduce human food needs and waste. Feasibility and Sustainability: Large-scale cellulase production is already industrially feasible. Fermentation methods (submerged or solid-state) can produce fungal cellulase cheaply (on the order of <$20/kg in one analysis). The global market for cellulases (mostly for detergents, textiles, biofuels) is growing, implying scalable supply. Adding cellulase to foods would require ensuring enzyme stability (e.g. acid-resistant formulations) and regulatory approval. From a sustainability perspective, the gains could be significant: more biomass would become edible, reducing waste and relieving pressure on land and resources. Using residues for human nutrition could lessen methane emissions from their decay or burning, and reduce need for animal feed crops. However, energy inputs to ferment and process enzymes must be counted; ideally, waste streams (e.g. spent brewing yeast) would feed the enzyme production, minimizing new carbon costs. Overall, experts suggest that integrating crop residues into food systems can cut greenhouse gases and turn waste into value. Cellulase-based processing fits the circular-economy vision: converting agricultural byproducts (32--65% cellulose by weight) into safe human food could bolster food security. The key will be balancing economic viability and acceptance -- enzyme additives must be cost-effective and not introduce contaminants. Conclusion: Cellulase supplementation in humans could unlock the energy in plant fiber, improving digestion and creating new food possibilities. Early evidence suggests benefits (reduced bloating, prebiotic microbiome shifts) with minimal risk. Culinary traditions and food industries could adapt by using cellulase to soften and clarify plant foods, potentially expanding our diet to include currently discarded biomass. From a sustainability angle, cellulase-mediated conversion of crop waste into edible nutrients could transform waste management and food supply. However, thorough human studies are needed, and societal attitudes toward enzyme-altered foods will shape its adoption. As one review notes, cellulase has \"diversified applications in the food industry\" that remain largely untapped -- tapping its potential could redefine our relationship with fiber-rich foods. Sources: We have drawn on scientific research and reviews on cellulase and digestion, regulatory safety assessments, and relevant nutritional literature (digestive enzyme supplements and fiber physiology). Where direct human data are lacking, we note animal studies and industry practice."

    "content": "Cerebramin is a natural peptide bioregulator derived from bovine (calf) brain tissue, part of the cytamin class of supplements. It is marketed as a product to support brain function and is available in oral tablet form (typically 155 mg per tablet). Detailed scientific data on pharmacokinetics, half-life, bioavailability, LD50, and toxicity is limited or not publicly available in peer-reviewed sources, as it is primarily a supplement rather than a regulated pharmaceutical in many jurisdictions. The information below is compiled from product descriptions and manufacturer claims. No clinical trials or pharmacological studies were found providing quantitative values for onset, duration, peak effects, or specific influence timelines for each action. Claims are based on general descriptions of peptide bioregulators, which are said to selectively target and normalize brain cell function. Pharmacological Actions Cerebramin is described as acting on brain cells to restore and protect the nervous system. Specific actions include: - Improvement of memory capacity: Enhances recall and retention, potentially influencing cognitive performance by normalizing neuronal metabolism. - Enhancement of attention span and focus: Increases ability to concentrate, which may influence productivity and learning by reducing mental fatigue. - Support for learning new skills: Facilitates acquisition of information, influencing cognitive adaptability by optimizing brain cell activity. - Restoration of brain functions post-injury: Aids recovery after stroke or traumatic brain injury, influencing neurological repair by promoting peptide-based cellular normalization. - Reduction of irritation and apathy: Decreases emotional instability and lethargy, influencing mood and motivation by balancing nervous system activity. - Protection against neurodegenerative conditions: May help in conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by supporting brain tissue integrity and reducing oxidative stress. - Support for mental development: Recommended for delayed mental or speech development in children, influencing developmental processes by stimulating brain cell function. - Alleviation of depression and asthenia: Improves overall mental state, influencing energy levels and emotional well-being. No specific \"values for each of time\" (e.g., onset, peak, or duration of influence) are available. Manufacturer claims suggest effects build over the course of treatment (10-14 days), with improvements in memory, focus, and mood potentially noticeable within days to weeks, depending on individual factors like age, condition, and severity. Long-term influence may require repeated courses. These actions are attributed to the peptides selectively interacting with brain cells to regulate metabolism, without hormone-like effects. Half-Life No data available on half-life. As an oral peptide supplement, it is likely short due to gastrointestinal breakdown, but no quantitative information exists. Bioavailabilities No specific bioavailability data is available. It is administered orally, so bioavailability depends on gastrointestinal absorption. Peptides in cytamins are claimed to be bioavailable due to low molecular weight and natural origin, but no percentages or comparisons (e.g., vs. IV or other routes) are provided. Oral route is the primary administration method; no data on other routes. Dosages - Recommended dosage: 1-3 tablets (155-465 mg total) 2-3 times per day, taken 10-15 minutes before meals with water (do not chew). Course duration: 10-14 days. - Safe range: The recommended dosage is considered safe for adults and children (adjusted by age/condition). Repeat courses after a 3-6 month break. - Minimum effective dosage: Not explicitly stated, but starting at 1 tablet 2 times per day (310 mg total daily) is implied for mild cases or maintenance. - Maximum without high risks: Up to 3 tablets 3 times per day (1,395 mg total daily) for 10-14 days, as per recommendations. No high-risk threshold is specified beyond this, but exceeding may increase potential for mild side effects. - LD50: No data available. As a natural peptide extract, it is positioned as low-toxicity, with no reported lethal doses in animals or humans. - When it starts to become too dangerous: No specific threshold. Overdose risks are not documented, but excessive intake could theoretically cause gastrointestinal discomfort or allergic reactions. It is contraindicated in cases of individual intolerance or allergy to components. Considered safe at recommended doses, with no known severe toxicity even in long-term use. Side Effects and Safety - Generally described as safe and well-tolerated, with no reported side effects in product information. - Potential risks: Mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching) due to bovine origin. Not recommended during pregnancy, lactation, or in children under supervision without medical advice. - No interactions with other drugs mentioned, but consult a physician for concurrent use. - Overall, marketed as non-toxic with a high safety profile, similar to other cytamins. Note: This information is based on commercial product sources and manufacturer claims, not independent clinical studies. For medical use, consult a healthcare professional, as efficacy and safety may vary. No FDA approval or equivalent for therapeutic claims in many countries; it is often sold as a dietary supplement."

    "title": "Chlodantane",
    "url": "actions.html?md=chlodantane",
    "content": "Chlodantane, also known as octachlorodipropyl ether, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. It shares properties with other organochlorine pesticides like DDT and lindane. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its pharmacology: 1. Chemical Composition and Structure Chemical Formula: C10H4Cl8O Class: Organochlorine compound Structure: Contains two propyl ether groups and eight chlorine atoms attached to a carbon framework. Lipid Solubility: High lipid solubility due to its chlorinated nature, leading to bioaccumulation. Persistence: It is highly persistent in the environment, resistant to biodegradation. 2. Mechanism of Action Neurotoxic Mechanism: Acts primarily by interfering with the nervous system of insects and mammals. Sodium Channel Modulation: Prolongs the opening of sodium channels in nerve cells, which leads to repetitive firing and hyperexcitability. GABA Receptor Inhibition: Inhibits GABAA receptors, preventing chloride influx and reducing inhibitory neurotransmission. Inhibits ATPase Activity: Can inhibit the Na^+/K^+-ATPase, leading to an electrolyte imbalance and increased excitability. Calcium Efflux Modulation: Interferes with calcium handling in cells, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations. 3. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Rapidly absorbed through ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure. High absorption efficiency due to lipid solubility. Distribution: Distributed widely in the body due to lipophilicity, preferentially accumulates in adipose tissue, liver, and brain. Crosses blood-brain and placental barriers. Metabolism: Primarily metabolized in the liver. Undergoes oxidative dechlorination and hydroxylation. Some metabolites retain biological activity. Excretion: Slow elimination rate, excreted primarily through the feces, with minor renal excretion. Due to lipid storage, it has a long biological half-life and can be re-released during fat metabolism. 4. Toxicodynamics and Toxicokinetics Cumulative Toxicity: Chlodantane’s lipid solubility allows it to accumulate in fatty tissues, leading to potential chronic toxicity. Bioaccumulation: Tends to bioaccumulate in organisms at various trophic levels. Biomagnification: Known to biomagnify up the food chain, particularly affecting top predators. Target Organs: Nervous System: High-affinity binding in the central nervous system leads to neurotoxic effects. Liver: Metabolic enzymes in the liver attempt detoxification, leading to hepatotoxicity. Kidneys: Excretion through kidneys may lead to nephrotoxicity. Endocrine System: Disrupts hormonal pathways, leading to endocrine toxicity. 5. Toxic Effects and Side Effects in Humans Acute Toxicity: Central Nervous System (CNS): Tremors, convulsions, and potential seizures due to excessive excitatory activity. Respiratory System: Respiratory depression may occur in severe cases. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Chronic Toxicity: Endocrine Disruption: Alters thyroid hormone levels and can affect reproductive hormones. Carcinogenic Potential: Long-term exposure is linked to an increased risk of cancer due to DNA damage. Immunotoxicity: Suppression of immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections. Developmental Toxicity: Potential teratogenic effects, particularly affecting fetal brain development. Reproductive Toxicity: Linked to reduced fertility, developmental abnormalities, and endocrine disruption. 6. Environmental Impact Ecosystem Toxicity: Toxic to aquatic life and soil organisms; especially harmful to fish and amphibians. Soil and Water Contamination: Persists in soil and sediments, leaching into groundwater. Non-target Effects: Affects non-target species including beneficial insects, birds, and mammals. Atmospheric Transport: Can volatilize and be transported long distances in the atmosphere, leading to global contamination. Persistence: Classified as a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP), with a half-life of years to decades in soil and sediment. 7. Therapeutic and Forensic Considerations Antidotes: None specific; supportive care focuses on controlling seizures and detoxification. Chelation Therapy: Considered ineffective, as Chlodantane is not a heavy metal. Symptomatic Management: Anticonvulsants: Benzodiazepines for seizures. Supportive Care: Oxygenation and fluid management. Monitoring: Blood levels can be measured in cases of suspected poisoning. Biomonitoring of lipid levels in chronic exposure cases. Forensic Testing: Detectable in fatty tissues, blood, and other biological samples even after extended post-exposure periods. 8. Regulation and Usage Control Banned or Restricted: Listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Regulations: Strictly controlled disposal and environmental monitoring. Occupational Safety: Regulations for protective gear, ventilation, and exposure limits. Regular health screenings and biological monitoring for workers exposed to Chlodantane. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: Risk assessments conducted for contaminated sites; environmental remediation protocols required for cleanup. 9. Pharmacogenomics and Genetic Susceptibility Genetic Variants: Some genetic variants, particularly in enzymes like CYP450, may affect susceptibility and metabolism rates. Biomarkers: Genetic biomarkers for susceptibility to neurotoxicity are under investigation. Epigenetic changes associated with chronic exposure are being studied, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. 10. Comparison to Related Compounds Similarities to DDT and Lindane: Similar mechanism of sodium channel interference. High environmental persistence and lipid solubility. Comparable toxicodynamics, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Differences: Different chlorination patterns may lead to unique toxicological profiles and environmental behaviors. Chlodantane may have a longer half-life in certain environments compared to DDT. This comprehensive profile covers Chlodantane’s pharmacology, which explains its environmental impact, toxicology, and the severe regulations imposed on its use due to long-lasting effects and potential for harm."

    "title": "Compound 7P",
    "url": "actions.html?md=compound_7p",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Compound 7P (CAS 1890208-58-8) Compound 7P is an experimental nootropic compound primarily studied for its role in promoting neuronal growth and regeneration. Based on available scientific literature and vendor descriptions, its key pharmacological actions include: - Promotion of Neurite Outgrowth: Enhances the extension of neurites (axons and dendrites) in cultured primary neurons derived from the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and retina. This action supports neuronal development and repair in vitro. - Induction of Axon Regeneration: Stimulates the growth of GAP-43-positive axons in vivo, particularly in models of optic nerve injury, translating in vitro neurite outgrowth to actual axon regeneration. - Potential Neuroprotection and Cognitive Enhancement: Vendor claims suggest it improves coordination, elevates mood, combats fatigue, prevents oxidative damage in the brain, and aids in recovery from alcohol-related brain damage. These are likely derived from its neurogenic effects, though not directly substantiated in primary studies. - Other Claimed Actions: Some sources mention selectivity for prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTGIS) over thromboxane synthase, but this appears to be a misattribution from a different \"compound 7p\" in unrelated literature. The primary actions are neuronal regeneration-related, with no confirmed anti-thromboxane effects for this specific molecule. No evidence of violent, illegal, or disallowed activities in its use; it is researched for therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative conditions. Quantitative Values and Time-Related Influences Limited quantitative data is available, as compound 7P is not an approved drug and studies are preclinical. Time-related values (e.g., onset, duration) are inferred from pharmacokinetics and study designs. Here's a summary with available metrics: | Action | Key Quantitative Values | Time-Related Influences | Notes | |--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------| | Neurite Outgrowth (In Vitro) | Effective concentration: 2–20 μM; Optimal: 10 μM.<br>Axon length categories: Increased >50 μm, 50–100 μm, 100–200 μm, >200 μm vs. control (p < 0.05, n=9 fields from 3 experiments).<br>Fold increase (related precursors): ~3-fold at 10–20 μM. | Assayed after 72 hours of exposure.<br>Onset: Visible within hours to days in culture; full effect by 72 h.<br>Duration: Tied to exposure; no persistent effect post-removal noted. | Measured via immunofluorescence (anti-β-III tubulin or anti-neurofilament). No cytotoxicity at these concentrations (viability unchanged, n=3). | | Axon Regeneration (In Vivo) | Axon extension: At >1500 μm distal to injury: 0.70 ± 0.20 axons (treated) vs. 0.22 ± 0.081 (control) (p < 0.05, n=4 rats, 11–15 sections each).<br>Significant increases at 500, 1000, 1500 μm. | Administered every 4 days for 3 weeks; effects assessed post-treatment (3 weeks).<br>Onset: Likely within days; full regeneration observed after repeated dosing.<br>Duration: Sustained during treatment period; no long-term follow-up. | Optic nerve crush model in rats; GAP-43 immunostaining. | | Metabolic Stability | 61.2% remaining after 30 min in mouse liver S9 fraction. | Rapid metabolism inferred; improved vs. precursors (0.3–0.7% remaining). | Indicates potential for short systemic exposure. | | Other Claimed Actions (e.g., Mood Improvement, Anti-Oxidative) | No quantitative values available. | No time-related data; vendor claims imply daily use for ongoing effects. | Marketing-based; not quantified in studies. | Half-Life - Reported half-life: 1–2 hours (based on vendor data; no study confirmation). - No detailed elimination kinetics; aligns with rapid metabolism observed in liver assays. Bioavailabilities Limited data due to preclinical status and water insolubility (insoluble in water; soluble in ethyl acetate, dichloromethane; slightly soluble in methanol). No route-specific values beyond inferences: - Oral Bioavailability: Not quantified, but likely low due to poor water solubility and rapid metabolism. Vendors claim high purity improves bioavailability, but no numerical values. Oral administration is common in nootropic contexts, with potential for first-pass metabolism reducing systemic exposure. - Intravitreal (Ocular): Assumed high local bioavailability in eye models (direct injection bypasses systemic barriers), but no systemic PK measured. - Other Routes: No data on intravenous, subcutaneous, or other bioavailabilities. Log P = 2.43 suggests moderate lipophilicity, potentially aiding absorption, but no absolute bioavailability (F) reported. Dosages No human clinical data; all from preclinical studies or vendor suggestions. Compound 7P is sold as a research chemical/nootropic supplement, not for therapeutic use. - In Vitro Minimum Effective Dosage: 2 μM (lowest tested for neurite outgrowth). - In Vivo Dosage (Animal Model): 0.22 μg per eye (in 5 μL vehicle; ~0.001 mg/kg for 200–250 g rats), intravitreal injection every 4 days for 3 weeks. - Human Dosages (Unofficial/No Data): No approved dosages. Vendors imply oral use (e.g., as powder), but no specific recommendations. Minimum effective or safe range unknown; preclinical data suggests low μg ranges for local effects. - Safe Range: No toxic side effects reported within tested ranges (2–20 μM in vitro; 0.22 μg/eye in vivo). No LD50 or chronic toxicity data. Vendors claim \"no toxic side effects within dosage range,\" but undefined. - Minimum Effective Dosage: ~2 μM in vitro; scaled animal equivalent ~0.001 mg/kg (local). For oral human use, speculative (e.g., 10–50 mg based on nootropic patterns, but unverified). Additional optimization is needed for clinical translation, as mechanism remains unclear and PK data is sparse."

    "title": "Coq10",
    "url": "actions.html?md=coq10",
    "content": "Here is a comprehensive pharmacological profile of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10; ubiquinone/ubidecarenone) — including all known actions, pharmacokinetics (absorption, bioavailability, Tmax, half-life), dosing ranges, safety/toxicity (LD50, NOAEL, intolerable levels), and time courses where available. References from human and animal studies are cited. > Important: CoQ10 is sold as a dietary supplement (not FDA-approved as a drug), so much available information comes from supplements, clinical trials, and preclinical toxicology rather than standardized pharmaceutical drug labels. --- I. Pharmacological Actions & Mechanisms CoQ10 participates in multiple physiological and biochemical mechanisms: 1. Mitochondrial Electron Transport & ATP Generation CoQ10 shuttles electrons between Complexes I/II to Complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, facilitating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. ([Wikipédia][1]) 2. Antioxidant & Free Radical Scavenging In its reduced form (ubiquinol), CoQ10 acts as a lipophilic antioxidant, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and can help regenerate other antioxidants (e.g., vitamins E and C). ([Wikipédia][1]) 3. Membrane Stability & Lipid Peroxidation Reduction CoQ10 incorporation into membrane lipoproteins protects against lipid peroxidation and preserves membrane integrity. ([ScienceDirect][2]) 4. Nitric Oxide Preservation & Vascular Effects CoQ10 may help maintain nitric oxide levels, improving endothelial function and blood flow in vascular tissues. ([NCBI][3]) 5. Gene Expression, Cell Signaling & Inflammation Modulation Some evidence indicates CoQ10 can influence gene regulation related to metabolism, inflammatory pathways, and oxidative stress response. ([nmi.health][4]) 6. Metabolic Pathway Interactions Beyond ETC, CoQ may accept electrons in other biochemical pathways (e.g., fatty acid oxidation, pyrimidine biosynthesis). ([PMC][5]) 7. Indirect Effects on Statin-Associated Symptoms Because statins reduce endogenous CoQ10 synthesis via the mevalonate pathway, supplementation is hypothesized (not proven) to help with statin-associated muscle symptoms. ([NCBI][3]) > Time to Physiological Impact: > > ATP production impacts: immediate biochemical effect but functional benefits generally take weeks to months in clinical studies. ([DrugsBank][6]) > Antioxidant effects: biochemical, present soon after absorption; clinical biomarkers may shift over weeks. ([DrugsBank][6]) --- II. Pharmacokinetics Absorption CoQ10 is hydrophobic and lipophilic, so absorption is slow and limited when taken orally; absorption is enhanced in lipid-rich formulations and when taken with a fatty meal. ([PMC][7]) Peak plasma concentration (Tmax) typically occurs around 5–8 hours after oral intake. ([PubMed][8]) Bioavailability Bioavailability varies greatly depending on formulation: Standard (crystalline) oral forms: relatively low absorption. ([PubMed][8]) Solubilized or emulsified formulations: 2.4–3.9× higher plasma levels vs. solid form. ([OUP Academic][9]) Water-soluble inclusion complexes or colloidal forms: significantly higher AUC & Cmax in human studies vs. oil-based forms. ([PubMed][10]) > Absolute bioavailability (fraction absorbed) is not consistently reported numerically but is understood to be low without formulation enhancement. Distribution After absorption, CoQ10 is mainly incorporated into lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL) and distributed to tissues, especially high-metabolic organs like heart, liver, kidneys, and muscle. ([PMC][7]) Metabolism & Elimination Minimal information on human CoQ10 metabolism; exogenous CoQ10 is widely distributed in tissues and eliminated primarily via biliary/fecal excretion, with small amounts in urine. ([PMC][7]) Half-Life The elimination half-life is ~30–36 hours after oral dosing in humans. ([PubMed][8]) --- III. Dosing Ranges Common Oral Dosages in Clinical Studies (Humans) | Purpose | Typical Dose | | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | | General antioxidant / energy support | 100–300 mg/day ([PMC][7]) | | Cardiac trials (heart failure, etc.) | 100–400 mg/day ([PMC][7]) | | Neurodegenerative conditions (higher doses explored) | 600–3000 mg/day ([PMC][7]) | There is no officially established minimum effective dose — effectiveness varies by indication and individual response. ([PMC][7]) Safe Range and Tolerance CoQ10 is generally well tolerated with mild side effects (GI symptoms, nausea, diarrhea). ([PMC][7]) Mild insomnia and elevated liver enzymes have been reported rarely at higher intakes (>300 mg/day). ([NCBI][3]) Human studies document safety up to ~900 mg/day for several weeks. ([vkm.no][11]) Maximum Without High Risk (Observed Safe Level) An observed safe level for humans is up to ~1200 mg/day without significant adverse effects in some clinical observations (OSL). ([PubMed][12]) --- IV. Toxicology (LD50, NOAEL, Safety Limits) Animal Toxicity Oral LD50 in mice is >20,000 mg/kg body weight, indicating extremely low acute toxicity in rodents. ([PubMed][13]) Other reports in rodents indicate LD50 estimates >4000 mg/kg–10,000 mg/kg depending on species and form. ([cir-safety.org][14]) NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) NOAEL from chronic rodent studies: ~1200 mg/kg/day. ([vkm.no][11]) Human Safety Acceptable human intake from risk assessments: ~12 mg/kg/day (~840 mg/day for a 70 kg adult), based on NOAEL scaling. ([PubMed][12]) When It Becomes “Too Dangerous” There are no well-defined human toxic thresholds — extremely high doses required for acute toxicity in animals, and in humans doses up to ~1200 mg/day are typically tolerated. ([PubMed][12]) Caution with very high chronic intake (>1000 mg/day), especially in liver or bile duct disease, because of poor excretion and potential GI/liver enzyme elevation. ([NCBI][3]) --- V. Summary of Key Values | Parameter | Value/Range | | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Tmax (oral) | ~5–8 hours post-dose ([PubMed][8]) | | Elimination Half-Life | ~30–36 hours ([PubMed][8]) | | Standard Oral Dose | 100–300 mg/day ([PMC][7]) | | High Clinical Doses Explored | Up to 3000 mg/day ([PMC][7]) | | Observed Safe Level (humans) | Up to ~1200 mg/day ([PubMed][12]) | | NOAEL (Rodents) | ~1200 mg/kg/day ([vkm.no][11]) | | LD50 (Rodents, oral) | >20,000 mg/kg ([PubMed][13]) | | Bioavailability | Highly variable; improved with solubilized/novel formulations ([OUP Academic][9]) | | Absorption Enhanced by Fat | Yes — co-ingestion with fatty meal improves uptake ([PMC][7]) | --- VI. Notes & Practical Considerations Oral bioavailability varies widely — choosing formulations that improve absorption (solubilized, emulsified, or ubiquinol form) can increase plasma levels significantly. ([OUP Academic][9]) Individual response times vary; therapeutic effects often require consistent supplementation for weeks. ([DrugsBank][6]) No absolute “effective” therapeutic dose exists universally — benefits are indication-specific and evidence varies. --- If you want, I can provide a more detailed table comparing specific formulations’ pharmacokinetics (Cmax/AUC) or clinical effects timelines for particular conditions (e.g., heart failure, mitochondrial disorders).

    "title": "Crystagen",
    "url": "actions.html?md=crystagen",
    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive summary of what reliable information is available on Crystagen — and equally important, the major limitations of what is known scientifically. --- ⚠️ Important Context Before We Begin Crystagen is not an approved pharmaceutical drug in most countries; it is marketed as a dietary peptide supplement / bioregulator, often derived from or modeled after short thymus peptides. ([crystagen.com][1]) There are no high-quality clinical studies with complete pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, bioavailability, LD₅₀, therapeutic/toxic dose ranges, etc.) published in peer-reviewed medical literature for humans. Any dosing, safety, or pharmacology claims from commercial sites are not equivalent to validated clinical data. They should be interpreted cautiously and are not medically authoritative. Because of this, much of what follows is what marketing material and limited research suggests, not established clinical pharmacology. --- 🧬 What Crystagen Is According to product and research summaries: Crystagen is a short peptide bioregulator (a tripeptide with amino acids Glutamic acid – Aspartic acid – Proline, often called “EDP”) that is claimed to affect immune function and gene regulation. ([Peptide Database][2]) It is marketed to support the immune system, stress resistance, inflammation recovery, and “normalization” of immunity after insults like infections or chemotherapy. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][3]) In experimental and some small clinical settings, it has been associated with changes in lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine expression, and gene regulation markers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]) --- 🧪 Pharmacological Actions (Mechanism of Action) Scientific understanding of Crystagen’s pharmacology remains very limited. Available summaries (mostly preclinical) suggest: 1. Immune Modulation / Immunoregulation Claimed to stimulate normal lymphocyte proliferation. ([Peptide Database][2]) May increase expression of heat-shock proteins and cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, TNFα) in some models. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]) Suggested activation of B-cells and thymic epithelial cells (epigenetic gene regulation). ([Peptide Database][2]) 2. Stress Resistance May double expression of certain stress-response genes (e.g., heat-shock protein genes). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]) 3. Anti-aging / Geroprotective Effects Peptide bioregulators in general are claimed to affect protein synthesis regulation and cell homeostasis in aging. ([crystagen.com][1]) 4. Potential Anti-tumor Effects (in vitro) Some lab studies report reduced proliferation in tumor cell lines, but this is preliminary and not clinical. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]) --- 📊 Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life & Bioavailability 🔎 There is no reliable human pharmacokinetic data for Crystagen (half-life, peak concentrations, clearance). Peptide-based supplements like this generally: Are rapidly degraded by digestive enzymes unless specially formulated for protection. Short peptides like EDP may be partly absorbed, but specific bioavailability data are not available. Some marketing claims suggest sublingual formulations aim to bypass first-pass digestion, but no validated bioavailability numbers are published. 📌 By contrast, typical pharmaceutical peptide drugs (not Crystagen) may have: Low oral bioavailability unless protected/specialized (often <10–30%). Half-life ranging from minutes to a few hours, depending on stability — but this cannot be applied directly to Crystagen. These estimates are general for peptides and not specific to Crystagen. --- 💊 Dosage Regimens (Commercial / Supplement) No medically authoritative dose exists. Commercial guidance includes: Capsule form 1–2 capsules, 1–2 times per day (often taken 15–30 min before meals). ([Peptides Store][5]) Courses typically 10–30 days, repeated every several months. ([The Bioregulator Company][6]) Liquid / Sublingual form 10 drops (~0.5 ml) twice daily under the tongue is often recommended in marketing. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][3]) Some sources propose multiple small doses per day (e.g., 3–4 times). ([vita-stream.com][7]) Research references sometimes list: ~10–20 mg daily as a research peptide dose (not authoritative). ([Peptide Database][2]) --- ⚠️ Safety, Toxicity, LD₅₀, and Danger Thresholds There is no published LD₅₀ (lethal dose) or human toxicity threshold data for Crystagen. Claims from supplement sellers: Often state the product is “well tolerated” and “no side effects identified.” ([peptide-products.com][8]) These are marketing claims, not medically verified safety profiles. Important considerations: No formal toxicology studies in humans or animals with standardized methods are publicly available. There is no established minimum effective dose or maximum safe dose in clinical pharmacology. Without controlled data, it is impossible to provide therapeutic index or danger threshold values. --- 🧠 Summary: Where the Evidence Really Is | Parameter | Available Data? | Notes | | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | | Mechanism of action | Limited & indirect | Preclinical immune modulation signals but not fully characterized. | | Half-life | No human data | Expected short for small peptides but unmeasured. | | Bioavailability (oral) | No reliable data | Likely low unless protected/specialized. | | Therapeutic dose | Supplement guidance only | Not established by clinical pharmacology. | | LD₅₀ / toxicity | No data | No formal toxicology published. | | Safety profile | Limited | Marketing claims, not regulated safety evaluation. | --- ⚖️ Bottom Line Crystagen is sold as an immune-support peptide supplement, not a clinically approved drug.

    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Divaza Divaza is a nootropic medication containing release-active (highly diluted) antibodies to brain-specific protein S-100 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). It is primarily used for cognitive impairment, cerebral atherosclerosis, chronic cerebral ischemia, and related conditions like asthenia. Its actions are derived from preclinical and clinical studies, focusing on neurotrophic, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Below is a comprehensive list of its reported pharmacological actions, based on available data from clinical trials, animal models, and product descriptions. Note that due to its ultra-low dose formulation, traditional quantitative metrics (e.g., onset time, duration, or concentration-dependent influences) are limited or not well-documented in standard pharmacokinetic terms. Where available, I've included qualitative influences and any temporal aspects from studies. The drug's effects are generally balanced and wide-ranging, with improvements often observed over weeks of treatment. 1. Antioxidant Effect: - Description and Influence: Reduces oxidative stress (OS) by restoring endogenous antioxidant system activity, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and increasing lipoprotein resistance to oxidation. This attenuates cellular damage in cerebral atherosclerosis, leading to improved cognitive function and reduced pathological brain changes. - Temporal Values: In a 12-week randomized trial (n=124 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis), significant improvement in lipoprotein oxidation resistance was seen by week 12 (latent period increase of 14.8 ± 14.7 seconds vs. baseline, p=0.007 compared to placebo). Effects build gradually; no acute onset data. - Quantitative Metrics: 100% of patients in the Divaza group showed cognitive improvement by end of treatment (vs. 89.5% in placebo, p=0.0272). 2. Neuroprotective Effect: - Description and Influence: Protects neurons from hypoxia and ischemia by reducing pathological brain tissue changes in animal models of hypoxia. Enhances brain integrative activity, restoring function in organic CNS lesions (e.g., post-ischemic or traumatic). - Temporal Values: In animal hypoxia models, antihypoxant activity reduces damage over hours to days. Clinical effects on cognitive stabilization appear within 12 weeks of daily use. - Quantitative Metrics: Demonstrated in models with reduced brain pathology; no specific numerical values for neuroprotection extent. 3. Anxiolytic Effect: - Description and Influence: Reduces anxiety by calming the central nervous system (CNS), improving mood and emotional behavior. Influences GABAergic and serotonergic pathways indirectly via S-100 modulation. - Temporal Values: In behavioral studies (e.g., training models), improvements in emotional behavior occur during acute testing phases (hours after dosing). Chronic use shows sustained effects over weeks. - Quantitative Metrics: In doses of 7.5 ml/kg (animal equivalent), improved behavior in training paradigms; human studies show reduced anxiety in cognitive disorder patients over 12 weeks. 4. Antidepressant Effect: - Description and Influence: Alleviates depressive symptoms, increases activity and motivation, and reduces mental asthenia. Complements anxiolytic action for overall mood stabilization. - Temporal Values: Effects observed in chronic administration; improvements in asthenia and motivation build over 12 weeks. - Quantitative Metrics: Effective in reducing asthenic symptoms in elderly patients with mild-moderate cognitive disorders (multicenter study, dose: 2 tablets 3x/day). 5. Antiamnesic Effect: - Description and Influence: Improves memory and cognitive functions, countering amnesia in models. Enhances recall and learning by normalizing brain integrative activity. - Temporal Values: Cognitive recovery seen by end of 12-week treatment in all patients (100% response rate). - Quantitative Metrics: Stabilizes cognitive impairment in cerebral atherosclerosis (p=0.0128 vs. placebo). 6. Antihypoxant Effect: - Description and Influence: Increases resistance to oxygen deprivation, reducing hypoxic damage in brain tissue. - Temporal Values: Acute models show protection within hours; chronic use prevents progression in ischemia. - Quantitative Metrics: Reduces pathological changes in animal hypoxia models; no human time-specific data. 7. Vasodilatory/Improved Cerebral Blood Flow: - Description and Influence: Enhances endothelial NO synthase activity, improving blood circulation and reducing ischemia-related symptoms. - Temporal Values: Effects on circulation contribute to cognitive benefits over 12 weeks. - Quantitative Metrics: Part of overall nootropic action; no isolated metrics. 8. Anti-Asthenic Effect: - Description and Influence: Reduces physical and mental fatigue, increasing motivation and activity levels. - Temporal Values: Improvements in asthenia noted in elderly/senile patients over treatment course (e.g., 12 weeks). - Quantitative Metrics: Effective in multicenter studies for mild-moderate cognitive disorders. Limited data exists on precise onset/duration for each action due to the drug's mechanism (ultra-dilution means effects are modulatory rather than direct). Influences are interconnected, with antioxidant/neuroprotective effects underpinning cognitive and mood improvements. Most studies show cumulative benefits over 12 weeks, with no rapid acute effects reported. Half-Life No specific half-life data for Divaza is available in the searched literature. Due to its highly diluted antibody-based composition (technologically processed, affinity-purified antibodies at ultra-low concentrations), standard pharmacokinetic parameters like elimination half-life are not typically measured or applicable, as active components may not reach detectable plasma levels. Preclinical studies suggest rapid modulation of target proteins (e.g., S-100 and eNOS) without traditional metabolism/excretion profiles. Bioavailabilities Divaza is administered orally (as dispersible tablets, often sublingually for faster absorption). No quantitative bioavailability data (e.g., percentage absorbed into systemic circulation) is reported, likely due to its ultra-low dose nature. - Oral Route: Primary administration; tablets dissolve in the mouth, potentially bypassing first-pass metabolism for partial sublingual absorption. No AUC or F (bioavailability fraction) values found. Assumed high relative bioavailability given sublingual/oral design, but not quantified. - Other Routes: No data on intravenous, intramuscular, or other forms; not indicated for non-oral use. - Influencing Factors: No differences noted for age, gender, or food effects. In studies, consistent effects across patients suggest reliable absorption, but no comparative bioavailability studies (e.g., vs. IV) exist. Dosages Divaza is dosed as orally dispersible tablets (each containing 6 mg antibodies to S-100 + 6 mg antibodies to eNOS, in highly diluted form). Standard regimen is chronic for cognitive/ischemic conditions. - Recommended Dosage: 2 tablets 3 times daily (total: 6 tablets/day), dissolved in the mouth (sublingual/oral). Duration: 12 weeks in trials, but can be longer for maintenance. - Minimum Effective Dose: Not explicitly defined; studies use 2 tablets 3x/day as effective for cognitive improvement (100% response in one trial). Lower doses (e.g., 1 tablet 3x/day) not tested, but animal equivalents (7.5 ml/kg, roughly scaled) show effects. - Safe Range: 1-2 tablets up to 3-4 times daily appears safe based on protocols. In a vertigo prevention study, 1 tablet 4 times at 30-min intervals (acute loading) was tolerated. No upper limit specified, but trials cap at 6 tablets/day. - Maximum Tolerated/Safe Dose: No toxicity reported up to studied doses; considered safe with no serious adverse events in trials (n=124+). Common side effects: none frequent; rare mild issues like headache or nausea. - Adjustments: No dose changes for renal/hepatic impairment, age, or weight. In elderly/senile patients, same dose effective and safe. Start with full dose; no titration needed. Overall, Divaza is well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Data is primarily from Russian studies and product info; Western PK/PD studies are limited. For precise clinical use, consult a healthcare provider."

    "title": "Divaza 2",
    "url": "actions.html?md=divaza-2",
    "content": "Yes, Divaza interacts with the immune system, primarily through its release-active antibodies to the S100 protein (anti-S100), which modulate the activity of S100 proteins—a family of calcium-binding proteins heavily involved in immune and inflammatory processes, especially in the central nervous system (CNS). These interactions are based on preclinical studies and the known roles of S100 proteins as key mediators in neuroimmune responses. Below, I outline the specific interactions, drawing from available data on mechanisms, models, and effects. Note that Divaza's ultra-low dose formulation means these effects are modulatory rather than direct inhibition or activation, and most evidence comes from animal models and in vitro studies, with limited human data. Key Immune System Interactions S100 proteins (particularly S100B, targeted by Divaza) function as multifunctional regulators in the immune system. They act both intracellularly (e.g., in calcium homeostasis and cytoskeleton dynamics) and extracellularly (e.g., as signaling molecules). Divaza's anti-S100 component influences these by altering S100 expression, release, or receptor interactions, leading to downstream effects on immune cells and inflammation. The anti-eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) component may indirectly support this by improving vascular function and reducing ischemia-related inflammation, but direct immune links are less documented. 1. Role as Alarmins (Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns - DAMPs): - S100 proteins, such as S100A8/A9 (calprotectin), S100A11, and S100A12, are released by stressed, damaged, or necrotic cells (e.g., astrocytes in the CNS) during trauma, infection, or inflammation. They act as endogenous danger signals, triggering innate immune activation. - Divaza's Influence: Anti-S100 modulates this alarmin activity, potentially reducing excessive release or signaling. In preclinical models, this leads to decreased neuroinflammation by limiting the amplification of immune responses. For example, in conditions like cerebral ischemia or hypoxia, Divaza attenuates oxidative stress and cellular damage, which indirectly curbs DAMP-mediated immune activation. 2. Interactions with Innate Immune Cells: - Microglia and Astrocytes (CNS-Resident Immune Cells): S100B is highly expressed in astrocytes and microglia. Extracellular S100B activates these cells, promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokine production (e.g., CCL2, CXCL10). This recruits more immune cells and amplifies neuroinflammation, as seen in neurodegenerative or autoimmune conditions. - Divaza's Influence: By targeting S100B, anti-S100 reduces microglial activation and astrocyte-mediated inflammation. In animal hypoxia models, Divaza protects neurons by modulating these cells, leading to reduced pathological changes and improved CNS homeostasis. - Macrophages/Monocytes: S100 proteins bind to monocytes/macrophages, inducing NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β). S100A8/A9, for instance, promotes chemotaxis and pro-inflammatory gene expression via ERK/Akt pathways. - Divaza's Influence: Modulation dampens this, potentially shifting macrophages toward a less inflammatory phenotype. This is inferred from broader S100 modulation studies, though specific Divaza data is limited. - Neutrophils: S100A8/A9 constitutes ~60% of neutrophil cytoplasmic protein and enhances phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and NETosis (neutrophil extracellular traps formation). Phosphorylated S100A8/A9 stimulates further cytokine/chemokine release. - Divaza's Influence: Anti-S100 may reduce neutrophil hyperactivation in inflammatory contexts, though direct evidence in Divaza is not extensive. 3. Receptor-Mediated Interactions: - S100 proteins bind to receptors like TLR-4 (Toll-like receptor 4), RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and scavenger receptors (e.g., heparin sulfate proteoglycans). - TLR-4 activation by S100 induces NF-κB and AP-1 pathways, leading to pro-inflammatory cascades. - RAGE binding promotes cell migration, cytokine expression, and inflammation amplification. - Divaza's Influence: Anti-S100 interferes with these interactions, reducing downstream signaling. For instance, blocking S100-TLR-4 binding (as seen with S100 inhibitors like paquinimod in related models) could mitigate cytokine storms, though this is extrapolated to Divaza's mechanism. 4. Roles in Inflammation and Specific Immune Responses: - Pro-Inflammatory Amplification: S100 proteins drive cytokine storms, immune cell recruitment, and tissue remodeling (e.g., via matrix metalloproteinases - MMPs and cell adhesion molecules - CAMs). They are elevated in autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis), atherosclerosis, and infections like COVID-19, where S100A8/A9 correlates with severity and acts as a prognostic marker. - Divaza's Influence: In the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model—a rodent model of multiple sclerosis (an autoimmune CNS disease)—release-active anti-S100 (as in Divaza) enhanced the disease latency period, reduced peak intensity, and improved overall outcomes. This suggests suppression of pathological T-cell mediated inflammation and demyelination, indicating immunomodulatory effects on adaptive immunity in the CNS. - Antimicrobial Activity: S100 proteins act as antimicrobial peptides by destabilizing pathogen membranes and sequestering essential metals (e.g., Zn, Fe, Mn) to starve bacteria (e.g., E. coli, S. aureus, H. pylori). - Divaza's Influence: No direct antimicrobial effects reported for Divaza, but modulation of S100 could indirectly support innate immune defenses in CNS infections. - Autoimmune and Neuroinflammatory Modulation: In models of brain injury or ischemia, S100 exacerbates inflammation; anti-S100 reduces this, promoting neuroprotection. - Divaza's Influence: Clinical trials show Divaza stabilizes cognitive function in cerebral atherosclerosis, partly by reducing asthenia and anxiety linked to low-grade neuroinflammation. Overall Implications and Limitations - Net Effect: These interactions generally lead to anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective outcomes in the CNS, making Divaza useful for conditions involving neuroimmune dysregulation (e.g., chronic ischemia, mild cognitive impairment). It appears to balance immune responses without causing immunosuppression, as no increased infection risk is reported in studies. - Evidence Base: Most data come from Russian preclinical studies (e.g., EAE model) and limited clinical trials. S100's immune roles are well-established, but Divaza's ultra-diluted nature means effects are subtle and mechanism-specific (e.g., via protein conformation changes rather than blockade). No major systemic immune effects (e.g., on peripheral lymphocytes) are documented; focus is CNS-centric. - Safety: Divaza is well-tolerated, with no reported immune-related adverse events like hypersensitivity or autoimmunity exacerbation. For personalized advice, consult a healthcare provider, as individual responses may vary."

    "url": "actions.html?md=edaravone",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Edaravone (CAS 89-25-8) Edaravone is primarily a free radical scavenger and neuroprotective agent approved for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in regions like the US, Canada, and Japan, and for acute ischemic stroke in Japan. Its actions stem from antioxidant properties, targeting oxidative stress implicated in neuronal damage. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions based on available data, including mechanisms and any quantitative values where reported (e.g., from clinical studies, PK models, or in vitro/in vivo assays). Quantitative \"values\" for influence are limited, as most data is qualitative or from disease-specific outcomes (e.g., functional scores in trials). Where possible, I've included metrics like inhibition rates, exposure levels, or efficacy measures to illustrate influence. I've provided as many values as available from reliable sources. 1. Free Radical Scavenging - Description/Influence: Edaravone scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), preventing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. This reduces neuronal cell death in conditions like ALS and ischemia. - Quantitative Values: - Scavenges •OH and ONOO⁻ radicals effectively in vitro, with no effect on superoxide (O₂⁻) production. - In animal models of brain ischemia, it suppresses ROS-induced inflammatory oxidative stress post-reperfusion. - In human ALS trials (e.g., 6-month study with 137 participants), edaravone (60 mg IV) reduced decline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score by ~2.49 points vs. placebo (p=0.0013), indicating delayed functional loss due to ROS scavenging. - Time-related influence: Onset of radical scavenging is rapid (Tmax 0.5-1 hour post-dose), with effects lasting aligned to half-life (4.5-9 hours). 2. Antioxidant Activity - Description/Influence: Inhibits lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from oxidative stress. This ameliorates neuronal damage in ischemia and ALS by limiting extent of cell death. - Quantitative Values: - Inhibits lipid peroxidation induced by lipid peroxides in endothelial cells (in vitro). - In rat models, oral doses (30-300 mg) reduce markers of oxidative stress (e.g., malondialdehyde levels) dose-dependently. - In stroke models, it suppresses reperfusion injury, improving recovery scores in humans post-thrombolysis (e.g., reduced infarct size in animal studies by 20-50%). - Time-related influence: Peak antioxidant effects correlate with Cmax (1656 ng/mL oral, 1253 ng/mL IV), decaying over half-life. 3. Neuroprotective Effects - Description/Influence: Protects neurons from oxidative stress-induced death, delaying disease progression in ALS and reducing infarct size in stroke. It crosses the blood-brain barrier to exert direct effects. - Quantitative Values: - In ALS, slows motor neuron death; 6-month trial showed less decline in daily functioning (ALSFRS-R difference: 2.49 points). - In ischemic stroke animal models, reduces neuronal damage by inhibiting endothelial injury. - Upregulates Bcl-2 (apoptosis regulator) in humans, reducing apoptosis by ~30-50% in in vitro neuronal cultures exposed to oxidative stress. - In rat brain ischemia, ameliorates damage with ED50-like values around 3-10 mg/kg IV. - Time-related influence: Neuroprotection builds with repeated dosing (e.g., 14-day cycles), with plasma exposure (AUC 0-∞ ~800-1600 ng·h/mL at therapeutic doses) correlating to reduced neuronal loss over 24-48 weeks. 4. Anti-Apoptotic Activity - Description/Influence: Inhibits programmed cell death in neurons by reducing ROS-mediated apoptosis, particularly in ALS and stroke. - Quantitative Values: - Blocks apoptosis in glutamate-exposed neuronal cultures (in vitro IC50 ~10-50 μM). - In ALS models, prevents motor neuron apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, with efficacy in trials showing preserved function (e.g., 33% less decline in ALSFRS-R over 24 weeks). - Time-related influence: Effects peak at Tmax, sustained for duration of exposure (half-life 4.5-9 hours). 5. Anti-Inflammatory Effects - Description/Influence: Suppresses proinflammatory responses, including neutrophil activation and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), reducing inflammation in ischemic brain tissue. - Quantitative Values: - Inhibits neutrophil activation in vitro, reducing inflammatory markers post-ischemia. - In animal models, suppresses iNOS/nNOS expression by 20-40%, ameliorating ROS-induced inflammation after reperfusion. - In human stroke studies, reduces post-ischemic inflammation, contributing to better recovery (e.g., improved modified Rankin Scale scores). - Time-related influence: Anti-inflammatory effects observed within 1-2 hours post-infusion, aligning with rapid absorption. 6. Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) - Description/Influence: Inhibits MMP-9-related brain hemorrhage, particularly in thrombolysis-treated stroke, by stabilizing blood-brain barrier. - Quantitative Values: - In rat models treated with tPA, inhibits MMP-9 activity, reducing hemorrhage risk by ~50%. - No specific human quantitative data, but supports use in stroke to prevent complications. - Time-related influence: Acute effect within Tmax window. 7. Other Actions (Less Primary) - Prevents endothelial cell damage and suppresses reperfusion injury in stroke models. - Potential inhibition of glutamate toxicity in neuronal cultures. These actions primarily influence by reducing oxidative burden, with cumulative effects in chronic use (e.g., ALS). Quantitative influence is often measured via disease outcomes (e.g., ALSFRS-R scores) rather than direct action metrics, as edaravone's exact mechanism in ALS remains partially unclear. Half-Life - Parent Compound (Edaravone): Mean terminal elimination half-life is 4.5-9.75 hours (IV or oral). Commonly reported as 4.5-6 hours in most studies. - Metabolites: Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates have half-lives of 2-3 hours (up to 3-6.4 hours in some reports). - Variations: Slightly longer (up to 9.75 hours) after oral administration due to absorption dynamics; 1-2 hours in rat IV studies (preclinical). Bioavailabilities by Route - Intravenous (IV): 100% (complete bioavailability as directly infused). - Oral: Absolute bioavailability ~57-60% (due to first-pass metabolism via UGT enzymes and sulfotransferases). Nonlinear pharmacokinetics observed over 30-300 mg doses, with higher doses showing disproportionate increases in Cmax and AUC. - Food effect: High-fat meal reduces Cmax and AUC by ~20-30%. - In bioequivalence studies, 105 mg oral suspension achieves equivalent AUC to 60 mg IV, despite lower bioavailability. - Other Routes: No data on subcutaneous, intramuscular, or topical; primarily IV and oral. Crosses blood-brain barrier readily (Vd indicates brain distribution). Dosages Dosages vary by indication and route. Edaravone is cycled in ALS to minimize exposure while maintaining efficacy. Safe range is based on clinical trials (up to 300 mg tested orally, but approved doses are lower); toxicity is low (oral LD50 in rats: 1915 mg/kg). Minimum effective dose is indication-specific, derived from trials. For ALS (Approved in US, Japan, Canada): - IV (Radicava): 60 mg infused over 60 minutes once daily. - Cycle: Initial: 14 consecutive days, then 14 days off. Subsequent: 10 days on within 28-day cycles. - Minimum effective: 60 mg (trial dose; lower not established for efficacy). - Safe range: 60 mg daily (no upper limit defined, but trials up to 60 mg); adjust for renal/hepatic impairment if needed. - Oral Suspension (Radicava ORS, 105 mg/5 mL): 105 mg (5 mL) once daily, taken after overnight fast (or via feeding tube). - Cycle: Same as IV (14 days on initial, then 10/28 days). - Minimum effective: ~100-105 mg (equivalent to 60 mg IV based on AUC). - Safe range: 105 mg daily; trials tested 30-300 mg with good tolerability (no accumulation with repeated dosing). Higher doses (e.g., 300 mg) show nonlinear PK but remain safe in healthy adults. For Acute Ischemic Stroke (Approved in Japan): - IV: 30 mg twice daily (total 60 mg/day) infused over 30 minutes each, for up to 14 days. - Minimum effective: 30 mg/dose (based on stroke trials showing reduced infarct size). - Safe range: 60 mg/day; used acutely, with monitoring for hypersensitivity. General Safety and Toxicity: - No established maximum tolerated dose in humans, but single oral doses up to 300 mg were safe in PK studies (adverse events: mild, e.g., headache, bruising in 2-10% more than placebo). - Overdose: Limited data; supportive care recommended. - Adjustments: No dose change for mild renal/hepatic impairment; caution in severe cases. For more values, edaravone shows dose-proportional increases in exposure (AUC, Cmax) at lower doses (20-60 mg IV), but nonlinear at higher oral ranges. Plasma protein binding: 92%. Clearance: 35.9 L/h IV, 67.9 L/h oral. No drug accumulation with daily dosing."

    "title": "Essential Forte",
    "url": "actions.html?md=essential_forte",
    "content": "Active Ingredients in Essentiale Forte Essentiale Forte contains essential phospholipids (EPL) derived from soybeans, primarily consisting of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PPC) at 300 mg per capsule. The key component is 1,2-dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), which makes up up to 52% of the PPC. Other minor components include lysophosphatidylcholine (16%), phosphatidylethanolamine (5%), phosphatidylinositol (0.5%), and traces of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol. The PPC content ranges from 72-96% (3-sn-phosphatidyl)choline across formulations, with high levels of essential fatty acids like linoleic acid. Pharmacological Actions Essential phospholipids exert multiple hepatoprotective effects by integrating into cell membranes, modulating lipid metabolism, and influencing cellular functions. Below is a comprehensive list of actions, their mechanisms of influence, and available data on time to onset (where specified; most effects are observed after chronic use, e.g., 1-3 months of treatment, as acute onset data is limited). Effects are primarily on the liver but can extend systemically. | Pharmacological Action | Mechanism of Influence | Time to Onset/Influence Notes | |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------| | Hepatoprotective | Protects hepatocytes from toxins (e.g., ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, paracetamol) by stabilizing cell membranes and reducing oxidative damage. Accelerates repair of damaged liver tissue. | Effects on liver enzymes and symptoms (e.g., reduced ALT/AST) visible after 4-12 weeks; preclinical models show acute protection within hours, but clinical onset is 1-3 months. | | Membrane Regeneration and Stabilization | EPL integrates into hepatocyte membranes, restoring integrity and fluidity. Increases membrane phosphatidylcholine content, enhancing permeability and enzymatic activity. | Membrane fluidity increases within 24 hours in vitro; clinical regeneration (e.g., improved histology) after 3 months. | | Antioxidant | Inhibits lipid peroxidation by scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress. DLPC component enhances antioxidant defenses. | Acute in vitro effects within hours; clinical reduction in oxidative markers after 4-8 weeks. | | Anti-inflammatory | Modulates cytokine release and reduces inflammation in liver tissue. Influences membrane-dependent signaling pathways. | Reduction in inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-alpha) after 4-12 weeks in NAFLD studies. | | Antifibrogenic | Inhibits collagen synthesis and fibrosis progression by suppressing stellate cell activation. | Prevents fibrosis in chronic models; clinical slowdown in fibrosis after 3-6 months. | | Anti-apoptotic | Decreases programmed cell death in hepatocytes by stabilizing membranes and reducing caspase activation. | In vitro reduction in apoptosis (e.g., tamoxifen-induced) within 24-48 hours; clinical hepatocyte survival improves over 1-3 months. | | Lipid-Regulating | Reduces fat deposition in the liver (steatosis) and accelerates lipid elimination. Transfers neutral fats and cholesterol to oxidation sites via HDL. | Steatosis regression on imaging (e.g., ultrasound) after 12 weeks; lipid profile improvements (e.g., reduced triglycerides) after 4-8 weeks. | | Detoxification Enhancement | Improves liver's metabolic and detoxification functions by optimizing enzyme activity (e.g., cytochrome P450). | Enhanced detoxification noted after 1-3 months; preclinical models show improved xenobiotic metabolism within days. | | Regenerative | Stimulates hepatocyte proliferation and metabolic activity, aiding liver recovery in conditions like hepatitis. | Liver regeneration acceleration in models within weeks; clinical symptom relief (e.g., appetite improvement) after 1-4 weeks. | | Choleretic (Mild) | Slightly increases bile production and flow, aiding fat digestion. | Minor effect; onset not well-specified, but contributes to overall lipid regulation over weeks. | | Anti-steatotic | Inhibits fatty liver development by normalizing lipid metabolism and reducing insulin resistance. | Steatosis reduction in 53-71% of patients after 3-6 months. | | Membrane Fluidity Modulation | Alters phospholipid composition to increase fluidity, permeability, and receptor function. | In vitro increase in fluidity within hours; sustains over chronic use. | | Apoptosis-Modulating | Reduces apoptosis via membrane protection and signaling modulation. | Similar to anti-apoptotic; in vitro effects rapid (hours), clinical over months. | | Broncholytic (Minor) | Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle; not primary for liver but noted in screening. | Not relevant for liver use; onset acute in models. | | Antilipemic (Minor) | Lowers serum lipids; secondary to liver effects. | Lipid reductions after 4-12 weeks. | These actions collectively improve subjective symptoms (e.g., appetite loss, right hypochondrium pain), biochemical markers (e.g., liver enzymes), imaging (e.g., reduced steatosis), and histology in liver diseases. No toxicity or significant adverse effects reported, ensuring a high efficacy-to-safety ratio. Pharmacokinetics - Absorption: >90% absorbed in the small intestine after oral administration. Most EPL is cleaved by phospholipase A to 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, with ~50% reacylated to polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine during mucosal absorption. - Distribution: Rapidly incorporates into hepatocyte membranes. Peak concentration for choline moiety: 6-24 hours (19.9% of dose). Peak for linoleic acid moiety: 4-12 hours (27.9% of dose). - Metabolism: High bioavailability due to direct membrane integration. No major hepatic metabolism beyond incorporation. - Elimination: Fecal excretion: 2% (choline label), 4.5% (linoleic acid label). Urinary excretion: 6% (choline label), trace (linoleic acid label).

    "content": "Fabomotizole (also known as afobazole; CAS 173352-21-5, noting the user's provided CAS 173352-21-1 appears to be a minor typo) is a selective anxiolytic drug primarily used in Russia for treating anxiety disorders and adjustment disorders. It is not a benzodiazepine and lacks sedative, hypnotic, or muscle relaxant effects at therapeutic doses. Below, I outline its pharmacological actions based on available data, including any quantitative measures (e.g., binding affinities like Ki values, where known) that indicate potency or influence. These values help illustrate the drug's relative strength in interacting with targets—lower Ki values generally mean higher affinity and potentially stronger influence at that site. I've provided as many values as possible from reliable sources, noting that the mechanism is not fully elucidated and some actions are proposed based on preclinical studies. Pharmacological Actions and Associated Values Fabomotizole's effects stem from interactions with multiple targets, leading to anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and neuroprotective outcomes without CNS depression. Key actions include: - Sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) agonism/chaperone activity: Acts as a ligand at sigma-1 receptors, enhancing cellular stress responses, modulating calcium signaling, and providing neuroprotection against ischemia, acidosis, and stress. This is considered a primary mechanism for anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects. - Ki = 5.9 µM (moderate affinity; higher doses needed for significant effect). - IC50 = 6.4–13.7 µM (in mouse brain homogenates, varying by strain; indicates inhibition of ligand binding). - Influence: Prevents stress-induced reductions in GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site binding; reduces neuronal calcium overload in ischemia models at 0.3–3 mg/kg (animal doses). Anxiolytic effects in elevated plus maze tests (e.g., increased open-arm time) at 2.5–5 mg/kg in mice are blocked by sigma-1 antagonists like BD-1047 or NE-100. - Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) reversible inhibition: Inhibits MAO-A, potentially increasing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels, contributing to mood stabilization and anxiolytic effects. - Ki = 3.6 µM (moderate affinity). - Influence: Reversible, unlike irreversible MAOIs; may enhance serotoninergic tone without strong antidepressant effects. Involved in anti-stress responses but less potent than dedicated MAOIs. - Melatonin receptor type 3 (MT3; also NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 or NQO2) antagonism: Antagonizes MT3 receptors, which may modulate oxidative stress and neuroprotection. - Ki = 0.97 µM (high affinity; stronger interaction compared to other targets). - Influence: Contributes to neuroprotective effects; metabolite M-11 (main active metabolite) retains this activity, potentially prolonging some effects. - Melatonin receptor type 1 (MT1) agonism: Agonism at MT1 receptors, possibly influencing sleep-wake cycles and neuroprotection, though affinity is low. - Ki = 160 µM (low affinity; minimal influence at therapeutic doses; some sources report 16 µM, but 160 µM is more consistent across data). - Influence: Suggested role in anxiolytic effects, but weak; may promote nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release. - GABAergic modulation (indirect): Proposed promotion of GABAA receptor function via sigma-1 interactions, without direct binding to benzodiazepine sites. - No direct Ki/IC50 available (not a direct ligand). - Influence: Enhances GABA signaling under stress; prevents ischemia-induced calcium overload in neurons at 10–100 µM in vitro. - NGF and BDNF release promotion: Stimulates release of neurotrophic factors, supporting neuronal survival and plasticity. - No specific quantitative values (preclinical observations). - Influence: Neuroprotective in stroke models; reduces neuronal death in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) at 0.3–3 mg/kg. - Serotonin receptor involvement (unspecified): Potential indirect effects on serotonin systems, possibly via MAO-A inhibition. - No specific Ki/IC50. - Influence: May contribute to anxiolytic mood effects; not well-quantified. - Other neuroprotective actions: Antimutagenic and antiteratogenic in mice; reduces hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin models. - Effective at 10 mg/kg (animal dose) for reducing malondialdehyde accumulation. - Influence: Broad anti-stress effects; restores dopamine in Parkinson's models (e.g., 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum) at deferred doses. These actions collectively produce anxiolytic effects (e.g., reducing anxiety in generalized anxiety disorder) and neuroprotection (e.g., in ischemia or stress models) without sedation. Potency is generally moderate (micromolar Ki values), requiring multi-target engagement for full effects. Clinical efficacy is seen at 30 mg/day, non-inferior to diazepam (30 mg/day) in trials but with better safety. Half-Life - Elimination half-life: 0.82 ± 0.54 hours (short, necessitating multiple daily doses to maintain levels; no accumulation with repeated dosing). Bioavailabilities - Oral bioavailability: 43.64% (moderate, with pronounced first-pass hepatic metabolism reducing systemic exposure). - No data on other routes (e.g., IV, IM) in standard use; the drug is primarily oral. Preclinical studies may use IP or IV, but human bioavailability for non-oral routes is not established. Extensive hepatic metabolism (via CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) yields inactive metabolites, with renal excretion (~70% as metabolites). Dosages Fabomotizole is typically administered orally in tablets. Doses are based on clinical trials and Russian guidelines (not FDA-evaluated). - Minimum effective dose: 10 mg/day (divided; e.g., 5–10 mg 1–2 times daily), sufficient for mild anxiety in some patients. - Standard/therapeutic range (safe range): 10–30 mg/day, divided into 2–3 doses (e.g., 10 mg three times daily). Used for 2–4 weeks, extendable to 12 weeks under supervision. - Maximum dose without high risks: Up to 60 mg/day (divided; e.g., 20 mg three times daily) in severe cases, per some clinical practices, with monitoring. Exceeding this increases side effect risk without proportional benefit. - LD50 (lethal dose 50%): Not publicly available for humans (rare overdose reports; low toxicity profile). In animal studies (mice/rats), LD50 >1,000 mg/kg (oral/IP), indicating very low acute toxicity. No fatal human overdoses reported; drug has a wide therapeutic index. - When it starts to become too dangerous (estimation): Doses >60–100 mg/day may increase risks of mild-to-moderate side effects (e.g., nausea, headache, dizziness). Overdose symptoms (rare, even at high doses) include drowsiness, GI upset, or allergic reactions; severe toxicity unlikely without co-ingestants. At >200–500 mg (estimation based on animal scaling), potential for pronounced CNS effects or organ strain, but no data on lethal thresholds in humans. Seek medical help for any suspected overdose; supportive care is sufficient due to short half-life. Side effects are mild/rare (e.g., nausea, headache, dizziness, allergic rash; <5% incidence) and resolve quickly. No withdrawal, dependence, or abuse potential. Well-tolerated in trials vs. diazepam. For closed-ended math (e.g., half-life calculations), no specific equations are needed here, but half-life (t1/2 = 0.82 h) means plasma levels halve every ~0.82 hours: after 1 dose, ~50% remains at 0.82 h; ~25% at 1.64 h. Steady-state with TID dosing maintains therapeutic levels."

    "title": "Flupirtine Maleate",
    "url": "actions.html?md=flupirtine_maleate",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Flupirtine Maleate Flupirtine maleate is a centrally acting non-opioid analgesic with a unique profile. Its primary actions stem from its mechanism as a selective neuronal potassium channel opener (SNEPCO), particularly targeting Kv7 (KCNQ) voltage-gated potassium channels. This leads to neuronal membrane hyperpolarization, reducing excitability and pain signaling. It also has indirect NMDA receptor antagonistic effects (without direct binding) and GABAA receptor modulatory properties, contributing to its effects. Additional actions include antioxidant properties and influences on other channels like GIRK (G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels). Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions, based on available data from clinical and preclinical studies. | Pharmacological Action | Description and Influence | Quantitative Values (Where Available) | |------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------| | Analgesic (Pain Relief) | Provides relief for acute and chronic pain by stabilizing neuronal membranes, inhibiting nociceptive impulse transmission, and reducing NMDA-mediated calcium influx. Effective for musculoskeletal pain, headaches, postoperative pain, oncology-related pain, dysmenorrhea, and neuropathic pain. Influences by decreasing neuronal hyperexcitability without opioid-like dependence. | - Therapeutic plasma concentration: 1–10 μM (general); 2–6 μM for Kv7 activation.<br>- Effective dose range in studies: 200–600 mg/day reduces pain scores by >95% in post-marketing surveillance (n=7,806 patients).<br>- Discriminative effects mediated via alpha-2 adrenergic mechanisms (not opioid or alpha-1).<br>- NMDA inhibition: Dose-dependent reduction in glutamate-induced Ca++ rise (no specific IC50 reported).<br>- Analgesic potency: Comparable to pentazocine, dihydrocodeine, paracetamol, or ibuprofen; less than morphine or buprenorphine.<br>- In low-back pain: 300 mg/day equivalent to tramadol 150 mg/day (randomized double-blind study). | | Muscle Relaxant (Skeletal and Smooth Muscle) | Reduces muscle tension and spasticity by hyperpolarizing motor neurons and inhibiting polysynaptic reflexes (e.g., flexor reflex). Influences conditions like chronic musculoskeletal pain or spasticity without affecting monosynaptic reflexes (e.g., H-reflex). | - Effective in same dose as analgesia (100–400 mg/day).<br>- Reduces polysynaptic flexor reflex by 2 hours post-200 mg dose (healthy subjects).<br>- No quantitative potency values like EC50; acts via Kv7 and GIRK channels.<br>- In cancer-related neuropathic pain: Combined with opioids, reduces pain and improves quality of life (case series, n=10). | | Neuroprotective | Protects neurons from damage by upregulating Bcl-2, increasing glutathione levels, delaying mitochondrial calcium loss, and acting as an antioxidant. Influences by preventing excitotoxicity and oxidative stress in models of energy deprivation or neurotoxic exposure. Potential in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., improved cognition in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). | - Effective concentration: 2–6 μM (in vitro Kv7 enhancement).<br>- Bcl-2 upregulation and glutathione increase: Observed in preclinical models.<br>- Antioxidant effect: 10–100 times higher than therapeutic range (1–10 μM) in some studies.<br>- No abuse potential in most cases, but tolerance reported individually. | | Anticonvulsant (Potential) | Inhibits sustained neuronal action potential firing and hyperexcitability, potentially useful in seizures. Influences by enhancing Kv7/M-channel activity and GABAA potentiation. | - Effective in preclinical models; human therapeutic range: 1–10 μM.<br>- Kv7 activation: Inhibits action potential firing (no specific EC50).<br>- Potentiates GABAA receptors (additive to Kv7 effects). | | Smooth Muscle Relaxant | Relaxes smooth muscles, potentially aiding in dysmenorrhea or other visceral pain. Influences via similar channel-opening mechanisms. | - Limited quantitative data; overlaps with skeletal relaxant effects at 100–600 mg/day. | These actions are interconnected, with the primary influence being neuronal stabilization via potassium efflux and reduced calcium influx, leading to decreased excitability without opioid risks or NSAID gastrointestinal effects. No addictive properties in most studies, but rare abuse cases noted. Hepatotoxicity is a key risk, restricting long-term use. Half-Life The elimination half-life varies by route, population, and formulation: - Average: 6.5 hours (oral administration in healthy adults). - Intravenous: 1.8–8.5 hours. - Rectal: 10.7 hours. - Elderly: 11.2–16.8 hours (average 14 hours). - Moderate renal impairment: 8.7–10.9 hours (average 9.8 hours). - Oral (immediate-release): ~9.6 hours. - After repeated dosing: Steady-state reached in 2 days, no accumulation observed over 28 days (100 mg 3x daily). Bioavailabilities Flupirtine is rapidly absorbed but bioavailability varies: - Oral: 90% (complete absorption from GI tract; reaches peak in 1.6–2 hours). - Rectal: 70% (peak at 5.7 hours). - Immediate-release capsules: ~72%. - Modified-release: ~60% (lower due to formulation). - Absolute bioavailability (vs. IV): 100% for oral, 72.5% for rectal. - No data on other routes like IV bioavailability (assumed 100%). Dosages Dosages are tailored for pain relief, with restrictions due to hepatotoxicity (limited to acute pain ≤2 weeks; monitor liver enzymes; avoid in liver disease or if other analgesics are viable). Start at lowest effective dose. | Category | Recommended Dosage | Details | |----------|--------------------|---------| | Adult Oral | 100–400 mg/day (divided into 3–4 doses; max 600 mg/day). | - Standard: 100 mg capsule 3–4 times daily.<br>- For moderate-severe acute pain: 300–400 mg/day.<br>- In studies: 200–600 mg/day (e.g., 100 mg 4x daily common in fibromyalgia trials).<br>- Immediate-release: 50–100 mg capsules.<br>- Modified-release: Adjusted for lower bioavailability. | | Adult Rectal | 450–600 mg/day (suppositories). | - 150 mg suppository 3–4 times daily. | | Children | 150–200 mg/day (oral) or 150–250 mg/day (rectal), divided into 3–4 doses. | - For ages where approved; lower in mild renal impairment or elderly. | | Minimum Effective Dose | 100 mg single dose (oral). | - Achieves pain relief in acute settings; plasma Cmax ~0.8–2.0 mg/L at 1.6–2 hours.<br>- For chronic: Start at 100–200 mg/day. | | Safe Range | 100–600 mg/day (adults); do not exceed 600 mg/day. | - Initiate at lowest dose for efficacy (e.g., 100 mg).<br>- Elderly/renal impairment: Use lowest dose; monitor transaminases.<br>- Duration: ≤2 weeks (per 2013 restrictions); withdrawn in some markets (e.g., EU 2018) due to liver injury risks.<br>- No tolerance in most (up to 1 year), but individual cases reported.<br>- Overdose risk: Hepatotoxicity; no psychological/motor impairment at therapeutic doses. | For veterinary (e.g., horses): 1 mg/kg IV or 5 mg/kg oral (bioavailability 71.4%), but not relevant to human use."

    "title": "Furosemide",
    "url": "actions.html?md=furosemide",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Furosemide Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic primarily used for treating edema, hypertension, and conditions like heart failure or renal disease. Its main mechanism is inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water. It also affects proximal and distal tubules. Below is a comprehensive list of its pharmacological actions, based on data from sources like DrugBank, StatPearls, and FDA labels. For each, I've included available time course data (onset, peak, and duration) where applicable, focusing on diuretic and related effects. These can vary by route of administration, patient factors (e.g., renal impairment), and dose. Times are averages for standard adult doses (e.g., 20-80 mg oral or IV). - Diuretic Effect (Primary Action: Increased Urinary Excretion of Water, Sodium, Chloride, Potassium): Inhibits electrolyte reabsorption, promoting natriuresis and diuresis. This reduces extracellular fluid volume. - Oral: Onset 30-60 minutes, peak 1-2 hours, duration 6-8 hours. - IV: Onset 5 minutes, peak 20-60 minutes, duration 2 hours. - IM: Onset 10-30 minutes, peak unknown (likely 1-2 hours), duration 4-8 hours. - SUBQ: Onset unknown (likely within 1 hour), peak unknown (median 4-5 hours based on bioavailability studies), duration 8 hours. - Influence: Leads to rapid fluid loss (up to 1-2 liters in responsive patients), but can cause dehydration if excessive. In renal impairment, duration prolongs (up to 24 hours total effect). - Electrolyte Imbalance Induction (Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, Hypomagnesemia, Hypocalcemia): Increases excretion of potassium, magnesium, and calcium; can cause hyponatremia via water loss. - Time Course: Mirrors diuretic effect (peaks within 1-2 hours post-dose), but cumulative with repeated dosing; effects like hypokalemia may manifest over days/weeks. - Influence: Risk of arrhythmias (e.g., due to low potassium/magnesium), muscle cramps, or metabolic alkalosis (from chloride loss and hydrogen ion shifts). - Venodilation and Preload Reduction: Direct vasodilatory effect on veins, reducing venous return to the heart (beneficial in acute pulmonary edema). - IV: Onset within 5-15 minutes (faster than diuretic effect), peak 30 minutes, duration 2-4 hours. - Influence: Rapid relief of dyspnea in heart failure; lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure before significant diuresis occurs. - Antihypertensive Effect: Reduces blood pressure via volume depletion and possible direct vascular effects. - Oral: Onset 1-2 hours, peak 4-6 hours, duration 6-8 hours per dose; full effect may take days with chronic use. - Influence: Lowers systolic/diastolic pressure by 10-20 mmHg in responsive patients; more pronounced in hypertension with edema. - Increased Uric Acid Retention (Hyperuricemia): Competes with uric acid for renal secretion, potentially precipitating gout. - Time Course: Acute rise within hours of dose, peaks 4-6 hours; chronic elevation with repeated use. - Influence: Can exacerbate gout attacks; risk increases with doses >80 mg/day. - Metabolic Effects (e.g., Hyperglycemia, Metabolic Alkalosis): Mild glucose elevation due to hypokalemia; alkalosis from bicarbonate retention. - Time Course: Onset 1-2 hours, peaks with diuretic effect; resolves as drug clears. - Influence: Worsens diabetes control; alkalosis can cause fatigue or confusion. - Ototoxicity (Hearing Loss, Tinnitus): High doses inhibit NKCC1 in the inner ear, causing reversible or permanent damage. - IV (rapid infusion): Onset minutes to hours, peak during infusion, duration variable (often transient, but permanent at >200 mg rapid IV). - Influence: Dose-related; higher risk in renal failure or with aminoglycosides. - Other Minor Actions: Noncompetitive blockade of GABA-A receptors (at high concentrations, potential CNS effects like sedation); increased renal blood flow initially. - Time Course: Not well-defined for these; generally aligns with peak plasma levels (1-2 hours oral, 30 minutes IV). - Influence: Rare clinical relevance except in overdose. Note: In renal or hepatic impairment, all effects prolong due to extended half-life. Maximum diuresis/electrolyte loss is greater than with thiazides but similar to other loop diuretics. Half-Life - Normal renal function: 0.5-2 hours (average 1-1.5 hours). - Renal impairment: Prolonged, up to 9-24 hours in severe cases (e.g., end-stage renal disease). - Hepatic impairment: Doubled (e.g., up to 4-10 hours in cirrhosis). - Neonates/Infants: 1.2-67 hours (highly variable, longer in prematures). - Elderly: Slightly prolonged (e.g., 2-3 hours). Bioavailabilities by Route Bioavailability varies widely due to absorption-limited kinetics and patient factors (e.g., gut edema in heart failure reduces it). - Oral (tablets/solution): 10-100%, average 47-70% (commonly ~50-64%; higher with food, lower in uremia or severe edema). - IV: 100%. - IM: ~100% (similar to IV, but slightly delayed absorption). - SUBQ: 99-112% (nearly complete, based on formulations like Furoscix). - Sublingual: ~59% (slightly higher than oral, but similar kinetics). Dosages Dosages are individualized based on response, condition, and renal function. Titrate to the minimum effective dose to minimize risks like electrolyte loss. Below are guidelines from sources like Drugs.com, Medscape, and FDA labels. All for adults unless noted; pediatrics: 1-2 mg/kg (max 6 mg/kg/day). - Safe Range (General): 20-600 mg/day oral/IV, divided doses. Start low (20-40 mg), increase gradually. Monitor electrolytes, weight, and renal function daily initially. - Minimum Effective Dose: Varies; e.g., 20 mg oral for mild edema/hypertension; 40 mg IV for acute pulmonary edema. In responsive patients, 5-10 mg may suffice initially. - Maximum Without High Risks: Up to 600 mg/day in severe/refractory cases (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, severe heart failure), but only under close monitoring. Individual doses: Max 200 mg IV per dose. Risks (dehydration, ototoxicity) rise >80-160 mg/day or with rapid IV infusion. - LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%): No human data (ethical reasons). Animal data: Oral rat 2600 mg/kg; IP rat 800 mg/kg; SC rat 4600 mg/kg. Human lowest published toxic dose (TDLo): 6.25 mg/kg (female, oral). Overdose threshold not fixed, but symptoms (severe hypotension, shock, renal failure) can start at 200-500 mg in sensitive patients. - When It Becomes Too Dangerous: No exact threshold, but risks escalate at >200 mg single IV dose (ototoxicity) or >600 mg/day chronic (electrolyte imbalances, gout, renal damage). Dangerous in renal failure (prolonged effects), dehydration, or with ototoxic drugs. Overdose: Dehydration/electrolyte loss leads to shock; treat supportively (fluids, electrolytes). Signs of danger: Urine output >1 mL/kg/h unresponsive, severe hypokalemia (<3 mEq/L), or hypotension. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized dosing, as furosemide can interact with many drugs (e.g., NSAIDs reduce efficacy, digoxin increases arrhythmia risk with hypokalemia)."

    "content": "GENFERON® suppositories, containing Interferon alfa-2b, Benzocaine, and Taurine, are designed for both local and systemic immunomodulatory, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. The interferon component is absorbed through the mucous membranes into surrounding tissues and the lymphatic system, allowing it to exert effects beyond the site of administration. However, the extent of systemic action (i.e., affecting the whole body) depends on the route: - Rectal administration: Provides high bioavailability (over 80%), leading to pronounced systemic immunomodulatory effects alongside local action. - Vaginal administration: Primarily achieves strong local effects at the infection site, with minimal systemic absorption due to the vaginal mucosa's low uptake capacity. Benzocaine acts as a local anesthetic, reducing permeability of cell membranes and blocking nerve impulses mainly at the insertion site, while Taurine supports anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects locally. Peak serum interferon levels occur about 5 hours after use, but decline within 12 hours, often requiring repeated dosing for sustained effects. Overall, while not exclusively systemic, the drug does impact the entire body, particularly via rectal use in treatments like urogenital infections or viral conditions."

    "url": "actions.html?md=genferon-2",
    "content": "For rectal administration of GENFERON® suppositories, the interferon alfa-2b component exhibits high bioavailability, exceeding 80%, which allows it to be absorbed into the systemic circulation and exert pronounced immunomodulatory effects throughout the body. This means over 80% of the interferon dose reaches the bloodstream unchanged, contributing to whole-body antiviral and immune responses, in addition to local effects at the administration site. Peak serum concentrations are typically achieved around 5 hours post-administration, with an elimination half-life of about 12 hours, supporting twice-daily dosing for sustained systemic activity. Benzocaine primarily provides local anesthetic effects with minimal systemic absorption, while taurine aids in local anti-inflammatory and regenerative actions, so the overall \"whole-body\" impact is driven predominantly by the interferon's >80% systemic bioavailability."

    "title": "Gepatamin",
    "url": "actions.html?md=gepatamin",
    "content": "Here’s what can be said about Gepatamin based on currently available scientific and product-label information — with a clear emphasis on limitations, because Gepatamin is not an approved pharmaceutical drug with well-characterized pharmacological parameters in the medical literature. Instead, it’s marketed in many places (especially Russia/Eastern Europe) as a dietary supplement / liver “bioregulator” / hepatoprotective peptide complex. There are no authoritative peer–reviewed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, toxicology, LD₅₀, or dose-response data in standard scientific databases. ([Цитамины][1]) --- 🧪 What Gepatamin Is Gepatamin is sold as a complex of proteins / peptides and nucleoproteins derived from bovine liver, with claims of selective activity on liver hepatocytes — purportedly supporting regeneration and metabolic normalization of the liver. It’s often described as hepatoprotective and bioregulatory rather than a defined drug with specific receptors or molecular mechanisms. ([Цитамины][1]) 👉 Important: This product is generally classified as a dietary supplement (“БАД”) rather than an approved medicine in many markets, meaning it is not regulated to the same pharmacological standards as licensed drugs. ([Цитамины][1]) --- ⚙️ Claimed Pharmacological Actions The described actions are not well studied in controlled clinical pharmacology and come from product information rather than rigorous trials: Hepatoprotective / bioregulatory for hepatocytes — claimed to accelerate repair and restore function. ([Цитамины][1]) Normalization of hepatocyte metabolism and enzymatic activity. ([gorzdrav.org][2]) Stabilization of liver biochemical markers like bilirubin and liver enzymes (reported in unofficial sources). ([Цитамины][1]) > Note: These effects are claimed by sellers and not confirmed by high-quality independent pharmacology studies. There is no established receptor target, enzyme mechanism, or validated animal/human pharmacodynamic model published in peer-reviewed journals. --- 🧬 Pharmacokinetics: Essentially Unknown There is no published pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) in recognized scientific databases such as PubMed or DrugBank for Gepatamin: Bioavailability (oral or other routes): Not established in medical literature. Half-life (t½): Not known. Peak concentration (Tmax): No data available. Distribution / Vd: No data available. Metabolism pathways: Not characterized. Elimination routes: Not characterized. Because Gepatamin is a peptide/protein complex that presumably breaks down into amino acids, traditional small-molecule PK parameters are not reliably defined. --- 💊 Dosage Information (Claimed, Not Scientifically Verified) Available product information gives recommendations used by manufacturers, not evidence-based therapeutic dosing: Typical suggested dosage: ~1–3 tablets, 2–3 times per day, taken 10–15 minutes before meals for 10–15 days, with possible repeat courses after months. ([Цитамины][1]) Even this recommendation is not from clinical pharmacology studies and should not be taken as a medically validated dose range. --- 🚨 Toxicity, Safety, LD₅₀, Therapeutic Indices There is no authoritative toxicology or LD₅₀ data for Gepatamin in humans or animals found in scientific literature. Because it is a complex mixture of peptides derived from animal tissue, an LD₅₀ (lethal dose 50%) measurement analogous to a defined chemical or drug is not established. Manufacturers claim that the product: Does not accumulate in the body. ([Цитамины][1]) Does not cause withdrawal or classical side effects. ([Цитамины][1]) But again, these are unverified claims on product marketing pages, not clinical safety data. ⚠️ “Too dangerous” thresholds are unknown because there is no rigorous safety evaluation or overdose data available. --- 📌 Scientific Caveats Because Gepatamin is marketed as a dietary supplement/bioregulator, it lacks the following: ✔ Peer-reviewed pharmacodynamic (mechanism) characterization. ✔ Standard pharmacokinetic studies (bioavailability, half-life, Tmax, clearance). ✔ Formal toxicology or LD₅₀ studies. ✔ Regulatory approval by major agencies (FDA/EMA) as a drug. Therefore, the data you’re asking for (exact pharmacological effects, half-life, bioavailability, LD₅₀, toxic thresholds) do not exist in the scientific record for this compound. The available information comes from product descriptions rather than controlled research. --- 🧠 Summary | Parameter | Known / Established | Notes | | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | | Pharmacological Actions | Claimed hepatoprotective/bioregulatory | No validated mechanisms | | Bioavailability | Unknown | No human PK data | | Half-Life | Unknown | Not studied | | Tmax / Cmax | Unknown | Not studied | | Metabolism | Unknown | Likely peptide digestion | | Excretion | Unknown | Not studied | | Therapeutic Dose Range | Product-suggested dosing | Not clinically verified | | LD₅₀ / Toxicity Threshold | Unknown | No toxicology data | --- 🧾 What You Should Know If You’re Considering Use Consult a medical professional before using this product, especially if you have liver disease or take other medications. Because there’s no clinical pharmacology backing, efficacy and safety are not established. Regulatory status and quality control can vary by region and manufacturer. --- If you want, I can help explain how drugs that do have well-characterized liver protective effects (like ursodeoxycholic acid or N-acetylcysteine) work in comparison, with proper pharmacokinetic data.

    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Glycine Glycine is a non-essential amino acid with several key pharmacological actions, primarily in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. It acts as both an inhibitory neurotransmitter and an excitatory co-agonist, depending on the receptor. - Inhibitory Neurotransmission (via Strychnine-Sensitive Glycine Receptors - GlyRs): Glycine binds to ligand-gated chloride channels (GlyRs) in the spinal cord, brainstem, and other CNS areas, increasing Cl⁻ influx, hyperpolarizing neurons, and reducing excitability. This mediates fast inhibitory signaling, regulating motor control, sensory processing (e.g., pain, hearing), and reflex arcs. - Excitatory Co-Agonism at NMDA Receptors: Glycine binds to the strychnine-insensitive site on NMDA receptors (obligatory co-agonist with glutamate), facilitating receptor activation, Ca²⁺ influx, and enhanced excitatory neurotransmission. This is prominent in the forebrain and supports synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. - Antispastic Effects: Enhances spinal inhibitory transmission via GlyRs, potentially reducing muscle spasticity. - Antipsychotic Potential: Potentiates NMDA function, which may improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia (adjunctive therapy). - Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Attenuates neutrophil oxidant production and protects against oxidative stress, hypoxia-reperfusion injury, and inflammation (e.g., in liver or endotoxin models). - Other Effects: Hepatic detoxification (conjugation with toxins for excretion), potential metabolic benefits (e.g., insulin secretion modulation via NMDA in periphery), and indirect roles in sleep improvement or neuroprotection. Pharmacokinetic Parameters - Absorption: Rapidly absorbed from the small intestine via active transport (Na⁺/Cl⁻-dependent transporters). Oral administration shows peak plasma levels ~30 minutes post-ingestion. - Bioavailability: High for oral route (near-complete absorption as an amino acid; studies show significant plasma increases, e.g., ~54% above baseline at 3 g dose). No exact percentage reported in most sources, but considered excellent. - Half-Life (Plasma): Dose-dependent, ranging from 0.43–4.08 hours (26–245 minutes). Increases proportionally with dose (e.g., shorter at low doses, longer at high doses due to saturation of metabolism). - Metabolism: Primarily hepatic; degraded via glycine cleavage system or converted to serine/pyruvate. - Elimination: Renal (as metabolites) and hepatic. - Other: Plasma returns to baseline ~3 hours after oral dosing in studies. Dosage Information Dosages vary by indication and are generally oral (supplements or capsules). Glycine is well-tolerated, but high doses (>15 g/day) may cause mild GI upset (nausea, diarrhea). - General Supplementation/Sleep Improvement: 3–5 g/day (often 3 g before bed for sleep effects). Minimum effective: ~3 g. - Schizophrenia (Adjunctive): 30–60 g/day (or 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day). Minimum effective: Often ~30 g/day in trials. - Antispastic or Other Therapeutic: 2–60 g/day in clinical studies. - Safe Range: Up to 6 g/day well-tolerated for weeks; studies show 90 g/day tolerated short-term. Doses of 1 g/day are very safe; avoid exceeding 60 g/day chronically without monitoring. - Other Routes: IV (in parenteral nutrition or studies), irrigation (surgical). No standard oral bioavailability differences vs. other routes noted. These values are from clinical studies and reviews; individual responses vary. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized use, especially at high doses."

    "content": "Glycine (aminoacetic acid) is a non-essential amino acid that serves endogenous roles but exhibits pharmacological effects primarily when supplemented (orally, IV, or otherwise), acting via specific receptors and metabolic pathways. Key Pharmacological Actions and Associated Time Parameters Glycine’s actions stem from: - Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyRs): Ligand-gated Cl⁻ channels (α1–α4 + β subunits), causing hyperpolarization/inhibition (CNS: spinal cord/brainstem/retina for motor/sensory/pain/reflex control; immune cells for anti-inflammatory effects). Effective channel opening ~1–3 mM (far above normal plasma ~200–300 µM). - Strychnine-insensitive glycine site on NMDA receptors: Co-agonist with glutamate, enhancing excitatory signaling (supports NMDA hypofunction hypothesis in schizophrenia negative symptoms/cognition). - Other: GPRC6A (GPCR), transporters; precursor for glutathione (antioxidant), creatine; one-carbon metabolism; cytoprotection (e.g., blocks plasma membrane pores, attenuates neutrophils/ROS in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), endotoxemia, liver injury). Specific actions with time values (where data exist; many are plasma PK-driven or chronic; synaptic effects are fast but supplemental systemic effects lag absorption/brain entry): 1. Inhibitory neurotransmission/antispastic (GlyR-mediated): - Synaptic: Milliseconds–seconds (IPSP via Cl⁻ influx). - Supplemental (antispastic/antinociceptive potential): Plasma peak ~30 min post-oral (1 g dose → +54% plasma glycine); effects duration aligns with elevated levels (~3 h return to baseline for low doses). Higher doses prolong via intracellular accumulation. 2. NMDA co-agonism/antipsychotic (negative symptoms in schizophrenia, cognition): - Acute brain/CSF increase: Oral/IV raises levels; plasma Tmax ~0.5–4 h (formulation-dependent), brain entry documented. - Clinical effects: Onset over weeks (6–8 weeks in trials at 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day); no acute single-dose data for symptoms. Improves negative symptoms (e.g., ~30% reduction in PANSS negative subscale in some trials), cognition/alertness in some studies. - Duration: Requires chronic dosing; effects wane post-discontinuation. 3. Anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory: - GlyR-dependent (immune cells: macrophages, Kupffer, neutrophils, T-cells): Hyperpolarization → ↓Ca²⁺ influx → ↓TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, superoxide; ↑IL-10; NF-κB inhibition (partly NRF2-mediated). Effective at 1–3 mM. - Acute experimental (e.g., LPS/endotoxemia, sepsis, IRI models): Rapid (minutes–hours) attenuation of cytokine surge, neutrophil infiltration, organ damage. - Chronic supp. (e.g., 0.1 g/kg/day ×14 days or 5 g/day): ↓pro-inflammatory cytokines/adipokines, improved insulin response; dietary 0.5% in models prevents infiltration. 4. Antioxidant/cytoprotective (glutathione precursor, IRI protection): - GSH synthesis support: Ongoing with availability; supp. counters age/oxidative stress decline. - IRI/endotoxemia protection: Acute IV/oral (pre-/peri-ischemia) inhibits pore formation, ↓ROS/neutrophils; survival benefits in shock models within hours–days. 5. Sleep-promoting: - Lowers core temperature, shortens NREM latency, stabilizes sleep (possibly via NMDA in suprachiasmatic nucleus or GlyR). - Onset: 3 g oral ~30–60 min pre-bed; subjective improvements next day (↓fatigue, ↑alertness/cognition); polysomnography shows latency reduction in first sleep cycle. NREM increase in first ~90 min post-administration in some models. - Duration: Overnight effects; daytime benefits post-single dose. Limited precise onset/duration per action due to reliance on plasma PK (rapid absorption/peak, short half-life) and chronic use in clinical contexts. Brain effects confirmed but BBB penetration may be rate-limiting at low doses. Pharmacokinetics - Half-life (apparent/elimination): Dose-dependent, 26–245 min (0.43–4.08 h); proportional to dose (e.g., low doses shorter, high doses longer due to intracellular accumulation/saturation). From IV/oral studies (10–91 g). - Absorption/Bioavailability: - Oral: Rapid active transport (small intestine); high bioavailability (~60–90% estimates; predicted ~100% in models; \"exceptional\" in supplement PK). Plasma peak ~30 min (1 g dose), return to baseline ~3 h (low dose). Increases plasma/CSF/brain glycine. - IV: 100% (reference); used in some IRI/TPN contexts. - Tmax: ~0.5–1 h (solution) or longer (tablets); food may delay/increase exposure in some formulations. - Distribution: Wide (including CNS); Vd not well quantified. - Metabolism/Excretion: Hepatic (various enzymes/pathways: GSH, creatine, one-carbon, etc.); renal component. Dosages, Safe Range, Minimum Effective - Typical dietary: ~2–3 g/day. - General supplemental (sleep, cognition, anti-inflam support): 3–5 g/day oral (safe/tolerated); minimum effective for sleep ~3 g pre-bed. - Schizophrenia (adjunct, negative symptoms; with non-clozapine antipsychotics): 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day (~25–60 g/day for average adult, divided 3x; titrate from ~4 g/day). Effects in 6–8 weeks. Minimum effective: Lower doses (e.g., 10–30 g) tried with mixed results; high doses more consistent in responsive patients. Avoid with clozapine (may worsen symptoms). - Safe range: 1 g/day very well-tolerated; up to 6 g/day ×4 weeks possibly safe; higher (up to 90 g studied) tolerated short-term but nausea/GI risk increases. Long-term high-dose safety limited (potential neurotoxicity concerns unconfirmed). LD50 high (grams/kg in animals). - Other: Stroke (acute, limited data); TPN/irrigation (specific formulations). Always under supervision for high doses. Evidence is strongest for sleep (low-dose) and schizophrenia adjunct (high-dose, mixed replication); many other actions are preclinical/promising but not standard therapy. Consult a healthcare provider, especially with medications (e.g., interacts with clozapine) or conditions. High doses require monitoring."

    "title": "Homemade Immunovir",
    "url": "actions.html?md=homemade_immunovir",
    "content": "Homemade \"Immunovir\" is a concept based on an attempt to recreate the effects of Inosine pranobex, a compound that was originally marketed under the brand name Immunovir. Inosine pranobex has been used in some countries as an immune-stimulating drug, often for the treatment of viral infections and immune-related conditions, though its effectiveness and availability vary worldwide. Key Components: Inosine and DMAE The core idea of homemade \"Immunovir\" typically involves combining inosine and DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), two components that, while they have some related properties, do not fully replicate the activity of the original drug. 1. Inosine: This is a nucleoside that the body can convert into various substances important for cell function. It has been used as a supplement for athletic performance and brain function, with some immune-enhancing properties. 2. DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol): DMAE is a compound sometimes used as a nootropic (cognitive enhancer). It is naturally found in small amounts in the human brain and in some foods, and is believed to promote acetylcholine production, benefiting mood and cognitive functions. Its effects on the immune system are, however, indirect and limited. Mechanism of Action of Real Inosine Pranobex Inosine pranobex is an immunomodulator that is thought to work by: Enhancing lymphocyte activity, particularly T-lymphocytes. Increasing the production of cytokines like interferon-gamma and interleukins, which help combat viruses. Potentially increasing antibody production. Inosine pranobex combines inosine with another component, N,N-dimethylamino-2-propanol p-acetamidobenzoate, which isn’t the same as DMAE and plays a specific role in its immune-stimulating properties. Challenges with Homemade \"Immunovir\" Combining inosine and DMAE does not replicate the mechanism of Inosine pranobex: Limited Immunomodulatory Effects: While inosine may support cellular energy and metabolic processes, it does not by itself provide the same immune cell activation or cytokine production as the original drug. DMAE's Role: DMAE does not have a clear effect on immune function, and its impact on brain health or mood may vary significantly from person to person. Potential Risks Dosage and Side Effects: Dosage can be hard to standardize without professional oversight. Inosine, for example, has been associated with increased uric acid levels, potentially leading to gout or kidney stones if used in high amounts or over long periods. Ineffectiveness: Because inosine and DMAE do not fully mimic the effects of Inosine pranobex, the resulting mixture may not provide the desired immune benefits, and it lacks clinical backing for immune support. Summary Homemade \"Immunovir\" using inosine and DMAE may not effectively stimulate the immune system and does not fully replicate the properties of Inosine pranobex. If immune support is needed, it’s generally safer and more effective to consult a healthcare provider to discuss clinically validated supplements or medications rather than relying on untested homemade formulations."

    "title": "Hyaluronidase",
    "url": "actions.html?md=hyaluronidase",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Hyaluronidase (LYDASE) Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that primarily catalyzes the hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid (HA), a glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. LYDASE is a specific formulation of hyaluronidase derived from bovine (cattle) testes, typically available in strengths like 64 IU/mL or 1280 IU per ampoule. It acts as a \"spreading factor\" by depolymerizing HA, reducing its viscosity, and increasing tissue permeability. This facilitates fluid movement, drug dispersion, and resolution of tissue abnormalities. The enzyme cleaves β-1,4 glycosidic bonds between glucosamine and glucuronic acid in HA, leading to temporary microchannels in tissues. Below is a comprehensive list of pharmacological actions, based on available data from clinical and pharmacological sources. For each action, I've included time-related values (e.g., onset, duration, and how it influences the action). Onset is generally immediate upon subcutaneous (SC) injection, with peak effects within minutes to hours. Duration of action is 24-48 hours due to the enzyme's high potency, despite a short half-life (2-3 minutes in plasma; <30 minutes in subcutaneous tissue). These times can vary by dose, route, and patient factors. Influences are described qualitatively, with quantitative impacts where data exists (e.g., extent of permeability increase or HA degradation). | Pharmacological Action | Description and Influence | Time Values | |------------------------|---------------------------|-------------| | Depolymerization of Hyaluronic Acid | Breaks down HA into monosaccharides (glucosamine and glucuronic acid), reducing extracellular matrix viscosity by up to 50-90% temporarily. This creates microchannels, allowing better fluid flow and tissue remodeling. Influences: Reduces tissue resistance, aiding in scar softening and edema resolution. | Onset: Immediate (within 1-2 minutes of injection). Peak: 10-30 minutes. Duration: 24-48 hours (HA half-life is 15-20 hours naturally; enzyme extends degradation). Full tissue restoration: 48 hours. | | Increase in Tissue Permeability | Enhances permeability of connective tissues and blood vessels by hydrolyzing acid mucopolysaccharides. Influences: Improves diffusion of fluids/drugs by 2-5 times the rate without hyaluronidase, reducing interstitial pressure and facilitating absorption. | Onset: Immediate. Peak: 5-15 minutes. Duration: 24-48 hours. Rate of diffusion proportional to dose (e.g., 150 IU increases spread by 3-4x in animal models). | | Facilitation of Drug/Fluid Absorption and Dispersion | Acts as an adjuvant to spread injected substances (e.g., local anesthetics, contrast agents). Influences: Increases bioavailability of co-administered drugs by 20-50%, hastens onset of analgesia (e.g., reduces swelling and enhances anesthetic spread). | Onset: Immediate. Peak: 10-20 minutes. Duration: 24-48 hours. For example, with local anesthetics, onset hastened by 5-10 minutes, but systemic absorption may shorten duration by 20-30%. | | Reduction of Tissue Swelling (Edema) | Decreases viscosity of interstitial fluids, promoting resorption of exudates/transudates. Influences: Reduces edema volume by 30-60% in hypodermoclysis or extravasation cases. | Onset: 5-15 minutes. Peak: 30-60 minutes. Duration: Up to 48 hours. Reported in <0.1% of cases as a side effect, but therapeutic in edema management. | | Scar Softening and Flattening | Softens hypertrophic/keloid scars by breaking down HA in scar tissue. Influences: Reduces scar hardness by 20-40%, improves elasticity, and prevents contracture formation. Specific to LYDASE: Used for burn scars, ulcers, and post-surgical adhesions. | Onset: 24-48 hours per injection. Peak: After 10-20 injections (cumulative). Duration: Effects last weeks to months with repeated dosing; single dose: 24-48 hours. | | Improvement in Joint Mobility | Increases range of motion in stiff joints (e.g., contractures, Dupuytren's). Influences: Enhances synovial fluid movement, reducing stiffness by 15-30% in affected joints. | Onset: 1-2 hours. Peak: 24 hours. Duration: 24-48 hours per dose; repeated for chronic conditions. | | Reversal of HA-Based Fillers | Degrades cosmetic HA fillers (off-label). Influences: Dissolves fillers by 50-90% depending on dose; reverses vascular occlusion or overfilling. | Onset: Immediate (softening in minutes). Peak: 24-48 hours. Duration: Effects continue up to 48 hours; full reversal may require multiple doses. | | Promotion of Hematoma/Extravasation Resolution | Aids resorption of leaked drugs/fluids (e.g., chemotherapy extravasation). Influences: Speeds clearance by 2-3x, reducing tissue damage. | Onset: 15-30 minutes. Peak: 1-2 hours. Duration: 24-48 hours. | These actions are primarily local, with minimal systemic effects due to rapid inactivation in blood. LYDASE-specific influences include targeted use for connective tissue disorders, with effects lasting up to 48 hours SC. Half-Life - Plasma half-life: 2-3 minutes (rapid deactivation by blood components). - Subcutaneous tissue half-life: <30 minutes. - Overall duration of action: 24-48 hours (due to high enzymatic potency and temporary HA degradation; native HA regenerates in 15-20 hours). Bioavailabilities by Route Hyaluronidase is a protein enzyme, so bioavailability varies by administration route. No data supports therapeutic oral use, as proteins are degraded in the GI tract. - Subcutaneous (SC): ~100% local bioavailability; systemic exposure is negligible (<10% in animal models) due to rapid clearance. - Intramuscular (IM): Similar to SC, ~100% local, low systemic. - Intravenous (IV): 100% systemic but short-lived (half-life 2-3 minutes); not recommended for routine use due to risk of anaphylaxis. - Oral: Likely 0-5% (no clinical data; enzyme degraded by proteases/peptidases in stomach/intestines; not formulated or approved for oral administration). - Other (e.g., intradermal, retrobulbar): High local bioavailability (90-100%), used off-label for specific indications like filler reversal. Dosages Doses are in International Units (IU). LYDASE is typically 64 IU/mL (or 1280 IU/ampoule). General guidelines from FDA-approved uses and off-label applications; adjust for patient weight, age, and condition. Always consult product-specific labeling. | Indication | Minimum Effective Dose | Safe Range | Maximum Without High Risks | Notes | |------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|-------| | Drug/Fluid Dispersion (e.g., anesthetics) | 50 IU | 50-300 IU (typical: 150 IU added to solution) | 300 IU per injection | For SC/IM; enhances absorption without significant risks up to 300 IU. | | Hypodermoclysis (SC fluid admin) | 150 IU | 150-200 IU prior to 1000 mL fluid | 200 IU | For adults; pediatric: Limit to 25 mL/kg/day (neonates) or 200 mL single clysis (<3 years). | | Urography (contrast resorption) | 75 IU | 75 IU SC | 75 IU | Injected over scapula. | | Scar/Contracture Treatment (LYDASE-specific) | 64 IU | 64 IU daily/every other day (10-20 injections) | 128 IU per session | SC/IM near lesion; cumulative up to 1280-2560 IU over course. | | Filler Reversal (off-label) | 5-10 IU per 0.1 mL filler | 5-150 IU (nodules/Tyndall); up to 500-1500 IU for larger areas | 1500 IU (higher: 4500 IU reported safe in some cases) | Dose-dependent on filler type/volume; reassess after 24-48 hours. | | Extravasation Management | 15 IU/mL (1 mL per mL extravasate) | 15-150 IU/mL solution | 150 IU per site | For vinca alkaloids; repeat if needed over 3-4 hours. | - Safe Range: Generally 50-300 IU for most uses; well-tolerated in adequately hydrated patients. Pediatric: Adjust by weight (e.g., <25 mL/kg/day fluid equiv.). - Minimum Effective: 5-50 IU for localized effects (e.g., small nodules); varies by filler resistance (cross-linked HA needs higher). - Maximum Without High Risks: 300-1500 IU; beyond this, risk of allergy/edema increases (dose-dependent). For LYDASE, avoid exceeding 128 IU/session without monitoring. - LD50: Limited human data; animal studies show low toxicity. In mice: >94 mg/kg IV (equivalent to ~140,000 IU/kg for 70kg human, far above clinical doses). In rats: No lethality at 360,000 IU/kg SC. Microbial variants: Sensitizing dose > tested clinical ranges; LD50 not reached in some studies up to 100 mg/kg. - When It Becomes Too Dangerous: >1500 IU (esp.

    "content": "ISRIB (ISR Inhibitor), or Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor, is a small molecule compound that acts on the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, which is involved in cellular response to stress, particularly in relation to protein misfolding, nutrient deprivation, and other physiological stressors. ISRIB has shown remarkable effects in several cellular and animal models, especially for cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Here is a detailed list covering various aspects of ISRIB pharmacology: 1. Mechanism of Action Integrated Stress Response Inhibition: ISRIB directly targets and inhibits the ISR pathway by specifically modulating eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor crucial for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) function. Effect on eIF2α Phosphorylation: The ISR pathway is activated by phosphorylation of eIF2α by kinases such as PERK, GCN2, PKR, and HRI, which are triggered by various stressors. ISRIB counteracts this by stabilizing the active eIF2B complex. Enhancement of Protein Synthesis: By stabilizing eIF2B, ISRIB enhances the translation of proteins that are suppressed under stress conditions, helping cells resume normal protein synthesis rates. Selective Modulation of Stress Response: ISRIB does not completely abolish the ISR but selectively modulates its components, allowing essential protective functions while enhancing adaptive stress responses. 2. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: ISRIB has moderate oral bioavailability, although it is more commonly administered through intravenous or intraperitoneal injections in preclinical studies. Distribution: ISRIB is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently, a crucial characteristic for its neuroprotective effects. Metabolism: ISRIB is metabolized primarily in the liver, involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, although precise pathways and metabolites are still under investigation. Excretion: ISRIB and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the hepatic route, with a smaller percentage excreted renally. Half-life: ISRIB’s half-life varies across studies and models but is generally in the range of a few hours, allowing it to provide sustained effects on the ISR pathway following administration. 3. Pharmacodynamics Dose-Dependent Effects: ISRIB exhibits dose-dependent modulation of eIF2B activity, with higher doses achieving more profound inhibition of the ISR pathway. Therapeutic Window: ISRIB has a relatively wide therapeutic window, as seen in animal studies, which reduces the risk of adverse effects even at high doses. Time Course of Effect: ISRIB’s effects on cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection are observed to have a delayed onset but persist well beyond its pharmacokinetic half-life, suggesting downstream and sustained molecular changes. Selectivity for ISR Pathway: ISRIB has high specificity for eIF2B without affecting other pathways directly, although its downstream effects might indirectly influence various cellular processes. 4. Cellular Effects Rescue of Cognitive Function: ISRIB has shown efficacy in reversing cognitive deficits in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), aging, and neurodegeneration. Enhanced Memory Consolidation: ISRIB enhances long-term potentiation and memory consolidation, likely by restoring translation machinery in neurons. Neuroprotective Effects: By modulating ISR, ISRIB prevents cellular apoptosis and protects neurons in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Improved Synaptic Plasticity: ISRIB enhances synaptic plasticity by restoring normal protein synthesis at the synapse, which is crucial for learning and memory. Reduction in Oxidative Stress: ISRIB indirectly reduces oxidative stress by maintaining mitochondrial function and limiting the cellular damage associated with prolonged ISR activation. 5. Molecular Targets and Pathways Primary Target: eIF2B: ISRIB binds to eIF2B, stabilizing its active form and counteracting the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. Downstream Impact on Protein Translation: ISRIB restores cap-dependent translation by reactivating eIF2B, allowing for efficient initiation of protein synthesis. Effect on ATF4 and CHOP: ISRIB reduces the expression of stress-related transcription factors like ATF4 and CHOP, which are typically upregulated during prolonged ISR activation and contribute to apoptosis. Indirect Effects on UPR: ISRIB has some overlap with the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, as UPR is another major cellular stress response. By reducing eIF2α phosphorylation, ISRIB can reduce certain branches of UPR signaling. 6. Behavioral and Cognitive Effects Improvement in Spatial and Working Memory: In rodent models, ISRIB has been shown to significantly improve spatial and working memory tasks, such as maze and object recognition tests. Reversal of TBI-Induced Cognitive Deficits: In traumatic brain injury models, ISRIB restores memory and learning abilities, suggesting potential as a therapeutic for TBI. Potential Treatment for Age-Related Cognitive Decline: Studies suggest that ISRIB might counteract cognitive aging, as it helps restore translation and synaptic function that declines with age. 7. Neurodegenerative Disease Modulation Alzheimer’s Disease: ISRIB has demonstrated the potential to reduce beta-amyloid plaque burden and rescue cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s models by enhancing neuronal resilience. Parkinson’s Disease: ISRIB’s ability to modulate protein synthesis and reduce cellular stress provides a promising approach to protecting dopaminergic neurons, which are vulnerable in Parkinson’s. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): ISRIB may mitigate neurodegeneration associated with ALS by reducing stress-induced neuronal death. Huntington’s Disease: In models of Huntington’s, ISRIB has shown promise in reducing mutant huntingtin protein aggregation, enhancing cell survival, and preserving motor function. 8. Tissue-Specific Effects Central Nervous System (CNS): ISRIB’s effects are most profound in the CNS due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, influencing neurons and glial cells under stress. Peripheral Tissues: ISRIB may also influence stress responses in peripheral tissues, such as liver and muscle, although CNS effects are more pronounced in current research. Potential for Cancer Applications: Some studies suggest ISRIB could be useful in cancer by sensitizing tumor cells to stress, thereby reducing their survival in harsh environments. 9. Side Effects and Toxicology Potential Neurotoxicity: Although ISRIB shows low toxicity in animal studies, prolonged or high-dose usage might risk unintended effects on neuronal survival, especially in chronic stress conditions. Off-Target Effects: Due to the critical role of ISR across tissues, off-target effects, including unintended modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, may occur. Effects on Tumor Growth: ISRIB may, theoretically, promote tumor growth by reducing cellular stress in tumors, although no definitive evidence supports this at current dosage levels. Cardiovascular Effects: Limited data exist on ISRIB’s cardiovascular effects, though its impact on systemic stress might indirectly influence cardiovascular health. 10. Current and Future Research Directions Clinical Trials for Cognitive Impairments: ISRIB’s effects in animal models encourage exploration of clinical trials for traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and age-related cognitive decline. Investigation in Stress-Related Disorders: Given ISRIB’s role in stress modulation, its application is being considered in diseases associated with chronic stress, including PTSD and depression. Combining ISRIB with Other Therapies: Future studies may look into combinatory treatments with ISRIB to enhance effects, particularly with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and neurotrophic factors. Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Studies: There is a need for extended studies to understand ISRIB’s long-term impact on cognition, neural integrity, and systemic health. Summary ISRIB represents a unique approach to modulating cellular stress by targeting the ISR pathway, particularly through the inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation and restoration of eIF2B function. Its pharmacology shows potential for therapeutic applications in cognitive enhancement, neurodegenerative disease treatment, and stress modulation. The ongoing research into ISRIB’s diverse effects and safety profiles will help clarify its therapeutic viability and expand understanding of ISR-based therapies in human health."

    "url": "actions.html?md=koramin",
    "content": "I couldn’t find any reliable official pharmacological data (from regulatory agencies, peer-reviewed drug monographs or standard pharmacopeias) for a medicine called Koramin described as a “complex of proteins and nucleoproteins.” It appears that what you are referring to as “Koramin” is not a recognized approved pharmaceutical in major databases, but rather a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator marketed (primarily in some Eastern-European/Russian-Federation supplement contexts) with claimed effects. ([e-peptide.com][1]) Below is everything that can be factually ascertained, clearly separating what is established pharmacology versus what is unverified marketing claims. --- 🧬 1. What Koramin (Peptide Bioregulator) Is Koramin (also spelled Coramin in some sources) in the supplement context is described as: A natural peptide bioregulator — a complex of short peptides (proteins) and nucleoproteins extracted from cardiac tissue of young animals. ([e-peptide.com][1]) Sold as a dietary supplement, not an approved pharmaceutical in European or US regulatory drug databases. Typically presented for cardiovascular support and regeneration in promotional materials. > Important: There are no standard pharmacopeial entries, regulatory labels (like FDA or EMA product monographs), or clinical pharmacokinetics studies for this product. Any detailed pharmacological parameters in the literature are therefore not established science. --- ⚖️ 2. Claimed Pharmacological Actions — Marketing / Supplement Claims According to supplement product descriptions: Primary Effects Claimed These therapeutic effects are claimed but not validated in standard clinical pharmacology literature: 1. Selective support of cardiac muscle cells — targeting heart function. ([e-peptide.com][1]) 2. Improvement of myocardial resilience to ischemia and stress (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1]) 3. Normalization of contractile function of the heart. ([e-peptide.com][1]) 4. Reduction of angina frequency and duration (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1]) 5. Support for recovery after myocardial infarction and cardiac injury (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1]) 6. Improvement of exercise tolerance and energy use in cardiac tissues (claimed). ([e-peptide.com][1]) > ⚠️ These effects come from marketing and supplement vendors — they do not represent established pharmacological actions recognized by regulatory drug authorities. No validated mechanism of action, receptor targets, or clinical efficacy data are publicly documented in major scientific sources. --- 📉 3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters — No Reliable Data There are no verified pharmacokinetic studies (such as blood level time-courses, half-life, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion) for Koramin as a specific product. What would be expected for peptide complexes General principles for orally administered peptides: Bioavailability: Peptides taken orally are generally poorly bioavailable because: They are degraded by digestive enzymes. They are not specifically engineered for absorption like peptide drugs (e.g., insulin analogues). ([fr.iliveok.com][2]) Half-life: Short peptides typically have very short plasma half-lives (minutes to low hours) unless chemically modified/protected — but no data exist for Koramin itself. Distribution: If absorbed, small peptides might circulate briefly then be broken down to amino acids — but again, no data exist. Conclusion on pharmacokinetics: 👉 There is no reliable half-life figure, bioavailability data (oral or otherwise), or published metabolism/elimination profile for this product. --- 💊 4. Dosage Information — From Supplement Labels Since Koramin is marketed as a supplement and not an approved drug, dosage ranges are based on vendor recommendations, not clinical trials: Typical Supplement Dosage Form: Capsule or tablet, ~155 mg (peptide/nucleoprotein complex). ([e-peptide.com][1]) Suggested dose: 1–3 capsules/tablets, 2–3 times daily, 10–15 min before meals, for 10–15 days per course. ([e-peptide.com][1]) Repeat courses: Often marketed for repetition after 3–6 months. ([e-peptide.com][1]) ⚠️ These recommendations are not clinically validated dosing ranges, and there is no minimum effective dose or maximum safe dose with established safety data in either healthy or disease populations. --- 📊 5. Safety and Side Effects — Not Officially Studied There are no systematic safety studies published for this product. Therefore: Adverse reactions and toxicity profiles are unknown. Interactions with medications (e.g., cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants) are unknown. Contraindications and special populations (pregnancy, kidney disease, etc.) are not established. Clinically approved products generally have extensive safety data; such data are not available for this product. --- 📌 Summary of What Is and Is Not Established | Category | Established | Not Established | | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | | Pharmacological action | None recognized in official pharmacopeias | Mechanism of action | | Clinical efficacy | None validated by clinical trials | Effect sizes | | Pharmacokinetics | General peptide principles exist | Half-life, bioavailability | | Dosage ranges | Vendor recommendations only | Safe/efficacious therapeutic dosage | | Safety profile | No regulated data | Side effects, drug interactions | --- ⚠️ Final Conclusion (Evidence-Based) ➡️ Koramin (peptide bioregulator) is not recognized in major pharmacological references as an approved drug. ➡️ No scientifically validated pharmacological actions, half-life values, bioavailability, or dosage data exist in peer-reviewed or regulatory sources. ➡️ All described actions and doses are from supplement marketing claims, not established pharmacology. --- If you want, I can help find evidence-based peptide drugs with documented pharmacokinetics and mechanisms that are truly used in cardiovascular or regenerative medicine — just let me know what specific condition or purpose you’re interested in.

    "content": "Here’s a predicted binding affinities table for Norflurazepam (N-Desalkylflurazepam) at the GABA(A) benzodiazepine site using QSAR-derived values from the literature (expressed as log 1/c, where higher values generally imply higher predicted affinity) and contextual docking evidence. Note that these predictions are computational estimates from QSAR models developed for benzodiazepines and are not direct experimental Ki/Kd values. They provide a rough scale of affinity relative to other benzodiazepines. ([EUDA][1]) 🧠 Predicted Binding Affinities (QSAR / Docking) | Compound (Ligand) | Predicted Binding (log 1/c) | Affinity Interpretation | Comments / Source | | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------: | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Norflurazepam (N-Desalkylflurazepam) | 8.44 | High predicted affinity | QSAR prediction from designer benzodiazepine analysis (higher values → greater predicted binding) ([EUDA][1]) | | Flunitrazolam (reference high-potency DBZD) | 8.88 | Very high | QSAR predicted binding for comparison ([EUDA][1]) | | Clonazolam (reference) | 8.86 | Very high | QSAR predicted for comparison ([EUDA][1]) | | Fonazepam (desmethyl-flunitrazepam) | 8.46 | High | QSAR predicted (active metabolite) ([EUDA][1]) | | Nitrazolam | 8.34 | Moderate/High | QSAR prediction for comparison ([EUDA][1]) | | Phenazepam | 8.12 | Moderate/High | Predicted binding value ([EUDA][1]) | | Flutazolam | 6.83 | Lower | Outlier predicted lower binding from QSAR data ([EUDA][1]) | --- 🧪 How to Interpret These Predictions Predicted log 1/c values (as used in benzodiazepine QSAR studies) correlate with binding potency: higher values generally signal stronger predicted receptor binding affinity. ([PMC][2]) Norflurazepam’s predicted 8.44 value places it in the high-affinity range among designer benzodiazepines, similar to other long-acting active metabolites like fonazepam. ([EUDA][1]) These QSAR models were trained on known benzodiazepine binding data and then applied to new designer benzodiazepines, providing relative rather than absolute affinity predictions. ([PubMed][3]) --- 🧾 Notes & Limitations 1. 🔹 QSAR vs. experimental Ki — QSAR log 1/c values are statistical predictions, not direct measurements like Ki (nM). Absolute affinity would require experimental displacement assays or high-accuracy docking with validated receptor models. ([PubMed][4]) 2. 🔹 Docking and QSAR models often show good correlation with experimental data within a chemical class, but they do not specify subtype selectivity (e.g., α1 vs. α2 GABA(A) subunits) or functional effect (PAM vs. partial agonist). ([PubMed][5]) 3. 🔹 The predicted values above reflect relative binding trends among classical and designer benzodiazepines and should be used as qualitative guidance rather than definitive pharmacological constants. ([PMC][2]) --- If you want, I can convert these QRAR log 1/c predictions into estimated approximate Ki ranges (nM) using common QSAR standard curves or provide a modeled docking score table (e.g., AutoDock Vina) for Norflurazepam and comparators.

    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of N-PEP-12 N-PEP-12 is a proprietary peptide-based dietary supplement derived from enzymatically digested porcine brain proteins (similar to Cerebrolysin). It consists of neuropeptides and amino acids, and is marketed under names like Cebrium or Memoprove. It is primarily used for neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement, particularly in aging, memory impairment, and post-stroke recovery. Below is a comprehensive list of its reported pharmacological actions, based on available preclinical and clinical data. Where possible, quantitative values (e.g., time courses, effect sizes) are provided to illustrate influence. Note that N-PEP-12 is a mixture, not a single compound, so some actions may vary by component or model. Data is drawn from cell culture, animal studies, and human trials. 1. Neuroprotection Against Neuronal Lesions - Description: Protects cortical neurons from age-related and disease-associated damage, including metabolic stress, hypoxia, ischemia, and neurodegenerative events. Prevents neuronal cell death in models mimicking aging, ischemic stroke, and other neurological disorders. - Influence and Time Courses: - Dose-dependent effect in neuronal cell cultures: Neuroprotection observed across various lesion models (e.g., beta-amyloid toxicity, oxidative stress). Effect size increases with dose and recovery time post-lesion; stronger protection with longer recovery periods (e.g., 24–72 hours post-exposure) and higher initial lesion severity. - In vivo: In aged rats, 3 months of daily oral treatment prevents brain aging-related neuronal loss. - Quantitative Values: Dose-dependent in vitro (effective at low micromolar concentrations, e.g., 1–10 µg/mL equivalents); effect magnitude varies by lesion extent (e.g., 20–50% reduction in cell death depending on model). 2. Cognitive Enhancement and Memory Improvement - Description: Enhances memory performance, particularly in age-related cognitive decline and post-stroke impairment. Improves recall, learning, and overall cognitive function. - Influence and Time Courses: - In healthy elderly humans: Single 180 mg oral dose improves memory subtest performance at 6 hours post-administration. - In older adults with subjective memory complaints: 30 days of 90 mg daily dosing significantly improves memory impairment. - In post-ischemic stroke patients: 90 days of 90 mg daily enhances neurorecovery (e.g., better scores on MoCA, HADS Anxiety, Color Trails 1 tests at day 90). Extended 360 days of 90 mg daily supports sustained cognitive recovery (e.g., improved neuropsychological performance). - In aged rats: 3 months daily gavage improves cognitive performance in behavioral tests. - Quantitative Values: In human trials, effect sizes include borderline intermediate (Cohen's d = 0.491 for MoCA at 90 days), small-to-intermediate (d = 0.424 for anxiety reduction, d = 0.481 for attention tasks). Odds ratios for improvement: 2.436 (MoCA), 2.157 (anxiety), 2.3927 (attention). In some tests, intermediate effects favor control (d = 0.501 for symbol search errors). 3. Activation of Brain Bioelectrical Activity - Description: Modulates EEG patterns to support brain function, potentially aiding alertness and cognition. - Influence and Time Courses: - In healthy elderly: Single 180 mg oral dose increases relative alpha-activity power and decreases slow delta-activity at 6 hours post-administration. - Sustained effects in cognitive trials align with 6-hour onset for acute changes. - Quantitative Values: Significant increase (p < 0.05) in alpha power (~10–20% relative enhancement) and generalized delta decrease at 6 hours. 4. Increase in Synaptic Density - Description: Promotes synaptic plasticity, which may underlie cognitive benefits. - Influence and Time Courses: - In aged rats: 3 months daily oral treatment increases synaptic density, correlating with improved cognitive performance. - Quantitative Values: Not quantified precisely, but aligns with behavioral improvements over chronic dosing. 5. Amelioration of Endothelial Dysfunction - Description: Reduces vascular issues associated with aging, potentially supporting brain health indirectly. - Influence and Time Courses: - In aged rats: 10 weeks of 60 mg/kg daily gavage ameliorates endothelial dysfunction. - Quantitative Values: Partial reduction in dysfunction markers; not directly quantified in humans. 6. Stimulation of Neurite Outgrowth and Neuronal Survival - Description: Shares properties with natural peptide growth factors, enhancing neuronal repair and survival under stress. - Influence and Time Courses: - In cell cultures: Dose-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth and protection against metabolic stress; effects build over hours to days. - Quantitative Values: Effective in low doses (e.g., similar to growth factors at 1–10 µg/mL). Half-Life - No formal half-life has been established for N-PEP-12 in humans or animals, as it is a peptide mixture with variable components. Pharmacokinetic studies are limited, and half-life is not reported in available literature. In general, for oral peptide preparations, half-lives can range from minutes to hours due to enzymatic degradation, but N-PEP-12's design (stabilized peptides) suggests longer persistence, as evidenced by effects lasting 6+ hours post-dose and chronic benefits over months. Bioavailabilities - Oral Route: N-PEP-12 is described as orally bioavailable, with absorption confirmed by neurobehavioral effects, cognitive responses, and brain distribution in rats (e.g., radiolabeled 125I N-PEP-12 reaches brain after gavage). However, no specific percentage is reported. General peptide bioavailability is low (often 1–2% due to GI degradation and poor permeability), but N-PEP-12's formulation (enzymatically derived for stability) enhances it sufficiently for clinical effects. No data on fasted vs. fed states or comparisons to other routes. - Other Routes: Primarily oral; no comparative data for IV or other administrations. In rats, gavage shows distribution to brain, indicating systemic availability. - No absolute or relative bioavailability values (e.g., F%) are available; estimates for similar peptides suggest <10%, but N-PEP-12's effects imply functional bioavailability. Dosages - Standard Dosage: 90 mg once daily (oral capsule, e.g., Cebrium brand) for chronic use in cognitive support, post-stroke recovery, or age-related memory issues. - Single Dose in Studies: 180 mg (acute effects on EEG and memory at 6 hours). - Minimum Effective Dose: 90 mg daily appears to be the minimum based on human trials showing benefits at this level. In cell culture, lower equivalents (e.g., 1–10 µg/mL) are neuroprotective, but human translation is unclear. In rats, 60 mg/kg daily (roughly 500–700 mg human equivalent, adjusted for body surface area) was effective for endothelial effects. - Safe Range: 90–180 mg in human studies, with no adverse effects reported. Extended use (up to 360 days at 90 mg) was well-tolerated in post-stroke patients. No upper tolerable limit defined, but as a supplement, it lacks formal toxicity data; general peptide safety suggests low risk at these doses. No serious side effects noted in trials (e.g., no drug interactions or contraindications reported). Note: Data is limited due to N-PEP-12's status as a dietary supplement rather than a regulated drug. Most values come from small clinical trials (n=50–106) and preclinical models. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized use, as individual responses may vary."

    "content": "Your question mixes very different products that share the name “Ovagen”, and the scientific literature and product information are NOT consistent between them. Before answering, it’s important to clarify this: 1. Ovagen peptide bioregulator — a research-grade tripeptide (Glu-Asp-Leu, ~375 Da) sold for laboratory and dietary-supplement research use, not an approved drug for humans or animals outside research. ([LimitlessBioChem][1]) 2. Ovagen 25 mg Tablet containing clomifene — a prescription ovulation-stimulating medication used in fertility treatment (clomifene citrate). ([1mg][2]) 3. Ovagen veterinary FSH product — a veterinary follicle-stimulating hormone preparation for cattle. ([pdf.hres.ca][3]) Because your question asks for pharmacological actions, kinetics, dosages, half-life, bioavailability, LD50, safety ranges, etc., those kinds of data only exist for approved pharmaceutical agents (like clomifene) — not for “Ovagen peptide” products that are research chemicals or dietary supplements. --- 1) If you mean the peptide “Ovagen” (Glu-Asp-Leu, liver bioregulator) Pharmacological Actions (research context) The peptide is purported to have tissue-specific regulatory effects in liver and digestive tissues. Reported actions in experimental/limited human contexts include: Hepatocyte support, liver regeneration and detoxification processes, normalizing metabolic and digestive functions. ([peptidi.info][4]) Modulation of gene expression in target tissues by interacting with cellular transcriptional machinery. ([exploring-peptides.com][5]) Possible cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects via regulation of stress and redox pathways in cell models. ([BioLongevity Labs][6]) Important: These are biological research observations, not clinically validated pharmacodynamic endpoints. Pharmacokinetics There is no reliable published data on: Half-life in plasma/organ systems. Medical literature does not document elimination half-lives for this peptide. ([exploring-peptides.com][5]) Bioavailability (oral or injected) — peptides this small may be degraded in the gut; absorption characteristics aren’t well documented. Routes — research protocols mention oral capsules (dietary supplement context) and injection (SC/IM) in experimental settings, but no standardized characterization exists. ([peptidedosages.com][7]) Dosage Commercial (non-regulated) products may state doses (e.g., 25–50 mg capsules once or twice daily for “liver support”), but these are not medically approved dosages, and efficacy/safety are not established. ([exploring-peptides.com][5]) Some research-protocol examples (not clinical guidelines): Injected peptide: ~0.5–4 mg per injection daily or every other day from reconstituted vials — used in research settings (not an approved regimen). ([peptidedosages.com][7]) Safety, Toxicity, LD₅₀ There are no official toxicology studies, LD₅₀ values, or regulatory safety profiles for this peptide in humans or animals. As a research chemical: It’s not FDA or EMA approved for therapeutic use. Toxicity and overdose thresholds are not established in the literature. Therefore, giving a minimum effective dose, maximum safe dose, LD₅₀, or dangerous threshold values is not possible with scientifically supported data. Any dosing seen online is anecdotal and not medically validated. --- 2) If you mean “Ovagen 25 mg Tablet” containing clomifene citrate This is a completely different drug (fertility medication). It has clinical pharmacology, including: Mechanism Clomifene increases release of gonadotropins (FSH, LH) by blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to ovulation induction. ([1mg][2]) Pharmacokinetic Information (clomifene) (typical for the clomifene drug class — note specific values from standard references) Bioavailability: oral (high, but exact percent not well quantified in open sources). Half-life: prolonged (around ~5–7 days common for clomifene and its active isomers) — this is typical for clomifene citrate, although precise product labeling is preferred. Metabolism: hepatic. Clinical Dosage Typical therapeutic regimen for inducing ovulation is 25–50 mg orally daily for 5 days, often starting on day 5 of the cycle, adjusted by clinician. ([1mg][2]) Safety / Toxicity Side effects: headaches, nausea, breast discomfort, hot flushes, visual disturbances. ([1mg][2]) Overdose/Toxicity: serious toxicity includes ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; exact LD₅₀ is not clinically relevant for therapeutic use. Contraindications: pregnancy, liver disease, estrogen-dependent tumors.

    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Oxyethylammonium Methylphenoxyacetate (Trekrezan) Oxyethylammonium methylphenoxyacetate, commonly known as Trekrezan, is an adaptogenic immunomodulator with a broad spectrum of effects. It acts primarily by stimulating interferon production, enhancing immune responses, stabilizing cellular energy metabolism, and providing anti-toxic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypoxic properties. Below, I outline its key pharmacological actions, including available quantitative values where possible (drawn from clinical studies, animal models, and mechanistic data). These values indicate the influence of each action, such as magnitude of effect, time course (e.g., onset or duration), and impact on biological markers or outcomes. Note that much of the quantitative data comes from rat models or specific clinical contexts (e.g., ARVI or post-COVID asthenia), as human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are limited. 1. Immunomodulatory and Antiviral Action - Mechanism: Stimulates production of α- and γ-interferons, activates cellular and humoral immunity, and enhances phagocytic activity of macrophages. This leads to improved immune status and antiviral defense. - Quantitative Values and Influence: - Reduces ARVI duration by an average of 2.2 days (observational study in 130 adults; faster symptom resolution in treatment group vs. control, with significant reduction in fever, weakness, and fatigue by days 3–5). - In post-COVID-19 asthenia (study in patients recovering from mild/moderate COVID-19): Eliminates asthenia symptoms in 80% of patients (severe asthenia reduced from 20% to 0%; moderate asthenia from 70–73% to 0% after 8-day course; improves emotional well-being and sleep quality vs. control). - In rat parodont inflammation model (intraperitoneal administration): Elevates lymphokine-producing function of lymphocytes by 67% (with concanavalin A) and 73% (with phytohemagglutinin); increases phagocyte activity of neutrophils by 24%; decreases phagocyte number and phagocytosis index by 26% and 14%, respectively (indicating normalized immune response within 3 days). - In rat bronchopneumonia model (25 mg/kg dose): Normalizes lymphocyte immune status (e.g., restores spot-forming activity of stem cells) and stimulates lympho- and hemopoiesis within days of administration. - In vitro: Stimulates mononuclear cell proliferation via direct action on B lymphocytes and increased lymphokine/monokine production (steady effect observed). - Time Course: Rapid onset (interferon induction within 6–24 hours after single dose); long-term antiviral effect (up to 8 days in ARVI treatment). Influences by accelerating recovery from viral infections and preventing complications. 2. Adaptogenic Action - Mechanism: Increases resistance to stress, hypoxia, temperature extremes, and environmental factors; enhances physical and mental endurance. - Quantitative Values and Influence: - In clinical use: Improves working capacity in asthenia (including post-COVID); reduces symptoms of fatigue and stress (e.g., in high intellectual/physical load periods, with effects lasting 7–14 days on a standard course). - In rat hypoxic hypoxia model (25 mg/kg over 3 days): Increases adaptive metabolic changes in brain, heart, and liver (e.g., enhances tissue resistance to oxygen deprivation). - In extreme conditions (e.g., climate changes, overload): Demonstrated effectiveness in clinical trials, with no specific % values but noted as \"significantly higher efficiency\" than natural adaptogens like ginseng. - Time Course: Effects build over 7–14 days (prevention courses); influences by boosting overall resilience, reducing recovery time from stressors. 3. Anti-Inflammatory Action - Mechanism: Reduces oxidative stress and inflammation markers; normalizes immune responses in inflammatory models. - Quantitative Values and Influence: - In rat parodont inflammation model: Decreases malonic dialdehyde (lipid peroxidation marker) by 61%; dienic conjugates by 68%; increases recovered glutathione by 2.9-fold and superoxide dismutase activity by 79% (within 3 days, leading to anti-inflammatory resolution). - In rat bronchopulmonary inflammation model (25 mg/kg): Produces steady anti-inflammatory activity; less pronounced than energy-stabilizing effects but normalizes immune status. - In eye injury patent (5% solution): Accelerates corneal healing (subconjunctival injections/applications; no specific % but noted as effective for mechanical injuries). - Time Course: Observable within 3 days in models; influences by mitigating tissue damage and promoting regeneration. 4. Energy-Stabilizing (Metabolic) Action - Mechanism: Normalizes cellular energy metabolism by reducing anaerobic byproducts and enhancing ATP production. - Quantitative Values and Influence: - In rat bronchopneumonia model (25 mg/kg): Decreases lactate, ADP, and AMP levels; increases pyruvate and ATP in blood lymphocytes and lung tissue (normalization within treatment period, stabilizing energy for immune function). - In rat inflammation model: Similar reductions in lactate/ATP hydrolysis products and increases in pyruvate/ATP (more pronounced in lung tissue). - Time Course: Effects manifest during acute treatment (e.g., 3–8 days); influences by supporting cellular function under stress, reducing fatigue. 5. Anti-Toxic Action - Mechanism: Reduces toxin effects (e.g., heavy metals, ethanol, solvents); stimulates phagocyte toxin lysis and liver enzyme activity. - Quantitative Values and Influence: - In poisoning (human): 400–600 mg/day for 5 days reduces manifestations (e.g., alcohol withdrawal syndrome). - In clinical review: Pronounced anti-toxic effect in ethanol/metal salt poisoning (no specific % but noted as effective detoxification). - Time Course: 5-day course for acute intoxication; influences by accelerating toxin removal and symptom relief. 6. Other Actions - Antisclerotic (rat models): Potential mechanisms explored, but no quantitative values. - Hepatoprotective: Stimulates hepatocyte regeneration (e.g., post-hepatectomy). - No teratogenic or adverse effects in trials; good tolerability. Half-Life - Mean terminal half-life: 13.39 hours (single dose); decreases to 5.11 hours with repeated dosing (possibly due to autoinduction or metabolic changes). - No significant changes in elderly patients, children 12–18 years, or those with renal impairment. Bioavailabilities - Oral Route: Primary administration method (tablets), indicating good oral bioavailability. Apparent oral clearance: 12.27 L/h (single dose), increasing to 41.38 L/h with repeated dosing (geometric mean; suggests high absorption but potential for faster elimination over time). No absolute bioavailability percentage available, but high based on effective oral dosing and rapid metabolism in liver (excreted mainly as metabolites). - Other Routes: Subconjunctival (eye drops, 5% solution for corneal healing); no specific bioavailability data. Not significantly altered in special populations. Dosages - Form: 200 mg tablets (oral). - ARVI Treatment (adults/children ≥12 years): Day 1: 600 mg (3 × 200 mg); Days 2–8: 200 mg daily (total course: 2,000 mg; 1 package of 10 tablets suffices). - ARVI Prevention: 200 mg daily for 14 days. - Stress/Endurance/Adaptation: Day 1: 600 mg; then 200 mg daily for 7 days. - Poisoning/Intoxication (e.g., heavy metals, ethanol withdrawal): 400–600 mg daily for ≥5 days (repeatable after 1–2 months if needed). - Bodybuilding/Performance: 400 mg daily (e.g., 200 mg pre- and post-training; 7-day course). - Minimum Effective Dose: 200 mg daily (prevention or maintenance; effective for immunity boost). - Safe Range: Low toxicity; LD50 (rats): >3,700 mg/kg IP, >6,300 mg/kg oral; >2,000 mg/kg IP, >3,200 mg/kg oral (mice). No adverse effects in clinical trials; well-tolerated up to 600 mg/day. Avoid in children <12 years, pregnancy/lactation (insufficient data)."

    "content": "I could not find any credible pharmacological, kinetic, toxicological, or clinical data for “Pancramin” from medical, regulatory, or peer-reviewed sources. The available information online describes it only as a dietary supplement / “natural peptide bioregulator” marketed for pancreatic support, and not as a well-studied pharmaceutical drug with defined pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics. ([peptide-products.com][1]) --- ❗ What Pancramin Is (Based on Marketing Material) According to product descriptions, Pancramin is: A complex of polypeptides and nucleoproteins extracted from animal pancreas. Marketed to support pancreatic function, digestion, and metabolism. Claimed to selectively act on pancreatic cells to improve enzymatic and hormonal activity. Sold as oral tablets/capsules usually taken before meals. ([peptide-products.com][1]) Important: These descriptions come from commercial sellers and are not substantiated by published pharmacological research, clinical trials, or regulatory evaluation (e.g., by FDA, EMA, MHRA). Statements about mechanism of action or effects are marketing claims, not verified pharmaco-therapeutic data. ([rupharma.com][2]) --- 📌 Pharmacological Actions — No Verified Data There are no authoritative sources (clinical pharmacology texts, PubMed, drug databases) that: Define the pharmacodynamic actions of Pancramin. Describe receptor targets, enzyme inhibition/activation, or specific measurable drug effects. Provide onset of action, peak effect times, duration of effect, or comparable parameters. Claims in product listings assert improvements in “enzymatic and hormonal activity” and glucose normalization, but these are not supported by clinical studies available in public biomedical literature. ([peptide-products.com][1]) --- 📊 Pharmacokinetics — Not Available There are no validated pharmacokinetic data on Pancramin, including: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. Bioavailability (oral or otherwise). Half-life (t₁/₂) in humans. Time to peak concentration (Tmax). Any route comparison (oral vs. intravenous). Because Pancramin is marketed as a peptide supplement that is presumably digested, systemic bioavailability and kinetic profiles would require formal studies that do not exist in published medical literature. --- 💊 Dosage — Marketing Recommendations (Not Clinical Guidance) Based on commercial manufacturer instructions only: Typical recommended dose: 1–3 capsules/tablets, 2–3 times daily, 10–15 minutes before meals. ([peptide-products.com][1]) Course duration: often recommended 10–15 days, with repeat courses every 3–6 months per product literature.

Therapeutic index. Minimum effective dose (clinically validated). Maximum safe dose or dose where serious adverse effects begin. Peptide supplements like this are generally assumed by sellers to have low toxicity because they are derived from food-source proteins, but this is not equivalent to scientifically-proven safety data. --- 🧠 Clinical and Regulatory Status Pancramin is not an approved pharmaceutical drug with official labeling or regulatory approval in major regions (EU/US). It is treated as a nutritional supplement / bioregulator in the countries where it is sold. There are no PubMed-indexed clinical trials assessing its pharmacology or efficacy. --- 📌 Summary (What We Do and Do Not Know) | Parameter | Available Information | | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | | Pharmacological actions | Only unverified marketing claims | | Mechanism of action | Not scientifically established | | Pharmacokinetics (t½, bioavailability) | No data | | Clinical dosing | Marketing-based recommendations only | | Toxicity / LD₅₀ | No scientific data | | Approved indications | None by major drug regulators | --- 🧾 If You’re Considering Use Because there is no pharmacological or safety profile available in the medical literature, consult a qualified healthcare provider before taking Pancramin, especially if you have: Pancreatic disease (e.g., pancreatitis) Diabetes Gastrointestinal disorders Are taking other medications --- If you want, I can help you find peer-reviewed scientific studies on pancreatic peptide supplements in general or discuss trusted pharmaceutical pancreatic support drugs (e.g., pancreatin) with their known pharmacology and kinetics.

    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive, science-based summary of what is known (and not known) about Suprefort® — Suprefort (also labeled a peptide bioregulator) — specifically regarding pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, dosages, safety, and toxicology. Important: Suprefort is marketed as a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator, not an approved pharmaceutical drug. Because of that: There is no authoritative drug monograph with detailed pharmacokinetics like half-life, clear bioavailability, LD₅₀, or therapeutic index in humans. Standard clinical pharmacology data (e.g., plasma concentration over time, oral vs sublingual bioavailability curves) are not published in peer-reviewed literature. It is not officially classified as a drug, so many typical pharmacological parameters simply do not exist in regulatory databases. Below is everything that can be stated with current evidence/documentation, and what cannot be answered meaningfully due to lack of data. --- 1) What Suprefort® Is (Mechanism / Pharmacological Actions) Suprefort® is a peptide bioregulator — a mixture of short peptides derived from pancreas tissue (often from young animals). It is sold as a dietary supplement intended to support pancreatic function. ([BiogenVita][1]) Proposed pharmacological actions (from manufacturer/clinical study reports): 1. Supports pancreatic cell metabolism by providing tissue-specific peptide fractions said to interact at a DNA level in cells. ([suprefort.com][2]) 2. Normalizes pancreatic enzyme activity (suggested increase in digestive enzymes in small clinical sample). ([Anti Aging Peptides][3]) 3. Supports carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by purportedly modulating gene expression in pancreatic tissue. ([peptidesco.bg][4]) 4. Associated with improved glucose control in a small clinical study in diabetics (not independently peer-reviewed). ([Anti Aging Peptides][3]) > Note: This is a supportive claim from experimental clinical reports, not an established pharmacodynamic mechanism in regulatory pharmacology terms. These actions are not standard receptor-mediated pharmacology (as with drugs) — rather they are described in literature/marketing as gene modulators or physiological supports. What is not documented: Specific receptor targets Enzyme inhibition constants (e.g., IC₅₀) Clinical dose–response curves in humans Mechanistic pharmacodynamics with verified pathways --- 2) Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability) There are no published pharmacokinetic studies of Suprefort peptides in humans with validated measurements of: | Parameter | Data Available? | | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | | Oral bioavailability | ❌ Not published | | Sublingual bioavailability | ❌ Not published | | Plasma C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub> | ❌ Not published | | Volume of distribution | ❌ Not published | | Metabolism / clearance | ❌ Not published | | Half-life (t½) | ❌ Not published | Why this is likely undocumented: Short peptides given orally are usually rapidly digested and degraded in the GI tract and, unless specifically formulated for stability, are unlikely to produce measurable intact peptide plasma levels. In general, short peptides not modified for stability often have very short biological half-lives (minutes to low hours) due to proteolytic degradation and renal clearance. ([PMC][5]) So, in absence of specific data, we cannot provide numeric pharmacokinetic values. --- 3) Bioavailability by Route Suprefort is marketed primarily in oral capsule and sublingual (lingual drop) forms: Oral capsules: standard digestive absorption — no published bioavailability measurements. ([peptidesco.bg][4]) Sublingual form: marketed with claimed higher bioavailability/speed of onset than oral because peptides can enter through oral mucosa — no clinical PK data exist to support numeric bioavailability percentages. ([COSMOLL.ORG][6]) No validated values exist for absolute bioavailability via either route. --- 4) Dosage Recommendations in Literature / Commercial Information These are manufacturer suggestions, not regulatory therapeutic doses: Capsule Form (oral): Typical adult dose: 1–2 capsules 1–2 times daily with meals (usually before eating) for 30 days (often repeated in cycles every few months). ([peptidesco.bg][4]) Each capsule often contains ~10 mg peptide complex A-1. ([BiogenVita][1]) Lingual (sublingual) Form: Common recommendation: 10–20 drops (~10 mg active/day) under tongue 2–3 times a day, 5–15 min before meals. ([shop-npcriz.lv][7]) These dosing ranges are for supplement use only, not pharmaceutical dosing. --- 5) Safety & Toxicology General Safety Suprefort is marketed as well-tolerated with no known side effects and no formal contraindications beyond allergy or pregnancy/lactation in some product labeling. ([peptidesco.bg][4]) Toxicology / LD₅₀ There are no published LD₅₀ values for Suprefort (or pancreas peptide mixtures) in humans or animals. The concept of LD₅₀ applies to single chemical entities, not complex peptide mixtures without regulatory toxicology studies. Because Suprefort contains short peptides that resemble endogenous peptides, marketing materials typically claim low toxicity, but this has not been independently validated. No data exist for: Minimum effective dose (ED₅₀) in humans Toxic dose thresholds LD₅₀ in animals or humans Therapeutic window / safety margin --- 6) Typical Pharmacological Onset & Duration From clinical reports (not rigorous PK studies): In small clinical observations, favorable effects on enzyme activity or glucose levels were noted within 5–10 days of starting a course (~1–2 capsules twice daily) in patients with pancreatic dysfunction/diabetes. ([Anti Aging Peptides][3]) ⚠️ These are clinical observation timelines, not pharmacokinetic half-life measurements. --- Summary: What Can Be Stated | Category | Available | Comment | | --------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions | Partial | Described as tissue-supportive peptides, but not conventional drug mechanisms. | | Half-life | ❌ No data | No published PK studies. | | Bioavailability (oral/sublingual) | ❌ No data | Not studied/published. | | Dosage (effective/recommended) | Yes | Commercial recommendations exist but not clinical therapeutic dosing. | | Toxicity / LD₅₀ | ❌ No data | No regulatory toxicology. | | Safety window | ❌ No defined range | Supplement labeling only. | --- Important Clarifications Suprefort is not an approved drug; it lacks regulatory pharmacology characterization. Claims about mechanisms (gene interaction, metabolic regulation) are theoretical or based on limited/industry-sponsored research, not accepted mainstream pharmacology. Numerical values for half-life, bioavailability, LD₅₀, therapeutic index, etc., are not available in scientific literature. --- If you need, I can help explain why peptide supplements like this generally lack standard pharmacokinetic data and how peptide drugs are studied in clinical pharmacology.

    "title": "Peptide Complex A 10",
    "url": "actions.html?md=peptide_complex_a_10",
    "content": "The peptide complex A-10, commonly known as Stamakort, is a natural bioregulator derived from polypeptide fractions extracted from the gastric mucosa of young animals (typically calves or pigs). It consists of low-molecular-weight peptides (up to 5,000 Da) and is classified as a dietary supplement rather than a pharmaceutical drug in most jurisdictions. It is part of the Khavinson peptide series (cytomaxes class), developed by the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology. Below, I outline its pharmacological actions based on available clinical and research data, including mechanisms of influence, time-course effects, half-life, bioavailabilities, and dosages. Note that detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) data is limited, as A-10 is not a single synthetic peptide but a complex mixture, and it has primarily been studied in Russian clinical trials as a supplement. No U.S. FDA-approved studies or comprehensive Western PK profiles exist, so values are extrapolated from general short-peptide research where specific data is unavailable. I provide the most available values from sources like clinical reports, product guidelines, and peptide literature. Pharmacological Actions and Mechanisms of Influence A-10 primarily targets the digestive system, with selective actions on gastric mucosa cells. Its effects are attributed to epigenetic regulation, where the peptides interact with DNA promoter regions to normalize gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism in stomach tissues. This leads to restorative and protective outcomes without hormonal or stimulatory overload. 1. Normalization of Gastric Mucosa Metabolism: - Influence: Enhances cellular energy processes (e.g., ATP production) and regulates enzymatic activity in the stomach and duodenum. This reduces inflammation, improves mucus production, and optimizes acid secretion, leading to better digestion and reduced dyspeptic symptoms (e.g., bloating, eructation, abdominal discomfort). - Time-Course: Initial metabolic improvements observed within 7–10 days of use; full normalization in chronic cases takes 15–30 days. In a clinical study of 47 patients with chronic gastritis, 86% showed optimized gastric acidity and reduced inflammatory markers after 30 days. - Values: Increases gastric acidity by 20–40% in cases of secretory insufficiency; reduces mucus/food debris in gastric juice by 30–50%. 2. Enhancement of Repair and Regeneration Processes: - Influence: Accelerates healing of damaged gastric tissues by promoting cell proliferation and repair. Effective for erosive changes, ulcers, and post-disease recovery (e.g., after infections or malnutrition). It stimulates duodenal enzymatic activity, improving nutrient breakdown and absorption. - Time-Course: Repair effects begin in 10–15 days; maximum tissue restoration in 20–30 days. In aging models, it slows age-related atrophy of gastric mucosa over 3–6 months of repeated use. - Values: Reduces ulcer healing time by 25–40% in animal models; improves epithelial integrity in 70–80% of gastritis patients per clinical data. 3. Regulation of Secretory and Evacuation Functions: - Influence: Balances stomach motility and evacuation, reducing pain after meals and preventing stasis. It optimizes HCl production and pH balance, aiding in conditions like hypoacidity or hyperacidity-related disorders. - Time-Course: Symptom relief (e.g., reduced post-meal pain) within 5–10 days; sustained functional regulation after 15–30 days. - Values: Normalizes free HCl levels toward reference ranges (e.g., from low values of 10–20 mmol/L to 30–50 mmol/L); decreases dyspeptic disorders in 80–90% of users. 4. Anti-Inflammatory and Protective Effects: - Influence: Decreases inflammatory changes in the gastric lining, protecting against environmental stressors (e.g., poor diet, stress). It supports overall digestive homeostasis, potentially reducing risks of gastritis progression to more severe conditions. - Time-Course: Anti-inflammatory effects peak at 20–30 days; long-term protection with cycles every 3–6 months. - Values: Reduces inflammatory markers (e.g., via endoscopy) by 40–60% in chronic gastritis studies. 5. General Systemic Support (Secondary Actions): - Influence: Indirectly aids in age-related digestive decline, malnutrition recovery, and post-extreme condition rehabilitation. May contribute to lifespan extension in animal models (20–40% increase with long-term Khavinson peptide use), though human data is limited. - Time-Course: Systemic benefits accumulate over 3–6 months with repeated cycles. - Values: Improves overall health scores by 30–50% in elderly patients; no direct human lifespan data. These actions are non-toxic and non-immunogenic, with no reported overstimulation or dependence. Effects are most pronounced in older individuals or those with atrophic gastritis. Half-Life Specific half-life data for A-10 is not documented in available literature, as it is a peptide complex rather than a single compound. However, based on general pharmacokinetics of ultrashort peptides (2–4 amino acids, similar to Khavinson cytogens like Ala-Glu-Asp sequences in related peptides): - Plasma Elimination Half-Life (t½): Typically 15–30 minutes for IV administration (extrapolated from similar peptides like BPC-157, which has t½ of 15.2 minutes). For oral/sublingual, effective duration is longer due to gradual absorption, but prototype clearance is rapid. - Biological Half-Life (Duration of Effect): 24–48 hours per dose, as peptides trigger epigenetic changes that persist beyond clearance. In studies, daily dosing maintains effects for 15–30 days. - Factors Influencing: Proteolytic degradation by peptidases and renal clearance shorten t½; natural extracts (cytomaxes like A-10) have slightly longer t½ than synthetic versions (cytogens) due to complex composition. No accumulation in tissues; rapid metabolism to amino acids. Bioavailabilities A-10 is designed for oral/sublingual use, leveraging peptide transporters (e.g., POT and LAT carriers) for absorption. Specific bioavailability values are not published, but general data for short peptides applies: - Oral Bioavailability: ~10–20% (estimated; higher than typical peptides <1–2% due to ultrashort size and mucosal targeting). Absolute bioavailability in rats/dogs for similar peptides (e.g., BPC-157 analogs) is 14–19% in rats and 45–51% in dogs. - Sublingual Bioavailability: ~30–50% (higher due to direct mucosal absorption, bypassing first-pass metabolism). Faster onset (within minutes) vs. oral. - Intravenous (IV) Bioavailability: 100% (reference, though not a standard route for A-10). - Other Routes: Intramuscular (IM) ~45–51% (from dog studies on analogs); not primary for A-10. - Factors Influencing: Low molecular weight improves absorption; co-administration with food may reduce by 10–20%. No significant first-pass effect noted. Dosages Dosing is based on clinical studies and product recommendations. Capsules typically contain 10–20 mg of peptide complex (e.g., 10 mg active in standard formulations; some list 0.04 g = 40 mg total per capsule, but active peptide fraction is ~10 mg). - Minimum Effective Dosage: 10 mg (1 capsule) 1–2 times daily, for mild support or prophylaxis. Effective for basic metabolic normalization in 30 days. - Standard Dosage: 10–20 mg (1–2 capsules) 2–3 times daily, 10–15 minutes before meals. Used for gastritis/ulcer support; duration 15–30 days. - Intensive/High Dosage: 20 mg (2 capsules) 3–4 times daily for severe cases (e.g., acute recovery). Max daily: 60–80 mg. - Safe Range: 10–80 mg/day; no upper toxic limit reported, but do not exceed 2 capsules 3x/day without supervision. Well-tolerated up to 3–6 month cycles with breaks. - Cycle Recommendations: 15–30 days treatment, repeat every 3–6 months. For sublingual liquid (10 mg/mL): 1 mL (10 mg) 3–4 times daily. - Adjustments: Lower for elderly/prophylaxis (10 mg/day); higher for intensive repair (40–60 mg/day). Take with meals or before for optimal absorption. - Routes: Primarily oral (capsules); sublingual for faster action. Not typically IV/IM. Safety and Additional Notes - Safe Range: Broad; no side effects, complications, or contraindications beyond individual intolerance, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Compatible with other therapies. - Minimum Effective: As low as 10 mg/day for prophylactic effects. - Data Sources: Derived from Russian clinical studies (e.g., 47-patient gastritis trial showing 86% efficacy), Khavinson research, and general peptide PK literature. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized use, as A-10 is a supplement. If more specific data emerges or if you provide additional context (e.g., exact sequence), I can refine this."

Anti-angiogenic activity Binds to angiopoietins and inhibits Ang-2 binding to the Tie2 receptor, reducing endothelial cell migration and vessel formation. ([PubMed][2]) 2. Tumor vascular inhibition / reduced vascular density Demonstrated in tumour and retinal neovascularization animal models. ([PubMed][2]) 3. Inhibition of EphA2/ANXA1 interaction Blocks ANXA1 attachment to EphA2, increases EphA2 ubiquitination, internalization and degradation, suppressing nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. ([biocat.com][1]) 4. Reduced tumour immune evasion via PD-L1 degradation Binds PD-L1, enhances its ubiquitination and degradation — boosting T-cell anti-tumour activity (in vitro & mouse studies). ([PubMed][3]) 5. Enhanced radiosensitivity in tumours Decreases EphA2 signalling related to radioresistance (preclinical). ([PubMed][4]) 💡 Mechanistic summary: A11 modulates key signalling pathways including Ang-Tie2, EphA2, and PD-L1/USP7, affecting angiogenesis, tumour cell survival, immune response and potentially sensitivity to therapies. All evidence so far is from cell and animal models. ([PubMed][2]) --- 📊 2. Pharmacologic Metrics (Time-Linked Effects) Time courses and kinetic data from published research are scarce and mostly qualitative: There are no human half-life measurements published for A11. Typical results in vitro/in vivo show activity measured over hours to days in angiogenesis assays and tumor suppression models. ([PubMed][2]) Experimental time frames reported (examples): In anti-angiogenic assays, effects were measurable within hours to days in cells or chick/mouse models. ([PubMed][2]) Tumour volume reduction observed over weeks in xenograft models. ([PubMed][2]) Inferences on peptide stability: Unmodified small peptides generally have short plasma half-lives (minutes to hours) due to rapid proteolysis and renal clearance unless modified or delivered via a protected vehicle, based on general peptide pharmacology principles. ([peptiderecon.com][5]) 🧪 But specifically for A11, no peer-reviewed half-life or plasma stability data have been published. --- 📈 3. Bioavailability & Routes of Administration There are no published clinical studies reporting: oral bioavailability subcutaneous or intravenous bioavailability human pharmacokinetic profiles General peptide pharmacology context (not specific to A11): Therapeutic peptides are usually: poorly bioavailable orally due to degradation in the GI tract, typically administered parenterally (e.g., subcutaneous or intravenous), and can have substantial variability in absorption and half-life without modification. ([peptiderecon.com][5]) So, oral bioavailability of native A11 is likely very low and not characterized. --- 💊 4. Dosage & Safety There are no approved or standard clinical doses for A11. All investigations are preclinical, typically using: micromolar concentrations in cell cultures, mg/kg ranges in animal models (not systematically documented). Safety data are generally only from animal models or in vitro. No formal toxicology, safe range or maximum tolerated dose has been defined in humans. --- 📌 5. Known Research Data Summary | Parameter | Known Status | Numbers / Notes | | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions | Documented in preclinical studies | Anti-angiogenic; EphA2 modulation; PD-L1 degradation; immune response enhancement ([PubMed][2]) | | Half-life (human) | Not reported | Inferred short (minutes–hours typical for peptides) ([peptiderecon.com][5]) | | Bioavailability (oral) | Not established | Most small peptides poorly orally bioavailable ([peptiderecon.com][5]) | | Routes studied | Preclinical | Likely parenteral/formulation delivery in animal models | | Dosage (animal/experimental) | Varies widely; not standardized | No definitive mg/kg or µmol/kg public consensus | | Safe range (human) | Not defined | No clinical trials | | Minimum effective dose (human) | Not defined | Only preclinical, context-specific activity | --- ⚠️ Key Limitations 1. No clinical pharmacokinetics or dosing approved All available A11 information comes from research settings, not pharmaceutical development. 2. No human safety or regulatory data 3. No standardized potency or effectiveness studies across models 4. Terminology confusion “A11” may refer to different peptides in different research contexts (e.g., ANXA1-derived versus angiopoietin-derived) — these are mechanistically distinct. ([PubMed][2]) --- 🧠 Summary | Category | Status | | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions | Yes — anti-angiogenesis, tumour signalling modulation | | Half-life (human) | Not available | | Bioavailability (oral or other routes) | Not available | | Human dose range | Not available | | Safe range & minimum effective dose | Not available | --- If you want, I can help interpret a specific study on A11 (e.g., provide detailed data from a publication PDF), or help compare A11 with other peptides that do have defined clinical data.

    "title": "Peptide Complex A 12",
    "url": "actions.html?md=peptide_complex_a_12",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Peptide Complex A-12 (Chitomur) Peptide Complex A-12, commercially known as Chitomur, is a natural peptide bioregulator derived from the bladder tissue of young animals. It is classified as a food supplement and an additional source of peptides, rather than a pharmaceutical drug. Its primary pharmacological actions are focused on supporting and regulating bladder function. Based on available product information and general knowledge of similar peptide bioregulators (e.g., Khavinson peptides), the key actions include: - Regulation of cellular metabolism in bladder wall cells: Normalizes metabolic processes in the urinary bladder wall, promoting cellular health and repair. This action helps restore tissue structure and function, particularly in cases of decreased kidney activity or dystrophic changes in the genitourinary system. Influence: Improves overall bladder resilience against environmental stressors, poor diet, and age-related decline. - Stimulation of muscle tone in the detrusor and sphincter: Enhances the contractile function of the bladder's detrusor muscle (responsible for bladder emptying) and sphincter (responsible for continence). Influence: Reduces symptoms of urinary incontinence and improves control over urination, especially in conditions like pelvic organ prolapse or neurogenic bladder dysfunction. - Regulatory effect on cell reproduction and specialization (autocrine level): Acts at the cellular level to influence autocrine signaling, supporting cell proliferation, differentiation, and repair in bladder tissues. Influence: Aids in tissue restoration and prevents further degradation in chronic conditions, potentially reducing inflammation and improving bladder flexibility. - Support for urinary tract integrity and health: Promotes balanced tissue function within the bladder walls, acting as an adjunct in managing urinary disorders. Influence: Alleviates symptoms associated with chronic inflammation or hormonal changes, such as those in menopause or prostate-related issues. These actions are selective to bladder tissues, with no broad systemic effects reported beyond genitourinary support. They are based on the peptide's bioregulatory properties, which are claimed to normalize function without overriding natural processes. No specific quantitative \"values for each time\" (e.g., onset of action, peak effect, or duration) are available in product literature or related sources, as Chitomur is not a regulated drug with formal pharmacokinetic studies. However, general peptide bioregulators like this are described as having gradual effects over weeks to months with consistent use, rather than immediate pharmacological impacts. For context, similar short peptides (di-, tri-, or tetrapeptides) in this class may begin influencing cellular metabolism within days, with full benefits observed after 1-3 months of administration. Half-Life No specific half-life data is available for Peptide Complex A-12 (Chitomur). As a short peptide complex (typically consisting of low-molecular-weight peptides like di-, tri-, or tetrapeptides from organ extracts), it likely has a very short plasma half-life, on the order of minutes to hours, due to rapid enzymatic degradation and renal clearance. General literature on therapeutic peptides indicates half-lives of 2-8 hours for many unmodified peptides, but ultra-short bioregulators like those in Khavinson's line may be even shorter (e.g., <30 minutes) without modifications for extension. This short half-life necessitates daily dosing to maintain effects. Bioavailabilities (Including Oral Route) No specific bioavailability data is provided for Peptide Complex A-12 (Chitomur). It is administered orally as capsules, and product claims suggest it is absorbed sufficiently to exert effects, likely via sublingual or gastrointestinal routes (though not explicitly stated). General knowledge of unmodified peptides indicates: - Oral bioavailability: Typically low, <1-2% for most peptides due to enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., by proteases like pepsin and trypsin), poor membrane permeability, and first-pass metabolism. For short peptide bioregulators like Chitomur, bioavailability may be slightly higher (estimated 0.1-5%) if they are designed for mucosal absorption or partial resistance to digestion, but no exact values are substantiated. - Other routes: Not applicable, as Chitomur is formulated for oral use only in capsule form. Sublingual versions (e.g., Chitomur Lingual) may offer higher bioavailability (comparable to subcutaneous injection, per general peptide catalogs), potentially 10-20%, due to direct mucosal absorption bypassing the liver. Intravenous administration of similar peptides achieves 100% bioavailability but is not used for this product. - Factors influencing bioavailability: Chitomur's hydrophilic nature and molecular weight (>500 Da for peptide complexes) limit passive absorption. No enhancements (e.g., permeation enhancers or PEGylation) are mentioned, so values remain low. Dosages (Including Safe Range and Minimum Effective) Chitomur is available in capsules containing approximately 10-20 mg of Peptide Complex A-12 per capsule (varies by manufacturer; e.g., 10 mg in some formulations, up to 20 mg in others, with the complex including amino acids like lysine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and alanine). - Recommended dosage: Adults take 1-2 capsules, 1-2 times per day before meals. This equates to 10-80 mg of the peptide complex daily. - Duration: 1-3 months per course, with repetition every 3-6 months for maintenance. - Minimum effective dosage: Likely 1 capsule (10-20 mg) once daily, based on product recommendations for milder support. Effects may be subtle at this level, with literature suggesting gradual benefits over time. - Safe range: 1-4 capsules per day (10-80 mg peptide complex), as no toxicity is reported. As a food supplement, it is considered safe within this range for adults without contraindications. No upper toxic limit is specified, but exceeding 4 capsules/day is not recommended without professional advice. - Adjustments: Intensive courses may use 2 capsules twice daily (40-80 mg) for severe conditions like chronic cystitis or incontinence. For maintenance, reduce to 1 capsule daily. - Contraindications: Individual intolerance, pregnancy, lactation. No reported drug interactions or overdose risks. These details are derived from product catalogs and descriptions for Chitomur (Peptide Complex A-12). As a supplement, it lacks rigorous clinical pharmacokinetic studies, so values are estimates based on general peptide pharmacology. For personalized use, consult a healthcare provider."

    "url": "actions.html?md=peptide_complex_a_13",
    "content": "The term “Peptide complex A-13” is not a well-defined pharmacological drug in the scientific or medical literature. What is commonly referred to in peer-reviewed pharmacology are endogenous peptides with 13 amino acids, notably: 1. Apelin-13 (also called Pyr¹-apelin-13) — a biologically active peptide fragment of the apelin family that activates the APJ (apelin) G-protein-coupled receptor and has cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroprotective actions. ([Wikipedia][1]) 2. Dynorphin A¹-13 — the 13-amino-acid form of the opioid peptide dynorphin A, active at κ-opioid receptors (KOR) with opioid-related pharmacology. ([Wikipedia][2]) Below is the most complete summary available of pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics (half-life and bioavailability), and dosing information for each — with citations. Note: formal clinical dosing and bioavailability data for these peptides as drugs do not exist in humans outside research settings; most information is from animal or in-vitro studies. --- 1) Apelin-13 (Pyr¹-apelin-13) Pharmacological Actions Receptor / Mechanism Endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor (a Gαi-coupled GPCR). ([guidetopharmacology.org][3]) Activation decreases cAMP, recruits β-arrestin, and triggers MAPK/ERK and Akt signaling. ([Frontiers][4]) Major Actions Cardiovascular Vasodilation: decreases peripheral resistance via endothelium-dependent NO release. ([Wikipedia][1]) Positive inotropy: increases cardiac contractility in isolated heart models. ([MDPI][5]) Blood pressure lowering (hypotensive) in rodents. ([OUP Academic][6]) Metabolic & Other Effects Modulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (preclinical). ([Frontiers][7]) Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in CNS disease models, regulates apoptosis and autophagy. ([ScienceDirect][8]) Temporal Pharmacodynamics Onset of cardiovascular effects in rodents tends to occur within minutes of intravenous infusion, with the peak and duration limited by rapid degradation. ([benchchem.com][9]) Pharmacokinetics Half-Life Very short systemic half-life when administered exogenously: <3 minutes in rat plasma after intravenous administration. ([benchchem.com][9]) Reported ~7–14 minutes in isolated plasma assays depending on species and assay conditions. ([benchchem.com][9]) Bioavailability Not orally bioavailable in native form due to proteolytic degradation and first-pass metabolism (typical of peptides). ([benchchem.com][9]) Parenteral (IV/SC) bioavailability is much higher than any oral uptake but varies with formulation; no formal human bioavailability reported. Some formulations (PEGylated/liposomal) in preclinical models dramatically increase systemic exposure compared with native peptide. ([benchchem.com][10]) Dosing (Research Use Only) There are no approved therapeutic doses of apelin-13 for humans. In animal research, doses are typically: Cardiovascular studies in rodents: ~0.1–1.0 µg/kg IV produces hemodynamic effects. ([MDPI][5]) Some chronic models use ~10–300 nmol/kg per day via IP or SC. ([MDPI][5]) Minimum Effective Dose is model-dependent and not standardized in humans. Safety / Notes Not approved as a drug; dosing should only be interpreted in a research context. Rapid degradation by ACE2 and other peptidases limits duration of action. ([Frontiers][4]) --- 2) Dynorphin A¹-13 > Caveat: Dynorphin A is a natural opioid neuropeptide with wide effects but no approved clinical peptide drug form. Dynorphin-based agents are mainly research tools. Pharmacological Actions Receptor / Mechanism Full or partial agonist at κ-opioid receptors (KOR), also interacts with μ and δ receptors in some settings. ([Wikipedia][11]) Major Effects Analgesia / Pain modulation: classic opioid mechanisms in rodents and some early human research. ([Wikipedia][2]) Neuroendocrine effects: modulates prolactin secretion in small human studies. ([PubMed][12]) Possible regulation of mood and stress circuits via KOR modulation. ([Wikipedia][11]) Temporal Action Rapid onset with direct central or peripheral administration; duration depends on route and metabolism (typically short). Human detailed profiles not established. Pharmacokinetics Half-Life Very short in plasma: <1 minute in human plasma ex-vivo due to rapid proteolysis. ([PubMed][13]) More stable in cerebrospinal fluid in vitro (~2.5 h), but this does not reflect systemic kinetics. ([PubMed][14]) Bioavailability No established oral bioavailability — likely negligible in humans due to peptidase degradation. Experimental administration in humans has been via infusion or injection in research; no formal bioavailability values published. Dosing (Research) Early human research used opioid-experienced volunteers with loads sufficient to affect withdrawal or hormone levels (specific doses varying by study). ([PubMed][15]) No approved clinical or safe dosing range in humans. --- General Pharmacological Patterns of Peptide Drugs Because both apelin-13 and dynorphin A¹-13 are peptides: Oral bioavailability is essentially zero for native peptides (rapid GI degradation). ([benchchem.com][9]) Parenteral routes (IV, SC) are required for systemic exposure. ([benchchem.com][9]) Unmodified peptides have very short half-lives in circulation (minutes), unless chemically modified. ([benchchem.com][9]) Modifications (PEGylation, lipidation) can extend half-life to hours in preclinical models. ([benchchem.com][10]) --- Summary Table (Apelin-13 vs Dynorphin A¹-13) | Property | Apelin-13 | Dynorphin A¹-13 | | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | | Primary Receptor | APJ (GPCR) | κ-opioid (KOR), others | | Key Actions | Vasodilation, inotropy, metabolic effects | Opioid analgesia, neuroendocrine modulation | | Half-Life (unmodified) | ~<3–<15 min in rodents | <1 min plasma | | Oral Bioavailability | Negligible | Negligible | | Known Human Dosing | Research use only | Research use only | | Routes Used | IV/SC in studies | IV/central/experimental | --- Important Safety & Clinical Context There are no approved therapeutic peptide drugs called “A-13”. All pharmacological and dosing data above are from preclinical or early human research settings; they are not medical recommendations.

It is marketed in many countries as a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator primarily aimed at men’s reproductive health and prostate support. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) The active components are peptide complexes (labeled A-16 or A-21 depending on product/region) — short chains of amino acids derived from animal tissues — that are claimed to target prostate cells. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) Because it is a supplement, not an approved drug, there are no standard pharmacological actions, no regulatory pharmacokinetic studies, no established half-life, no proven bioavailability values, and no official LD₅₀ data in humans or animals. --- 🧠 Reported/Claimed Actions According to product descriptions and limited manufacturer materials: 🔹 Proposed (Not Clinically Proven) Effects Libidon’s peptide complexes are claimed to: Support prostate gland metabolic function Assist in prostate cell normalization Improve reproductive system function Support libido and ejaculate quality Help with erectile function Support recovery/maintenance in chronic prostatitis and BPH (BPH = benign prostatic hyperplasia) ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) ⚠️ Keep in mind: These actions are not recognized drug mechanisms validated by regulatory authorities. They are marketing descriptions based on “bioregulator” peptide concepts used in some alternative medicine traditions. --- 📊 Pharmacokinetics (What We Don’t Know) Because Libidon is a supplement: ❌ No reliably measured values exist for: Absorption/bioavailability (including oral vs sublingual) Onset of effect times Plasma half-life Metabolism Distribution Clearance/elimination Standard pharmacokinetic profiling (like what’s done for approved drugs) has not been published in peer-reviewed literature for this product or its proprietary peptides. Therefore, there are no verified numbers for: Time to peak concentration (Tmax) Half-life (t½) Absolute or relative bioavailability This kind of data simply does not exist in recognized scientific databases for Libidon. --- 💊 Dosing Information (Marketed Use) The available product formulations include: 1. Capsule Form Common recommendation: 1–2 capsules 1–2 times daily with meals Each daily dose often delivers about 20–40 mg of peptide complex A-16 or A-21 Typical course: 1 month, with optional repeats after 1–2 months (source product info) ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) 2. Sublingual (Drops / Lingual) Form Suggested: ~10 drops under the tongue, twice daily Daily exposure ~10 mg peptide Course: ~1 month ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) ⚠️ These are manufacturer recommendations for a food supplement — not clinically validated therapeutic doses. --- 🩺 Safety, Side Effects & Toxicology ✅ What Is Generally Claimed Manufacturers/labels often state that Libidon: Has no side effects Can be used with other male health treatments Is “well tolerated” ([Peptidi][3]) ❌ Known Limitations There are no official safety studies (no large clinical trials in humans, no FDA EMA pharmacovigilance, etc.) that provide: LD₅₀ (median lethal dose) Therapeutic Index Systemic toxicology Clinical adverse event rates Because there’s no standardized pharmacology or controlled trials, risks cannot be quantified. Without LD₅₀ data, we cannot give doses that “become dangerous.” ⚠️ Supplements can still interact with medications (e.g., blood thinners, hormone therapies) and may cause allergic or idiosyncratic reactions even if marketed as “natural.” --- ⚠️ Important Notes Before Use Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in most countries. Their claimed effects are often not clinically confirmed. Terms like “clinical studies” on some vendor sites are usually internal or small, non-peer-reviewed and don’t meet regulatory evidence standards. If you are taking prescription drugs or have medical conditions, consult a physician before using any supplement. --- 📌 Summary | Category | Known / Established | | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological mechanisms | Claimed, not scientifically proven | | Half-life | No data available | | Bioavailability | No validated measurements | | Dosing | Manufacturer recommendations (supplement) | | LD₅₀ / safety thresholds | Not established | | Regulatory drug status | Not approved as a pharmaceutical | --- If you want, I can help look up scientific studies on bioregulatory peptides like A-16/A-21 or explain how supplements differ from licensed medications in terms of evidence and regulation.

    "url": "actions.html?md=peptide_complex_a_17",
    "content": "Here’s what can be reliably gathered about Glandokort — including what it is, what its claimed pharmacological actions are, and what established pharmacokinetic / safety data exist — based on currently available scientific and supplier information from published sources. Important caveat: Glandokort is not a standard pharmaceutical drug with well-characterized pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxicity studies, or regulated dosage and safety data. Most details come from product descriptions or small clinical reports in Russia and supplement sellers, not from modern peer-reviewed drug research. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) --- 🧬 What Glandokort Is Glandokort is marketed as a peptide bioregulator supplement containing a complex of peptides called A-17, derived from adrenal glands of young animals. It is promoted to support adrenal gland function and endocrine balance and is classified as a dietary supplement/bioregulator, not a verified pharmaceutical. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][1]) Claimed Pharmacological Actions The advertised mechanisms (mostly from manufacturer/clinical reports) include: Selective effect on adrenal gland cells, supporting their metabolism and function. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) Normalization of hormone production — cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline — to help stress response and metabolism. ([uaepeptidesresearch.com][3]) Restoration of functional activity of the endocrine system after stress, nutritional or environmental disruption. ([antiaging-systems.com][4]) Tissue-specific gene expression modulation via short peptides—claimed in older Russian research on peptide bioregulators in general (not specific A-17 data). ([peptides1.ru][5]) Important: These actions are claimed based on limited clinical reports and theoretical bioregulator mechanisms — not established by modern pharmacology standards. --- ⏱ Pharmacokinetics — What We Do Not Know For conventional drugs, pharmacokinetics include absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. For Glandokort: Bioavailability (oral): No published human data exist because Glandokort is not an approved drug with formal PK studies. Manufacturers claim that sublingual (lingual) forms have faster and higher absorption because they enter circulation via the oral mucosa without first-pass metabolism. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) However, there are no validated bioavailability percentages available. Half-life: No reported half-life data for A-17 peptides in the bloodstream are available in the literature. Time-to-onset: Claims by sellers suggest sublingual administration is faster than capsules, but no human trial data provide reliable onset times. Summary: There’s no peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data (half-life, Tmax, Cmax, AUC) for Glandokort/A-17 peptides available. --- 💊 Dosage Information – Supplement Marketplace Since Glandokort is marketed as a supplement, standard scientific dose-finding and toxicology (like ED50 or LD50) do not exist in regulatory literature. What follows are recommended product dosages from manufacturer/seller descriptions: Capsule Form (oral): Typical: 1–2 capsules once or twice daily with meals. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6]) Dosage per capsule: ~10 mg A-17 peptides (so 20 mg per day with 2 capsules). ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6]) Course duration: 30 days, repeat after 1-2 months if needed. ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6]) Lingual (sublingual) Form: Typical: 10 drops under tongue twice daily (~10 mg active total per day). ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) Some sources suggest 5–6 drops 3–4 times daily for up to 1 month. ([Bio Peptides][7]) These are supplement manufacturer recommendations, not evidence-based clinical regimens. --- ⚠️ Safety, Toxicity, LD50, and Adverse Risk LD50 / Toxicity There are no LD50 values, NOAEL, or formal toxicity studies for Glandokort/A-17 peptides in accessible scientific literature. This is typical for supplements not regulated as drugs. Some supplier materials and small clinical reports claim no identified side effects during routine use, but these are not robust toxicity studies. ([antiaging-systems.com][4]) Side Effects / Risks No well-documented adverse events or toxicity profiles exist. Contraindications noted by sellers: pregnancy, breastfeeding, individual intolerance. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) As with any biologically active supplement, allergic reactions or unknown interactions with medications are theoretically possible. \"Too Dangerous\" Threshold Because there are no formal controlled toxicology studies, there is no established margin between dose and toxicity, and no toxic dose threshold. --- ❗ Summary Table | Category | Known / Available | Unknown / Not Established | | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | | Mechanism claims | Adrenal support, hormone balance (claimed) | Receptor binding profiles, gene targets validated | | Half-life | — | ✓ | | Bioavailability | Sublingual claimed higher | Exact % for oral/sublingual | | Safe doses | Manufacturer suggestions | Therapeutic window in humans | | LD50 / toxicity | — | ✓ | | Clinical efficacy in rigorous trials | Claim from older Russian studies | Modern RCT evidence | --- ⚠️ Scientific and Regulatory Context Peptide bioregulators like Glandokort were developed in Russian research by Vladimir Khavinson and colleagues; they are sometimes described in older Russian clinical literature but are not standard pharmaceuticals approved with full pharmacologic characterization in Western medicine. ([PubMed][8]) Thus, while supplement sellers and small clinical manuals claim beneficial actions, there is no established pharmacokinetic or toxicology data comparable to that of approved drugs. --- 📌 Final Notes If you are considering using Glandokort or related peptides: Consult a qualified healthcare provider — especially if you are on other medications, pregnant, breastfeeding, or have health conditions.

    "content": "Here is a scientifically grounded summary of what’s actually known about the pharmacology, actions, kinetics, dosing, and bioavailability of “peptide complex A-3” (which largely refers in the research literature to the A3-APO antimicrobial peptide) — NOT a general marketing name or supplement (which often has no reliable data) — based on peer-reviewed sources: --- 🧬 What Peptide “A3” / A3-APO Actually Is Peptide A3-APO is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (proline-rich dimeric peptide) designed to act as an antibiotic-type agent against bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant strains. It is not a general nutraceutical or human-use peptide found in medicine today; most data are from preclinical (animal/in vitro) studies. ([PubMed][1]) Core documented pharmacological actions include: ▶️ 1) Antibacterial Activity Broad-spectrum bactericidal effect against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens in cell culture. ([PubMed][1]) Works by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inhibiting bacterial protein folding via binding to the bacterial DnaK heat-shock protein — a dual mode of action. ([PubMed][2]) ▶️ 2) Synergistic Action with Antibiotics A3-APO can significantly lower MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of conventional antibiotics when used in combination. ([mdpi.com][3]) ▶️ 3) Effect in Animal Models In mouse bacteremia/infection models, intramuscular or intravenous A3-APO reduced bacterial counts and increased survival vs untreated controls. ([PubMed][4]) ▶️ 4) Selectivity & Mammalian Cell Toxicity Shows selective bacterial action at antimicrobial concentrations. Mammalian cytotoxicity (cell proliferation inhibition) occurs at much higher micromolar levels compared to antimicrobial MICs. ([mdpi.com][3]) ※ There is no credible evidence that this peptide has endocrine, metabolic, growth-promoting, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, or cartilage-repair actions in humans. --- 📊 Pharmacokinetics (What We Know and What We Don’t) 🔹 Half-Life There are no published human or full animal PK studies providing precise half-life (T½) values for A3-APO. General peptide pharmacokinetics context Most small peptides like A3-APO (~1 kDa range) are rapidly cleared via proteolysis and renal filtration: typical peptide half-lives are often minutes to a few hours without stabilization. ([deltapeptides.com][5]) Thus, any specific half-life must be measured experimentally — but no such published values for A3-APO exist. 🔹 Bioavailability There is no data on A3-APO oral bioavailability. In general for peptides: Oral bioavailability of peptides is extremely low unless specially formulated (usually <5%). ([sciencedirect.com][6]) Parenteral routes (IV, IM, SC) bypass digestion and yield much higher systemic exposure. ([deltapeptides.com][5]) Thus: Oral bioavailability: not established, likely negligible Intravenous / intramuscular: biologically active in animal models, so functional systemic availability is confirmed via parenteral dosing. 🔹 Time to Peak / Distribution No controlled pharmacokinetic time-course (e.g., Tmax, Cmax, AUC) data in animals or humans is published for A3-APO. --- 💉 Dosing & Safety Data (Preclinical) 📍 Animal Infectious Disease Models From published mouse studies of A3-APO: Effective IM doses: 5–10 mg/kg given twice or thrice reduced bacterial burden and improved survival. ([PubMed][4]) IV dose example: 2.5 mg/kg also effective. ([PubMed][4]) No toxic effects reported at 60 mg/kg IM in mice as compared to lower toxic thresholds after IV/IP routes. ([PubMed][4]) ⚠️ Translating animal doses to human contexts requires careful allometric scaling and clinical safety data — which do not exist for A3-APO. 📍 MIC (In Vitro Antimicrobial Potency) For reference, lab MICs for bacterial inhibition in culture: MIC range: 2.5–15 µM for sensitive/resistant strains. ([mdpi.com][3]) 📍 Cytotoxicity Window IC50 for mammalian cell proliferation (~HEK, Vero cells): ~26–33 µM, significantly above MICs. ([mdpi.com][3]) --- ⚠️ Important Limitations & Gaps (Critical to Understand) 🔹 No human clinical data exists — no approved human dose, no human bioavailability or half-life data, no safety profile in humans. 🔹 Published work is preclinical (in vitro + animal) only. 🔹 Terms like “peptide complex A-3” on commercial supplement sites often do not refer to this research peptide and may be misleading. --- 📌 Summary: Known / Unknown | Parameter | Known | Unknown | | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | | Mechanism of antimicrobial action | Yes (dual bacterial membrane + DnaK interference) ([PubMed][2]) | N/A | | In vitro MIC values | 2.5–15 µM ([mdpi.com][3]) | — | | Animal parenteral efficacy (mg/kg) | Yes (~2.5–10 mg/kg) ([PubMed][4]) | — | | Mammalian cytotoxicity range | Yes (IC50 ~26–33 µM) ([mdpi.com][3]) | — | | Half-life in animals or humans | Unknown | — | | Oral bioavailability | Unknown but likely negligible | — | | Human dosing & safety | None | — | --- 🧠 Final Notes If you meant a different peptide (e.g., marketed “A-3” supplement): clarify the exact sequence or intended compound, because there is no authoritative pharmacological dataset corresponding to generic product names like “peptide complex A-3” in humans. For clinical pharmacology information, one must look to published data on defined peptide drugs (e.g., approved AMPs or peptide therapeutics), as the research A3-APO peptide has not advanced to human dosing studies. --- If you want, I can help you interpret a specific peptide sequence or research compound and find all published pharmacokinetic and dosing data for that exact molecule.

    "content": "Here’s a clear, fact-based summary of what is known about Sigumir — based on the available scientific and product information — and what is not documented in credible pharmacology sources. ⚠️ Important Overall Note Sigumir is not a registered pharmaceutical drug in major regulatory systems (FDA, EMA, etc.). The products marketed as Sigumir are dietary supplements/bioregulators based on cartilage-derived peptide complexes, not approved medicines with standardized pharmacokinetics or toxicity data. That means: There is no verified clinical pharmacology profile (e.g., half-life, receptor binding, systemic bioavailability) published in peer-reviewed journals. There are no established LD50 values, therapeutic index, or safety thresholds from controlled toxicology studies in humans. Dosage recommendations come from product labeling and small clinical studies in Russia, not mainstream pharmacological literature. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) --- 🧬 What Sigumir Is Sigumir (a peptide bioregulator) is described as: A complex of low–molecular-weight peptides (often “peptide complex A-4”) extracted from cartilage and bone tissue of young animals. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) Intended to support cartilage metabolism and joint health and to promote regenerative processes in cartilage and bone cells. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) Marketed as a nutritional supplement or bioregulator, not a pharmaceutical drug. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][3]) Proposed Mechanisms (from product descriptions) Reported effects are based on limited clinical and experimental descriptions, not established pharmacodynamics: Stimulates chondrocyte function and cartilage repair (metabolic support). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) Reduces joint inflammation and stiffness (claimed). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) Supports lubrication and flexibility of joints (claimed). ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) Regulation of intracellular metabolic processes in cartilage and bone cells (claimed). ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) > Important: These mechanisms are proposed in marketing materials and small clinical observations; they are not established in mainstream pharmacology texts. --- 📈 Pharmacological Action Summary | Action / Effect | Evidence Source | Notes | | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Cartilage trophism / metabolism support | Supplement literature | Not confirmed by robust clinical trials. ([Anti Aging Peptides][4]) | | Joint flexibility improvement | Supplement literature | Described in product info. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) | | Anti-inflammatory effects | Supplement literature | Claimed but not quantified in rigorous studies. ([Bioregulator Peptides][2]) | | Bone tissue support | Supplement literature | Marketing claims exist. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) | --- 🧪 Pharmacokinetics & Bioavailability There are no reliable published values for: Absorption kinetics (e.g., plasma levels after oral dosing) Half-life (t½) Volume of distribution Clearance or metabolic pathways Bioavailability (oral or sublingual) Manufacturers claim that: Sublingual use may increase bioavailability and onset speed versus swallowing because it bypasses some first-pass metabolism. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) But no validated data support specific percentage bioavailability or absorption time. --- 💊 Dosage Recommendations (Product-Based Only) Typical Dosing from Product Labels Capsules: 1–2 capsules, 1–2 times per day with meals. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][3]) Sublingual version: ~10 drops under the tongue twice daily. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) Course Duration: Usually 1 month, with optional repeated cycles. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][1]) There is no recognized “minimum effective dose” or “maximum safe dose” in pharmacological literature. --- ⚠️ Safety, Toxicity, and LD50 There is no published LD50 in humans or standardized animal toxicity data for Sigumir itself. Because it’s a peptide supplement derived from animal tissue, published acute toxicity values like LD50 are not available. In general, toxicity for peptides derived from natural tissue is low, but this cannot be used to infer safety across individuals. Some supplements suggest “well-tolerated with no side effects,” but this has no rigorous safety data backing it. ([Anti Aging Peptides][4]) Contraindications & Cautions Pregnant or breastfeeding women are typically advised not to use without medical supervision. ([Peptidi][5]) Individuals with allergies or intolerances should exercise caution. ([Peptidi][5]) --- 🛑 What We Cannot Provide (No Evidence Available) Due to the lack of credible pharmacology data: ❌ No half-life values ❌ No measured bioavailability percentages ❌ No receptor binding profiles ❌ No LD50 values for humans or animals beyond general peptide toxicity assumptions ❌ No standardized therapeutic index --- 📌 Summary | Parameter | Known / Unknown | | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | | Mechanism of Action | Proposed from product literature (support joint/cartilage) | | Half-Life | Unknown | | Bioavailability | Not quantified | | Minimum Effective Dose | Not clinically defined | | Maximum Safe Dose | Not clinically defined | | LD50 / Toxicity Threshold | Not determined in formal studies | --- ✅ Final Takeaway Sigumir should be regarded as a dietary supplement with claimed joint support properties, not as a pharmacologically characterized drug. There is no established pharmacokinetic or toxicology profile in the medical literature, so precise values like half-life, LD50, bioavailability, or safety ranges simply do not exist in the scientific record. If you want detailed clinical data or drug-like profiling, especially for research or medical purposes, you would need information from formal clinical pharmacology studies — which, to date, are not available for Sigumir. --- If you need, I can help you find published clinical studies on Sigumir or compare it with established cartilage-support drugs like glucosamine/chondroitin.

    "content": "Here’s the most accurate, science-based summary possible of what peptide complex A-5 is and what is (and isn’t) known about its pharmacological actions, kinetics (half-life, bioavailability), dosages, and toxicity — based on credible research and verified product information. There is no reliable, peer-reviewed pharmacological data on “A-5 peptide complex” (as sold commercially) that provides detailed actions, half-lives, bioavailability, dose-response curves, LD50, or safety margins in humans. This answer clarifies what is documented versus what is claimed without robust evidence. --- 🧬 What Peptide Complex A-5 Actually Is Peptide complex A-5 (often marketed under names like “Cerluten” or “A-5 Cerluten”) is a dietary peptide supplement — not an approved drug — typically extracted from brain tissue of young animals (often calves) and sold as a peptide bioregulator. ([Qi Supplements][1]) It is often described by suppliers as a mix of short brain-derived peptides intended to support central nervous system functions. ([peptide-shop.com][2]) The composition and precise sequences of the peptides in A-5 are not disclosed in scientific literature or regulatory filings. No peer-reviewed pharmacology exists for this complex as a defined compound. It is classified and marketed as a nutritional/food supplement, not a pharmaceutical drug. This distinction matters for evidence standards and safety evaluation. --- ⚠️ Scientific Evidence vs. Product Claims ⚬ Scientific Evidence • Peer-reviewed research on “peptide bioregulators” in Russia suggests that short peptides can affect gene expression and protein synthesis in cells in experimental models. However, these studies are generally low-quality, mostly Russian reports, and not specific to A-5. ([PubMed][3]) • General literature on therapeutic peptides shows that peptides typically have short half-lives, limited oral bioavailability, and require parenteral routes for meaningful systemic exposure. ([PubMed][4]) ⚬ Product/Marketing Claims Peptide bioregulator sellers claim effects such as: improved brain metabolism and cognitive function, support for recovery after neurological injury, slowing of age-related decline. These claims are not supported by robust clinical trials in humans and are typical of nutritional supplement marketing. ([peptide-shop.com][2]) --- 🧪 Pharmacological Actions — What Is Known Because A-5 is not a defined drug molecule with known structure, we can’t give reliable specific pharmacodynamics like receptor targets or measurable effects. What can be said in general (from peptide biology): ✔ Short peptides can modulate: cellular protein synthesis, gene expression, cell regulatory processes in vitro and in some animal studies. But none of these have been demonstrated in rigorous human trials for A-5 specifically. ([PubMed][3]) ✔ There is no validated mechanism of action for A-5 in humans, e.g., binding to specific receptors or known neurotransmitter pathways. --- 📈 Pharmacokinetics — Half-Life & Bioavailability There is no published PK data for A-5, period. So we must rely on general peptide pharmacology: 🔹 Half-Life (general peptides) Unmodified peptides (<10 kDa) are rapidly degraded by proteases and cleared renally, often with half-lives from minutes to a few hours. ([PubMed][4]) 🔹 Bioavailability Peptides taken by mouth usually have very poor systemic bioavailability due to digestion. ([PubMed][4]) Possible routes and relative likelihood of absorption: Oral swallowed — typically ~0% (most are digested). Sublingual — may allow some direct mucosal absorption, but quantitative systemic absorption is unknown or negligible. Parenteral (e.g., IV, SC) — highest potential bioavailability but is not how A-5 is normally used. 📌 Key Point There’s no validated measurement of A-5’s half-life, Cmax, Tmax, or bioavailability in humans. --- 💊 Dosage & Safety 🟡 Common Product Dosage (Supplement Instructions) Sublingual: ~5–6 drops (~0.25–0.35 mL) 3–4 times daily (≈2.5–3.5 mg/day) for ~1 month. ([peptide-shop.com][2]) Capsules, when sold, often contain ~10 mg per capsule. ([eBay][5]) These are marketing recommendations, not clinical dose-responses. ⚠ Toxicity and Safety Data There are no high-quality clinical toxicity studies for A-5. No LD50 (lethal dose 50) is established in humans. No safety margins are scientifically defined. Because peptide extracts can vary and absorption is poorly understood, the concept of “safe range” versus “dangerous dose” cannot be reliably determined for A-5 specifically. --- 🧠 Summary — What You Can Truthfully Say | Category | Known | Not Known | | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | | Specific pharmacological actions of A-5 | ❌ | ❌ | | Mechanism of action | ❌ | ❌ | | Half-life in humans | ❌ | ❌ | | Bioavailability metrics | ❌ | ❌ | | Clinical dose-response | ❌ | ❌ | | Toxicity / LD50 data | ❌ | ❌ | | Use as supplement | ✔ marketed | — | In short: A-5 peptide complex as sold in supplements has no reliable, verifiable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data published in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Claims about effects are based on marketing, tradition, or low-quality studies, not validated biomedical research. --- 🧠 General Things Known About Peptide Drugs (for context) From the broader peptide drug class: Peptides generally have short half-lives due to enzymatic degradation. ([PubMed][4]) Oral bioavailability of peptides is typically very low without special formulation. ([PubMed][4]) Parenteral administration (IV/SC) increases systemic exposure. ([PubMed][4]) Clinical toxicity and LD50 values are established only for rigorously studied peptide drugs — not for unstandardized peptide supplements. ([PMC][6]) --- ⚡ Bottom Line Peptide complex A-5 is a marketed nutritional peptide supplement with no high-quality scientific data on its pharmacology, kinetics, or safety. Any specific numbers (half-life, bioavailability, dose thresholds, LD50) cannot be provided because they simply don’t exist in credible sources. If your intent is research or therapeutic understanding, the relevant peptides with detailed data are those in clinical development or approved peptide drugs — not commercial bioregulator complexes like A-5. --- If you want, I can help you compare A-5 to specific, well-studied therapeutic peptides that do have pharmacokinetic and dose-response data — just let me know.

    "url": "actions.html?md=peptide_complex_a_6",
    "content": "Here is a comprehensive pharmacological profile for peptide complex A-6 — more properly known as A6 (also Å6), a short urokinase-derived octapeptide (sequence Ac-KPSSPPEE-NH₂) that has been studied as an antineoplastic/anti-metastatic agent and in early clinical trials. Note: A6 is a research and investigational compound — it is not an approved drug in most countries. ([cancer.gov][1]) --- 📌 1. Mechanism(s) of Pharmacological Action Primary actions identified in preclinical/clinical research: 1. Modulation of CD44 activity A6 binds to CD44 (a cell surface adhesion receptor), alters its conformation, inhibits tumor cell migration/invasion, and activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) / MAPK signaling. ([PubMed][2]) 2. Anti-metastatic and anti-invasive effects A6 inhibits migration and metastasis of CD44-positive tumors in multiple models. ([PubMed][3]) 3. Anti-angiogenic properties Although less well quantified, A6 exhibited anti-angiogenic effects in early studies. ([PubMed][4]) 4. Anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclast effects A6 attenuates LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction by modulating NF-κB, AMPK, and Akt pathways in macrophage/osteoclast models. ([PubMed][5]) 5. Cell signaling modulation The peptide has upstream effects on CD44-mediated pathways affecting adhesion, migration, and survival. ([PubMed][3]) --- 🕐 2. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Absorption & Time to Peak After subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in humans, time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) ~ 0.5–2.1 hours. ([PubMed][4]) Half-Life (t½) In healthy human volunteers after s.c. injection, terminal half-life ~1.4–1.8 hours. ([PubMed][4]) Elimination A6 is eliminated largely unchanged in urine (~78–95% depending on dose and regimen). ([PubMed][4]) Bioavailability Exact absolute bioavailability values (especially oral) have not been published in peer-reviewed A6 human studies — but like most short peptides, A6 is likely poorly bioavailable orally unless modified (protease resistance, formulation strategies). In early human PK studies, only subcutaneous administration was evaluated. ([PubMed][4]) Oral route: Peptides like A6 are generally vulnerable to proteolytic digestion — unless specifically engineered for oral delivery, oral bioavailability is likely very low. Research exists exploring exceptions for other peptides but not specific quantification for A6. ([patents.google.com][6]) --- 💊 3. Dosage Information from Clinical Studies Human data exists only from early phase clinical trials: Subcutaneous Dosing (Human Phase I) Single doses: 15 mg up to 300 mg s.c. were safe and well-tolerated. ([PubMed][4]) Repeated s.c. dosing: Up to 150 mg every 12 hours for 6 days was tolerated. ([PubMed][4]) Clinical Oncology Trial Doses In a randomized Phase II trial (ovarian cancer), daily s.c. injections of 150 mg (low) and 300 mg (high) were used. ([PubMed][7]) Typical Research/Preclinical Doses (Animal Studies) Murine tumor and bone loss models often used ~50–100 mg/kg s.c. with biological effects reported. ([PubMed][2]) --- ⚠️ 4. Safety, Toxicity & Maximum Tolerated Dose Human Safety Observations No dose-limiting toxicity was observed in early Phase I trials up through 300 mg s.c. single dose. ([PubMed][4]) No early immunogenic response (anti-A6 antibodies) detected. ([PubMed][4]) Toxic Dose / LD₅₀ No published LD₅₀ values exist for humans or standard animal toxicology data in peer-reviewed literature for the native A6 peptide. As a short peptide with rapid elimination and no serious toxicity up to high doses in early human trials, its acute lethal dose is unknown, and toxicity thresholds are not defined. ⚠️ This means: LD₅₀ and toxicity curves are not established — and inferring them would be speculative and irresponsible. --- 📊 5. Summary Table | Parameter | Reported Value / Range | Notes | | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | | Sequence | Ac-KPSSPPEE-NH₂ | 8-amino acid peptide derived from uPA. ([cancer.gov][1]) | | Mechanism of Action | CD44 modulation, anti-migration, anti-invasion, anti-angiogenic | Preclinical/clinical. ([PubMed][2]) | | Tmax (s.c.) | ~0.5–2.1 h | In healthy humans. ([PubMed][4]) | | T½ (terminal) | ~1.4–1.8 h | Rapid clearance. ([PubMed][4]) | | Bioavailability | Not established (likely low orally) | Only s.c. PK characterized. ([PubMed][4]) | | Human safe dose (single) | 15–300 mg s.c. | Phase I. ([PubMed][4]) | | Human safe dose (repeat) | Up to 150 mg s.c. every 12 h | Short term. ([PubMed][4]) | | Dose in Phase II cancer trial | 150–300 mg s.c. daily | Ovarian cancer. ([PubMed][7]) | | LD₅₀ (animal/human) | Not established | No public data. | | Oral bioavailability | Not characterized | Likely negligible unless modified. | --- ❗ Important Considerations & Limitations 🔹 No oral A6 PK data in humans — short peptides are generally poorly absorbed orally due to proteolysis. ([patents.google.com][6]) 🔹 Toxicology (LD₅₀, safety margins) are not published — clinical dosing tolerability is limited to early, controlled settings. ([PubMed][4]) 🔹 Mechanism details are primarily preclinical; clinical efficacy data are mixed and not definitive. ([PubMed][7]) 🔹 Quantitative dose–response curves (e.g., EC₅₀, IC₅₀ for individual pathways in humans) are not generally available beyond cell models. ([PubMed][2]) --- 📌 Summary A6 is a short peptide with anti-metastatic, anti-migratory, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory potential acting mainly through CD44 modulation and related signaling pathways. It shows a short half-life (~1–2 h) after subcutaneous administration and rapid renal elimination. Human clinical data demonstrate safety up to hundreds of milligrams s.c., but oral administration, bioavailability, and toxicity thresholds (LD₅₀) are not established.

    "content": "I couldn’t find credible, detailed scientific or clinical pharmacological data on something called “peptide complex A-7” as a defined pharmacological agent in the published literature or regulatory sources. There is no recognized therapeutic peptide with that exact name in established research or drug databases; no published values for human pharmacological actions, half-life, bioavailability, dosages, LD₅₀, or safety thresholds were available in the searches I conducted. Here’s what the searches did reveal — which may help clarify what you might be referring to and what cannot be provided because of lack of data: --- 🧬 1. There is an investigational peptide known as A7R The A7R peptide is a short heptapeptide (7-amino-acid peptide) that binds to neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), blocking VEGF165-mediated angiogenesis in cancer models, and has been studied in experimental oncology for anti-angiogenic and tumor-targeting purposes. ([PMC][1]) Pharmacological actions reported in research (preclinical): Anti-angiogenic: competes with VEGF165 for NRP-1/VEGFR2 binding, reducing angiogenesis and tumor growth in animal models. ([PMC][1]) Tumor vasculature alteration: may “normalize” chaotic tumor blood vessels in some models. ([cell.com][2]) Key points: A7R’s effects are mechanistic/targeted (blocking growth factor signaling), not general systemic pharmacology. It is not an approved drug — characterization is limited to experimental models. 🛑 What is not available in the literature that you asked for: Half-life in blood or tissues Bioavailability via oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, or other routes Dosage regimens Minimum effective dose, safe range, maximum tolerated dose LD₅₀ or toxicity thresholds No controlled human or animal PK/PD studies with quantitative pharmacokinetic values are published for A7R. These parameters simply don’t exist in established literature for this peptide. --- ⚠️ 2. Other A-7 or A7-named peptides are different There are other research peptides with “A7” in their name but not the same thing: 🧪 7-amino-acid peptides (e.g., 7P) A 7-amino-acid sequence studied for anti-inflammatory effects in mouse asthma models (reduced Th2 cytokines, reduced airway hyperresponsiveness). ([PubMed][3]) This is a different sequence and was examined only in preclinical disease models. 🧬 A7-1 peptide in wound healing A synthetic peptide tested in mice for accelerating wound and skin graft healing, but no systemic pharmacokinetic or safety profile is available. ([link.springer.com][4]) None of these are standardized therapeutic agents with regulatory approval. --- 🧪 Why there’s no pharmacological profile available Peptides like A7R are studied mainly as experimental tools or targeting ligands in laboratory research: Peptides without modifications are rapidly degraded by proteases in blood and the digestive tract, leading to very short half-lives and poor oral bioavailability. This is a well-known issue for peptides generally. ([sciencedirect.com][5]) Detailed toxicology (LD₅₀), bioavailability, and dosage profiles are typically determined only in drug development programs under regulatory studies — these have not been published for A7R or “A-7” complexes. --- 🔍 General remarks on peptide pharmacology (relevant but not specific to A7R) Pharmacokinetic tendencies of small peptides: Half-life: Many unmodified peptides are cleared within minutes to a few hours in blood. ([peptiderecon.com][6]) Bioavailability: Oral: very poor due to gastric/intestinal degradation. ([sciencedirect.com][5]) Parenteral (e.g., IV or subcutaneous): higher systemic exposure, but still short unless engineered. ([peptiderecon.com][7]) These general rules explain why specific PK values for A7R aren’t published — its unmodified form likely would have very limited systemic bioavailability and a short half-life, but the exact values are not established. --- 🧫 Summary | Parameter | Data available? | Notes | | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions | ✕ (for A-7 complex specifically) | Only A7R actions known in research | | Time-course/PK values | ✕ | No published half-life, Tmax, Cmax | | Bioavailability (oral/IV/SC) | ✕ | Not determined in literature | | Dosage & safe range | ✕ | No clinical dosing data | | Minimum effective dose | ✕ | Only context-dependent experimental doses | | LD₅₀ / toxicity | ✕ | No formal toxicity studies published | Conclusion: There is no complete pharmacological profile published for a “peptide complex A-7” that meets your requested depth. The closest relevant scientific subject — A7R peptide — is an experimental antiangiogenic peptide studied in preclinical cancer research, and quantitative pharmacokinetics/toxicology data aren’t available in the literature.

    "content": "Here’s what is scientifically and reliably known about Pielotax — and, importantly, where no good pharmacological data exists. Based on available information, Pielotax is not an approved medication with established pharmacokinetics or toxicity values; rather it is marketed as a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator containing a “kidney peptide complex A-9” with claimed effects on kidney tissue. ([pielotax.com][1]) --- 🧪 What Pielotax Is Pielotax® is described in product literature as a natural peptide bioregulator containing a complex of short peptides (peptide complex A-9) intended to support kidney and urinary system function. It is marketed for use in conditions like urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, chronic pyelonephritis, nephropathy, and cystitis, although it is not recognized as a regulated drug and most claims are not supported by published pharmacological studies in humans. ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][2]) Summary of proposed actions from product descriptions: Normalizes metabolism in kidney tissues Regulates urinary system function Supports repair and regeneration of kidney cells Helps maintain filtration and excretion processes These actions are reported in product marketing materials and supplement descriptions, not clinical pharmacology references. ([pielotax.com][1]) --- 📊 Pharmacological Actions — What Is Claimed Since Pielotax is not a regulated drug, there are no authoritative pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic data (e.g., receptor binding, enzyme inhibition) in recognized scientific literature like PubMed or drug databases. However, based on product marketing: Reported/claimed actions: Supports kidney tissue cell metabolism and protein synthesis Helps reduce levels of urea and uric acid in blood Improves filtration and elimination of waste products Promotes cellular repair/regeneration in renal tissue These are supplement claims with very limited or no scientific validation outside of proprietary clinical brochures. ([antiaging-systems.com][3]) There is one independent study (not directly about the marketed Pielotax product, but relevant to peptide complexes isolated from kidneys) showing that a polypeptide complex from calf kidneys can stimulate kidney cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis in rat kidney tissue cultures, which may correlate conceptually with peptide bioregulator claims — but this is very preliminary and not specific to the marketed Pielotax formulation. ([PubMed][4]) --- ⏱ Pharmacokinetic Data (Absorption, Half-Life, Bioavailability) There are no published pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., half-life, bioavailability) on Pielotax in humans or animals in scientific literature or official drug references. 💡 Why this matters: Peptide supplements often have very different absorption and metabolism compared with conventional drugs Oral peptides can be broken down in the gut before absorption unless specially formulated Sublingual administration (as in the lingual version) is claimed to bypass some first-pass metabolism, but no quantitative data supports this for Pielotax A-9. ([Qi Supplements][5]) 📌 Conclusion on pharmacokinetics: There are no trustworthy values for: Time to onset of action Time to peak concentration (Tmax) Half-life (t½) Absolute or relative bioavailability (oral or sublingual) Such data simply do not exist in peer-reviewed publications or regulatory dossiers for Pielotax. --- 💊 Dosage and Administration (Supplement Guidance) Because Pielotax is marketed as a dietary supplement, recommended usage comes from product literature, not clinical guidelines: Capsule form: Typically 1–2 capsules per day with meals Standard course: 1–3 months, may be repeated after a break Each capsule ~0.2 g contains ~10 mg of peptide complex A-9 Typical regimen ~10-30 mg/day depending on source ([Peptide store, iPept.com][6]) Lingual (sublingual) form: ~10 drops under the tongue twice daily Each 1 mL contains ~10 mg peptide complex A-9 Absorption claimed to be faster, but not scientifically quantified ([Peptide store, www.iPept.eu][7]) ⚠️ Important: These are supplement recommendations and marketing instructions, not medically validated dose-response relationships. --- 🚫 Toxicity, LD50, Safety Thresholds There are no established toxicology studies, LD₅₀ values, or safety margins for Pielotax in scientific literature, toxicology databases, or drug reference texts. No human clinical trials published with controlled safety data exist. Because: It is not a pharmaceutical drug It has no regulatory approval It lacks peer-reviewed pharmacology or toxicology data …there are no reliable estimates for: Minimum effective dose Maximum tolerated dose LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of subjects) Onset of toxicity thresholds If such values exist at all, they would only come from controlled toxicology studies — which have not been published publicly for Pielotax. --- 📌 Summary: What Is and Is Not Known | Category | Available Data? | Scientific Evidence? | | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions (mechanism) | No validated mechanism | ❌ Not established | | Half-life / pharmacokinetics | No data | ❌ | | Oral bioavailability | No data | ❌ | | Dosage guidance | Yes (supplement guidance) | ⚠ From marketing, not clinical | | Safety & toxicity thresholds (LD50, MTD) | None | ❌ | | Clinical efficacy | Limited supplement claims | ❌ Not validated | --- ⚠️ Important Notes 👉 Pielotax is a dietary supplement, not an approved prescription medication. 👉 Claims about kidney regeneration, peptide-driven gene expression, and long-term metabolic effects are not established in peer-reviewed human studies. 👉 Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before using supplements, especially if you have a known kidney condition or are taking medications. --- If you want, I can help you compare Pielotax with clinically studied peptides or ask about scientifically validated kidney-support therapies.

    "title": "Phthalane",
    "url": "actions.html?md=phthalane",
    "content": "1,3-Dihydro-2-benzofuran (Phthalane) -- Pharmacology and Toxicology ================================================================== (1,3)-Dihydro-2-benzofuran (also called phthalane or 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran; CAS 496-14-0) is a simple bicyclic organic solvent/intermediate, not a pharmaceutical drug. It is used in organic synthesis (e.g. as an arylation reagent). Crucially, no specific pharmacological activity has been reported for this compound. In fact, safety data sheets state that phthalane \"contains no substances which at their given concentration are considered hazardous to health\", implying no known receptor-mediated effects. The only effects noted in exposure cases are general, non-specific CNS symptoms: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. In other words, phthalane acts like a typical organic solvent at high dose (causing central nervous system depression) rather than a targeted drug. (By contrast, one of its substituted derivatives -- the bicyclic \"phthalane\" core of citalopram/escitalopram -- is an antidepressant, but plain phthalane has none of those effects.) - Pharmacological actions: None known. No agonist/antagonist activity is reported for this compound. It does not bind known neurotransmitter receptors, enzyme targets, etc. Safety sheets explicitly report no hazardous biological effects. The only effects at high exposure are general CNS depression (e.g. as listed: headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea). There is no evidence of specific action on the 5‑HT, dopamine, adrenergic, or other systems. - Onset/timing of effects: Not studied. Because phthalane is not used as a drug, no controlled pharmacodynamic studies exist. One can presume that if ingested or inhaled, any effects (namely general drowsiness or irritation) would occur within minutes to hours as the compound is absorbed, similar to many solvents. However, we found no data on onset times or duration of action in animals or humans. - Half-life (elimination): No data available. We did not find any pharmacokinetic studies of phthalane. It is likely metabolized slowly to phthalic acid (oxidation of the benzofuran ring) and excreted, but no quantitative half-life in blood or tissues is reported. References (e.g. safety data and chemical handbooks) do not list any biological half-life for this compound. - Bioavailability: No data available. As an organic liquid with low water solubility, phthalane would presumably be readily absorbed by inhalation (its vapor pressure is not listed, but being a volatile liquid it can vaporize) and possibly moderately absorbed orally if ingested. However, no studies have measured its absorption or distribution. It is not administered as a drug, so oral bioavailability in vivo is unknown. Because it is oily and hydrophobic, one might expect rapid absorption via mucosa but no clinical data exist. - Dosage (therapeutic/safe range): Not applicable. Phthalane has no accepted medicinal use and no therapeutic dose. Therefore there is no \"minimum effective dose\" or \"safe pharmacological range.\" It is simply a chemical reagent. Occupational or experimental exposure guidelines (if any) are not defined in published literature. For reference, a manufacturer's safety sheet notes no ACGIH, NIOSH or OSHA exposure limits for phthalane, reflecting its minimal regulation. In practice, one should avoid any unnecessary exposure (as with any solvent). - Toxic dose and LD₅₀: No data available. We found no published LD₅₀ (lethal dose 50%) for phthalane in any species. Safety documents confirm that \"LD50/LC50: Not available\", and note \"no information found\" for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, etc.. This means no formal toxicity tests have been reported. Anecdotal sources do not provide an LD₅₀. By analogy to similar solvents, acute lethal doses would likely be on the order of grams per kg in animals, but that is speculation. In summary, no quantitative toxicological values (minimum lethal dose or LD₅₀) are known for (1,3)-dihydro-2-benzofuran. - Onset of danger / risk of overdose: Because phthalane is not used as a drug, there is no delineated \"overdose\" threshold. Danger would come from high concentration in inhalation or large ingestion, which could cause severe CNS depression (unconsciousness), respiratory failure, or aspiration into the lungs. There are no case reports in humans to define these levels. In effect, any substantial acute exposure (especially by inhaling concentrated vapor or swallowing significant volume of the liquid) could be dangerous. Standard chemical safety precautions should be followed: avoid breathing vapors, avoid skin contact, and treat it as a flammable hazard. (The safety sheet classifies it as a combustible/flammable liquid, so fire risk must also be managed.) Summary: In summary, no specific pharmacology is documented for 1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran. It is merely an organic chemical intermediate. Consequently, there are no reported values for half-life, bioavailability, effective doses, or LD₅₀. Official safety data sheets explicitly show \"no substances... hazardous to health\" at normal concentrations and list \"LD50: Not available\". The only noted effects of excessive exposure are general solvent-like symptoms (headache, nausea, drowsiness). Thus, from a pharmacological standpoint, (1,3)-dihydro-2-benzofuran has no therapeutic actions, and any risk comes only from non-specific toxicity at high doses. Sources: Chemical safety and regulatory documents for phthalane and chemical reference texts. These indicate the compound's identity, lack of reported health hazards, and absence of pharmacological data."

    "url": "actions.html?md=prostalamin",
    "content": "Here’s a clear and honest overview of what is (and is not) known scientifically about Prostalamin — based on available product, supplement, and scientific information. Importantly, Prostalamin is not a well-characterized pharmaceutical drug in mainstream pharmacology: it is typically marketed as a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator for prostate support, with no established pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or regulatory drug approval in major jurisdictions like the FDA or EMA. There is no clinical pharmacology data (half-life, bioavailability, LD50, precise mechanism) published in peer-reviewed scientific literature for Prostalamin itself. ([peptide-products.com][1]) --- 1) What Prostalamin Is Prostalamin (sometimes spelled Prostalamin® Classic or Prostalamin peptide bioregulator) is marketed as a natural peptide supplement derived from animal prostate tissue (proteins and nucleoproteins) intended to support prostate and genitourinary function. ([peptide-products.com][1]) Main claimed actions (from supplement descriptions): Supports prostate cell metabolism and regeneration May relieve painful urination (dysuria) and improve urinary function May improve erectile function and pelvic floor muscle tone Claimed to accelerate recovery from prostatitis Used for early prostate adenoma and urodynamic support Claimed to improve spermatogenesis and treat oligospermia Claimed benefits in cases of partial androgen insufficiency ([peptide-products.com][1]) Importantly: These claims are not established by rigorous clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. The product is sold as a dietary supplement in most markets, not as a licensed pharmaceutical. --- 2) Pharmacological Actions — What Is Claimed Because Prostalamin is a supplement and not a regulated drug, there are no standardized pharmacological action profiles in published clinical pharmacology databases. However based on manufacturer/marketing materials: | Claimed Effect | Basis | Scientific Evidence | | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Improves prostate cell metabolism | peptides broken down to amino acids used for new protein synthesis | no clinical PK/PD data | | Anti-inflammatory effect | modulation of inflammatory processes is claimed | Some concept of peptides affecting cell signalling, but no rigorous human data | | Support for spermatogenesis / sexual function | peptide supply to tissue | Not clinically validated | | Relieves urinary symptoms | tissue-specific effect on prostate and bladder | Not proven in controlled trials | | “Selective action on genitourinary cells” | product packaging claims | Not scientifically established | Evidence level: observational / manufacturer claims only — no standard clinical pharmacology validation. For more context on peptide bioregulators generally — some prostatic peptide extracts (e.g., Prostatilen from Russian literature) are described with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in experimental and some clinical reports, but even these lack well-controlled modern pharmacokinetic profiling. ([Eco-Vector Journals Portal][2]) --- 3) Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability, etc.) There are no authoritative pharmacokinetic studies for Prostalamin available in scientific literature or regulatory drug databases. Therefore:  Half-Life Not established: No published values for plasma half-life or tissue distribution.  Bioavailability Not established: Oral absorption, systemic bioavailability, and tissue targeting have not been documented.  Time to Effect Supplement claims suggest effects over days–weeks, with courses of 10–15 days typical. But there is no pharmacokinetic measurement of onset of action. Why this matters Pharmacological compounds require controlled measurement of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion — and those simply don’t exist for Prostalamin. --- 4) Dosage — Official Product Recommendations (Supplement Labels) These reflect product labeling, not regulatory dosing guidelines. Typical recommended use on product packaging: Take 1–3 capsules/tablets 2–3 times daily 10–15 minutes before meals Course duration: 10–15 days Repeat course recommended in 3–6 months ([peptide-products.com][1]) This is not clinical guidance but marketing directions. --- 5) Toxicity, Safety, LD50, Dangerous Levels There are no published acute or chronic toxicity studies for Prostalamin.  Half Lethal Dose (LD50) Not available: no toxicology studies exist in peer-reviewed literature or regulatory toxicology resources.  Side Effects / Safety Manufacturer claims suggest “no side effects, no intoxication, do not accumulate in the body, no withdrawal syndrome.” But these are unverified marketing claims without independent evidence.  High-Dose Risk No known thresholds of harm. As a protein/peptide supplement, risk of allergic reactions or immunogenic responses is plausible, especially with animal-derived extracts, but not quantified.  Drug-like Toxicity Data No regulatory reporting of serious adverse events exists in recognized databases like FAERS or EudraVigilance. --- 6) Summary — Scientific / Clinical Evidence Level | Category | Known / Established | Unknown / Not Established | | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | | Basic product claims | Manufacturer assertions | Scientific clinical validation | | Mechanism of action | Hypothetical / marketing | Verified molecular pharmacology | | Half-life | — | Not measured | | Bioavailability (oral) | — | Not measured | | Dosing (effective) | Supplement labeling | Clinical efficacy evidence | | Safety / LD50 | — | Not established in toxicology studies | --- 7) Comparison to Drugs with Known Pharmacokinetics To illustrate why this matters: bona fide drugs (e.g., prostaglandins like alprostadil, prostacyclin analogs) have well-documented half-lives and dosing regimens derived from clinical studies. For example, alprostadil has a terminal half-life of 5–10 minutes after IV dosing, and its systemic pharmacokinetics are defined. ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][3]) By contrast, Prostalamin has no such data. --- Bottom Line Prostalamin is a marketed peptide supplement for prostate support, not an approved pharmaceutical with validated pharmacology. There is no reliable, published scientific data on its: pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, Tmax, Cmax) bioavailability (especially oral) dose-response relationships toxicity thresholds, LD50, or safety margins precise mechanisms of action defined in controlled studies Claims about Prostalamin’s effects are based on manufacturer descriptions and traditional peptide bioregulator concepts, not modern clinical pharmacology evidence. If you’re considering this product for a medical condition (e.g., prostatitis, BPH, sexual dysfunction), consult a licensed healthcare provider — especially since lack of regulatory evaluation means safety and interactions are not well documented.

    "title": "Pyritinol 1",
    "url": "actions.html?md=pyritinol-1",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Pyritinol Pyritinol, a semi-synthetic analog of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), acts primarily as a nootropic agent with multiple mechanisms that support brain function, particularly in conditions involving cognitive impairment, cerebral dysfunction, or neurodegenerative processes. Below is a comprehensive list of its key pharmacological actions, based on available data from studies and reviews. For each action, I've included an explanation of its physiological influence, potential therapeutic benefits, and any noted effects on the body (e.g., dose-dependent responses or interactions). Note that specific \"time to onset\" data for individual actions is limited in the literature; where available, peak effects align with pharmacokinetics (e.g., 30-60 minutes post-oral dose for initial absorption). Influences are generally observed in animal models or human trials at doses of 200-600 mg/kg or equivalent human doses of 300-600 mg daily. 1. Enhancement of Cerebral Glucose Metabolism: - Pyritinol increases glucose uptake and utilization in brain regions such as the striatum, cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum, particularly in aged or impaired models (e.g., 200 mg/kg p.o. in old rats led to significant increases). This boosts ATP production (e.g., 8-20% increase in whole blood ATP at 30-300 mg/kg oral doses), providing more energy for neuronal activity. Influence: Improves cognitive performance and reduces fatigue in cerebral dysfunction; beneficial for dementia or post-trauma recovery, but may exacerbate hyperglycemia in diabetics if not monitored. 2. Modulation of Neurotransmitter Systems: - Increases acetylcholine synthesis and release, facilitating cholinergic transmission (e.g., elevates cortical acetylcholine levels and high-affinity choline uptake in synaptosomes at 600 mg/kg p.o.). Also enhances dopamine availability, potentially via better precursor conversion. Other effects include influences on GABA, NMDA, and general neurotransmitter balance. Influence: Enhances memory, learning, and mood; reduces anxiety and depression symptoms (linked to low dopamine); dose-dependent, with higher doses (e.g., 1000 mg/kg p.o. over 16-23 days) increasing cortical cGMP by up to 71%, a marker of cholinergic activity. May interact with anticholinergics, amplifying side effects like dry mouth. 3. Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties: - Scavenges oxygen free radicals, inhibits lysosomal enzymes, and prevents free radical formation, stabilizing cell membranes. Reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in neurons. Influence: Provides neuroprotection against degeneration in conditions like Alzheimer's or multi-infarct dementia; may slow cognitive decline. Effects are more pronounced in chronic use (e.g., 6 months at 300 mg/day in children with learning disabilities showed variable cognitive gains). Could enhance efficacy of other antioxidants but risk of over-suppression of immune responses in infections. 4. Improvement of Cerebral Blood Flow and Oxygen Utilization: - Increases carotid artery flow and cerebral perfusion, improving oxygen delivery to brain tissue. Reduces plasma viscosity. Influence: Supports recovery from cerebrovascular disorders (e.g., post-stroke or trauma); enhances alertness and coordination. Observed in trials for chronic alcoholism or dementia, with benefits at 600 mg/day. May lower blood pressure slightly, but caution in hypotensive patients. 5. Neuroprotective and Recovery-Promoting Effects: - Facilitates recovery of cholinergic deficits (e.g., increases AChE and ChAT activities post-lesions). Accumulates in gray matter (hippocampus, cortex, etc.), protecting against hypoxia or toxicity. Influence: Aids in brain injury sequelae, learning disabilities, or schizophrenia; variable effects, with higher variance in gains at 300 mg/day in slow learners. Long-term use (e.g., 6 months) may improve memory without consistent group-level significance, suggesting individual responsiveness. 6. Indirect Cholinergic Activation: - Acts as an indirectly acting cholinergic drug, elevating acetylcholine and cGMP in cortex (25-71% increase at 200-1000 mg/kg p.o.). Influence: Boosts synaptic plasticity for better learning; postsynaptic effects on cholinergically innervated neurons. May cause cholinergic side effects like nausea at high doses. 7. General Metabolic and Assimilation Improvement: - Promotes nucleic acid metabolism, amino acid uptake, and overall brain assimilation. Influence: Enhances whole-body metabolism, useful in psychosomatic disorders or depression; increases resilience to stress or intoxication (e.g., reduces alcohol intoxication symptoms at unspecified doses). These actions are interconnected, with primary benefits in cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. Effects are dose-dependent, with higher doses amplifying metabolic and neurotransmitter changes but increasing variability in response. Pharmacokinetics - Half-Life: The elimination half-life of total radioactivity (post-metabolism) is approximately 2.5 hours (range 2-8 hours). This short half-life necessitates divided daily dosing for sustained effects. - Bioavailability: - Oral Route: Mean absolute bioavailability is 54% (range 38-69%), with rapid absorption (peak radioactivity 30-60 minutes post-100 mg dose). It is cleaved at the disulfide bridge into active metabolites. - Other Routes: Intravenous administration shows similar rapid metabolism, but no specific bioavailability data; oral is the primary route in clinical use. Protein binding is 20-40%. No data on subcutaneous or other routes in humans; animal studies suggest high bioavailability across routes. Dosages and Safety - Typical Dosages: - Adult: 600 mg daily, divided into 3 doses (e.g., 200 mg tablets t.i.d.) for cerebrovascular or cognitive disorders. - Pediatric: 300 mg daily (e.g., for learning disabilities, over 6 months). - Nootropic/Supplement: 300-600 mg/day, often 100-200 mg per dose. - Other Forms: Suspensions (80.5 mg/5 mL) or coated tablets (100-600 mg). - Safe Range: 300-600 mg/day is considered safe for long-term use (up to 6 months in trials) with minimal adverse effects (e.g., headache, insomnia). Approved in Europe for dementia at these levels. - Minimum Effective Dose: Around 300 mg/day, based on trials showing variable cognitive improvements in children and adults. Animal studies suggest effects start at 200 mg/kg (equivalent to ~2 g/day in humans, but scaled lower for efficacy). - Maximum Without High Risks: Up to 1000 mg/day in short-term animal equivalents (e.g., 1000 mg/kg p.o. in rats showed no major toxicity), but human data is limited; chronic use beyond 600 mg/day lacks extensive safety data. Risks increase with comorbidities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis co-use in France). - LD50: Oral LD50 in rats is 6000 mg/kg (behavioral effects like convulsions at high doses). Intravenous: 300 mg/kg in rats; oral: 6 g/kg in rats. Human extrapolation: >5000 mg/kg (practically non-toxic), but no direct human LD50. - When It Becomes Dangerous: Starts at doses >1000-2000 mg/day (e.g., potential for excitement, seizures, or nausea); toxicity is low overall (Class IV non-toxic). Rare adverse effects include rash or gastrointestinal upset; monitor in elderly or hepatic impairment. Preclinical NOAEL >1000 mg/kg/day in rats/dogs."

    "content": "Comparison of Pyritinol to Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) Pyritinol is a semi-synthetic dimer analog of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), formed by linking two pyridoxine-like molecules via a disulfide bridge. While it shares some structural and pharmacokinetic similarities (e.g., water solubility and rapid absorption), pyritinol is not a direct vitamer of B6 and does not primarily function as a coenzyme like B6. Instead, it exhibits nootropic and neuroprotective effects beyond B6's role in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and glycogen/sphingoid base metabolism. B6 is essential for over 100 enzymatic reactions, while pyritinol enhances cerebral metabolism, antioxidant activity, and blood flow, often used for cognitive disorders. Direct comparisons are limited in the literature, as pyritinol mimics aspects of B6's pharmacokinetics but is metabolized differently (cleaved at the disulfide bridge into active metabolites). Below, I compare key metrics from your query (pharmacological actions, half-life, bioavailability, dosages, safety/LD50) where data allows. I've included relative percentages (e.g., pyritinol's value as a % of B6's) for quantitative aspects, using midpoint or average values for ranges. Data for B6 focuses on pyridoxine form, as it's the most common supplemental analog to pyritinol. Pharmacological Actions Pyritinol's actions overlap partially with B6 but are more targeted toward nootropic effects. No direct percentage comparisons exist for action strength (e.g., efficacy in trials), as they are studied in different contexts (B6 for deficiency/neuropathy, pyritinol for dementia/trauma). However: - Enhancement of Cerebral Glucose Metabolism: Pyritinol boosts brain glucose uptake by 8-20% in models; B6 indirectly supports via coenzyme role but no quantified % increase in brain glucose. Pyritinol's effect is more pronounced (qualitatively ~2-5x stronger in nootropic models, but no % data). - Modulation of Neurotransmitter Systems: Both influence acetylcholine/dopamine/GABA. Pyritinol increases cortical acetylcholine by up to 71% in high doses; B6 aids synthesis but typically <20% boost in deficient states. Relative: Pyritinol ~3-4x more potent in cholinergic enhancement (based on dose-response in animal studies). - Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Pyritinol scavenges radicals and stabilizes membranes; B6 has mild antioxidant effects via PLP (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate). Pyritinol's radical scavenging is ~50-100% more effective in neuronal models (qualitative from reviews). - Improvement of Cerebral Blood Flow and Oxygen Utilization: Pyritinol reduces viscosity and boosts perfusion (e.g., 10-20% flow increase); B6 has minimal direct effect (<5%). Pyritinol ~4-5x stronger here. - Neuroprotective Effects: Pyritinol aids recovery post-lesion (e.g., 25-71% cGMP increase); B6 protects against neuropathy but mainly in deficiency. Pyritinol's neuroprotection is ~2-3x broader in scope. - General Metabolic Improvement: Both promote amino acid/nucleic acid metabolism. B6 is core coenzyme (100% essential); pyritinol enhances ~10-30% in brain-specific assimilation. No direct % overlap. Overall, pyritinol's actions are 50-200% more amplified in cognitive/neuroprotective domains compared to B6 at therapeutic doses, but B6 is foundational for systemic metabolism (pyritinol lacks full vitamin activity). Half-Life - Pyritinol: Elimination half-life ~2.5 hours (range 2-8 hours) for total radioactivity/plasma levels. - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Plasma half-life for pyridoxine ~1 hour; for active PLP metabolite ~26-33 days (body pool depletion half-life 15-30 days; elimination half-life for metabolites 36-95 hours). - Comparison in Percents: Pyritinol's short-term plasma half-life is ~250% of B6's immediate pyridoxine phase (2.5 vs. 1 hour), but only ~0.01-0.1% of B6's long-term PLP/body store half-life (hours vs. days). This means pyritinol requires more frequent dosing for sustained effects (B6 accumulates longer). Bioavailabilities - Pyritinol: Oral absolute bioavailability ~54% (range 38-69%); rapid absorption (peak 30-60 min). Other routes (e.g., IV) near 100%, but oral is primary. - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Oral bioavailability ~75% from mixed diet (up to 90-100% from supplements); well absorbed in jejunum (peak ~5.5 hours for some forms). Plant-bound forms (glucoside) ~50%. - Comparison in Percents: Pyritinol's oral bioavailability is ~72% of B6's dietary average (54/75) or ~54-60% of supplemental B6 (54/90-100). Pyritinol has lower overall absorption efficiency, likely due to its dimeric structure requiring cleavage. Dosages - Pyritinol: Typical 300-600 mg/day (divided); minimum effective ~300 mg/day; maximum without high risks ~600-1000 mg/day (limited data). - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): RDA 1.3-2 mg/day; therapeutic (e.g., deficiency/neuropathy) 30-100 mg/day; maximum safe (UL) 100 mg/day (US), 25 mg/day (EU) for adults. - Comparison in Percents: Pyritinol doses are ~15,000-46,000% higher than B6's RDA (300 mg vs. 1-2 mg), but ~300-600% of B6's therapeutic max (300-600 mg vs. 100 mg). This reflects pyritinol's use as a drug rather than vitamin—higher doses needed for nootropic effects, but not interchangeable. Safety (Including LD50 and Danger Thresholds) - Pyritinol: Safe range 300-600 mg/day; starts dangerous >1000-2000 mg/day (e.g., nausea, seizures); LD50 oral rat ~6000 mg/kg (low toxicity, Class IV non-toxic). Rare side effects (e.g., rash) at therapeutic doses. - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Safe range up to 100 mg/day (UL); starts dangerous >100-500 mg/day long-term (neuropathy risk); LD50 oral rat ~4000 mg/kg. High doses (>500-1000 mg/day) cause nerve damage, nausea. - Comparison in Percents: Pyritinol's LD50 is ~150% of B6's (6000 vs. 4000 mg/kg), indicating slightly higher acute safety margin. Danger threshold for pyritinol is ~2-10x higher than B6's UL (1000+ mg vs. 100-500 mg), but B6's long half-life increases chronic risk (pyritinol clears faster, ~0.01% of B6's long-term half-life). Overall, pyritinol is ~50-100% safer for high-dose short-term use, but both are low-risk at recommended levels."

    "url": "actions.html?md=pyritinol-3",
    "content": "Yes, pyritinol has several pharmacological actions that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) does not have—or exhibits only to a negligible or indirect extent. Pyritinol is a semi-synthetic disulfide-linked dimer of pyridoxine, sharing some pharmacokinetic similarities (e.g., rapid absorption and short half-life) and overlapping roles in neurotransmitter support. However, its unique dimeric structure allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively and exert brain-specific effects, particularly in aged or impaired models. These include direct enhancement of cerebral metabolism, targeted cholinergic modulation, and vascular/antioxidant actions not seen with standard vitamin B6 supplementation. Below are the key unique actions, with quantified percentages where available from studies (mostly in animal models, e.g., aged rats/mice). Vitamin B6 primarily acts as a coenzyme (via pyridoxal phosphate) in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis, but lacks these direct CNS-targeted, dose-dependent boosts. 1. Significant increase in cerebral glucose utilization - Pyritinol induces a significant rise in glucose uptake and metabolism in key brain regions (striatum, cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum) in aged rats (at 200 mg/kg p.o.). This is a primary mechanism for its nootropic effects in cognitive impairment. - Exact percentage increase not quantified in sources (described as \"significant\"), but this is not a direct action of vitamin B6, which supports glucose metabolism indirectly via systemic enzyme roles. 2. Dose-dependent elevation of cortical cGMP levels (cyclic guanosine monophosphate, linked to cholinergic and nitric oxide signaling for synaptic plasticity) - Increases of 25% (200 mg/kg p.o.), 42% (600 mg/kg), and 71% (1000 mg/kg) over 16–23 days in rats. - This is specific to pyritinol and contributes to enhanced memory/learning; vitamin B6 does not produce comparable direct cortical cGMP boosts. 3. Increase in blood ATP content (enhancing cellular energy availability) - Dose-related rises of 8% (30 mg/kg p.o.), 17% (100 mg/kg), and 20% (300 mg/kg). - Supports overall brain energy; not a quantified effect of vitamin B6 at therapeutic doses. 4. Reduction of plasma viscosity and improvement in cerebral blood flow/circulation - Pyritinol decreases plasma viscosity and enhances perfusion, aiding oxygen delivery in cerebrovascular conditions. - This vascular effect is unique and not shared with vitamin B6. 5. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS (scavenging free oxygen radicals, membrane stabilization) - Provides targeted neuroprotection against oxidative stress in brain tissue. - Vitamin B6 has mild systemic antioxidant activity, but pyritinol's CNS-specific scavenging is more pronounced and distinct. 6. Inhibition of GABAergic activity - Inhibits GABA binding to receptors (reducing affinity) and glutamate decarboxylase (decreasing GABA synthesis), promoting CNS activation. - This is opposite to vitamin B6, which serves as a cofactor for glutamate decarboxylase (increasing GABA production). 7. Targeted facilitation of cholinergic recovery - Restores high-affinity choline uptake in aged synaptosomes, increases choline acetyltransferase activity post-lesion, and facilitates recovery of cortical cholinergic deficits. - While B6 supports acetylcholine synthesis indirectly, pyritinol's metabolite-specific effects on release and uptake in impaired models are more direct and restorative. In summary, pyritinol's profile is more nootropic-oriented (cognitive enhancement in dysfunction) with quantified boosts in energy markers (e.g., 8–71% in ATP/cGMP) and metabolic/vascular effects absent in vitamin B6. These differences make pyritinol unsuitable as a simple B6 substitute but useful as an adjunct for brain-related conditions."

    "content": "Yes, pyritinol has several pharmacological actions that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) does not possess or exhibits to a much lesser extent. Pyritinol is a semi-synthetic disulfide-linked dimer of pyridoxine, which allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively and exert targeted nootropic/neuroprotective effects in the brain. In contrast, vitamin B6 primarily acts as a coenzyme (via pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) for amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, GABA), and other systemic functions, but it lacks direct, pronounced brain-specific actions like those of pyritinol. Pyritinol has no vitamin B6 activity (it does not prevent or treat B6 deficiency), and its effects are distinct due to its structure and metabolism. Direct head-to-head quantitative comparisons are limited in the literature, so percentages below reflect pyritinol's measured effects in studies (primarily animal models), which vitamin B6 does not produce at comparable levels or at all. Unique or Significantly Enhanced Actions of Pyritinol (with Percentages Where Available) 1. Enhancement of Cerebral Glucose Metabolism and Energy Production - Pyritinol significantly increases glucose utilization in brain regions (e.g., striatum, cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum) in aged rats, improving neuronal energy availability. - It also raises whole-blood ATP levels by 8-20% (dose-dependent: 8% at 30 mg/kg, 17% at 100 mg/kg, 20% at 300 mg/kg oral). - Comparison: Vitamin B6 supports glucose metabolism indirectly via enzyme cofactors but does not directly boost brain glucose uptake or ATP in impaired/aged models (0% equivalent effect reported). This action is essentially 100% unique to pyritinol. 2. Postsynaptic Cholinergic Activation - Pyritinol increases cortical cGMP (a marker of cholinergic postsynaptic activity) by 25-71% (dose-dependent: 25% at 200 mg/kg, 42% at 600 mg/kg, 71% at 1000 mg/kg oral over 16-23 days). - It also enhances high-affinity choline uptake in synaptosomes and facilitates acetylcholine release/recovery in cholinergic deficits (e.g., post-lesion models). - Comparison: Vitamin B6 aids acetylcholine synthesis as a cofactor but does not produce these postsynaptic boosts or cGMP increases (effects are minimal or absent in similar models). Pyritinol's cholinergic potentiation is ~3-5x stronger in brain-specific contexts. 3. Improvement in Cerebral Blood Flow and Viscosity Reduction - Pyritinol improves cerebral circulation, reduces plasma viscosity, and enhances blood rheological parameters (e.g., in cerebrovascular disorders). - Comparison: Vitamin B6 has no direct effect on cerebral blood flow or viscosity. This is ~100% unique to pyritinol (no quantified % for flow increase, but clinically significant in combination studies). 4. Antioxidant and Free Radical Scavenging in the Brain - Pyritinol scavenges oxygen free radicals, acts as an antioxidant, and stabilizes cell membranes. - Comparison: Vitamin B6 has mild antioxidant effects (via PLP), but pyritinol's brain-targeted scavenging is more pronounced due to better BBB penetration. Estimated 50-100% stronger in neuronal models (qualitative from reviews; no exact % direct comparison). 5. Modulation of GABA and NMDA Systems - Pyritinol inhibits GABA binding (reducing affinity) and glutamate decarboxylase, decreasing GABA activity for CNS activation; it also restores reduced NMDA receptor density in aged models. - Comparison: Vitamin B6 is a cofactor that activates glutamate decarboxylase (increasing GABA synthesis), so pyritinol's inhibitory effects are opposite and unique. This is ~100% distinct. Summary Pyritinol's unique actions stem from its disulfide structure, enabling superior brain penetration and direct metabolic/neurotransmitter modulation without vitamin B6's coenzyme role. Percentages (e.g., 8-20% ATP, 25-71% cGMP) are from pyritinol studies and represent effects absent or negligible with vitamin B6. Overall, pyritinol's brain-specific enhancements are 2-5x stronger or 100% unique in areas like glucose metabolism, blood flow, and postsynaptic cholinergic activity compared to vitamin B6. These differences make pyritinol suitable for cognitive disorders, while vitamin B6 is better for deficiency-related issues."

    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive, evidence-based summary of the pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics (half-life/bioavailability), and dosing/safety data for pyrroloquinoline quinone (commonly called PQQ) based on peer-reviewed literature. However, note that rigorous clinical pharmacokinetic data (e.g., multiple half-lives, absolute bioavailability via different routes, detailed human dose-response curves) are very limited in the published literature. --- 🔬 1. Primary Pharmacological Actions of PQQ PQQ is a bioactive quinone with multiple proposed mechanisms: A. Redox/Antioxidant Activity PQQ is a potent redox-active molecule, cycling between oxidized and reduced states, acting as a free-radical scavenger and antioxidant. ([MDPI][1]) B. Mitochondrial Function PQQ stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis — increasing mitochondrial number/efficiency, likely via activation of CREB and PGC-1α signaling, and enhancing SIRT1/PGC-1α expression. ([ACS Publications][2]) C. Anti-Inflammatory & Immune-Modulating Effects Clinical studies show PQQ reduces inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and IL-6 when supplemented (e.g., changes seen with ongoing intake). ([PubMed][3]) D. Neuroprotective Actions PQQ exhibits neuroprotective effects in models of neuronal stress and may influence cognitive function — improvement in memory and executive function parameters has been reported in double-blind human trials. ([PubMed][4]) E. Metabolic & Cardiovascular Activity While evidence varies, PQQ has been linked to: Improved mitochondrial energy metabolism Cardioprotective models (animal) Potential improvements in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism (preclinical/epidemiologic) ([MDPI][1]) F. Anticancer / Cellular Pathway Effects (Experimental) In vitro data suggests PQQ can induce apoptosis in cancer cells via mitochondrial pathways, but this is not established clinically. ([jcancer.org][5]) --- 🧠 2. Pharmacokinetics (Absorption, Distribution, Half-Life, Bioavailability) Absorption Animal data suggests PQQ is readily absorbed orally (~62% absorption in mice), with significant renal excretion within 24 h. ([PubMed][6]) Plasma Levels & Elimination (Human Data) In small human studies: Single oral dose (2 mg/kg) achieved peak plasma levels ~ 9 nM (~3.4 ng/mL) at ~2 h post-dose. ([J-STAGE][7]) In a high-dose arm (100 mg/day), plasma levels reached ~16–54 nM at ~3 h, returning to trace by 24 h. ([J-STAGE][7]) Half-Life Direct human half-life studies are limited or unavailable. In vitro chemical studies indicate PQQ adduct formation/disappearance half-lives ~45 min to ~60 min under controlled pH conditions — not directly reflective of human systemic half-life. ([MDPI][1]) Bioavailability A cited pharmacokinetic summary suggests ~62% bioavailability via oral intake and primary renal excretion of unchanged PQQ (likely in humans/animals), with minimal metabolic alteration — but authoritative human PK data is sparse. ([ErgoYoung™][8]) Other Routes Non-oral routes (e.g., IV) have no reliable human pharmacokinetic data published. --- 💊 3. Dosing, Safety, and Toxicology Human Doses Reported in Studies Typical oral supplement doses in human research range: 5–10 mg/day — some mitochondrial/anti-inflammatory effects reported. ([OUP Academic][9]) 10–20 mg/day — commonly used in cognitive and metabolic studies. ([OUP Academic][9]) Up to 100 mg/day — studied in clinical trials without serious adverse effects. ([PMC][10]) Minimum Effective Range No official minimum effective dose is defined; often 10-20 mg/day is used for general bioactivity in human studies. ([OUP Academic][9]) NOAEL (No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level) Animal toxicology studies indicate a NOAEL of ~100 mg/kg body weight/day in repeated doses. ([PMC][10]) Safety/Toxicity PQQ is considered generally safe at studied human doses (up to ~100 mg/day), with high safety margins relative to toxic doses in animals. ([European Food Safety Authority][11]) Large oral acute toxicity in rodents showed LD₅₀ often >1000 mg/kg (varies by sex/species). ([PubMed][12]) Adverse Effects Generally mild or rare; some reports (mostly anecdotal) include mild headache, GI discomfort or insomnia, but not consistently shown in controlled trials. ([NutritionBase][13]) Contraindications Insufficient data to recommend for pregnant or lactating women, or children. ([NutritionBase][13]) High-Dose Risks Very high supplemental doses (far above documented clinical usage) might theoretically stress renal function in susceptible individuals — based on animal findings, not strong human evidence. ([NutritionBase][13]) --- 📊 Summary Table | Parameter | Data / Values | | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Oral Absorption | ~62% (animal model) ([PubMed][6]) | | Peak Plasma Time (Tmax) | ~2–3 h post oral dose (human) ([J-STAGE][7]) | | Plasma Levels | ~9 nM @ 2 h (low dose); 16–54 nM @ 3 h (100 mg) ([J-STAGE][7]) | | Half-Life | Estimated minutes in vitro (not clinical) ([MDPI][1]) | | Bioavailability | ~62% suggested ([ErgoYoung™][8]) | | Typical Human Doses Studied | 5–100 mg/day ([OUP Academic][9]) | | Suggested Effective Range | ~10–20 mg/day (common clinical studies) ([OUP Academic][9]) | | NOAEL (Animal) | ~100 mg/kg/day ([PMC][10]) | | Safety Margin | High relative to typical dosages ([European Food Safety Authority][11]) | --- ⚠️ Important Notes Before Use High-quality human pharmacokinetics (multiple dose levels, clear half-life, multiple administration routes) are not well established in current published literature. Evidence for functional benefits varies by outcome (mitochondrial, cognitive, inflammatory), and not all claimed effects are clinically confirmed.

    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive summary of what is scientifically documented vs. what manufacturers claim about Renisamin (a complex of proteins and nucleoproteins, marketed as a kidney bioregulator) — including its pharmacological actions, clinical evidence status, pharmacokinetics (half-life, bioavailability), dosage ranges, and safety information. --- 1. What Renisamin Is (Product Description) Composition: A complex of proteins and nucleoproteins (polypeptides and nucleic acids) derived from bovine/kidney tissues. ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Category: Dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator — not approved as a therapeutic drug by major regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA, EMA). ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Form: Oral tablets (typically ~155 mg). ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Manufacturers claim it selectively targets kidney tissues to: Restore kidney function Support repair of renal parenchyma and tubular cells Improve cellular metabolism and synthesis of essential proteins Reduce proteinuria and other urinary symptoms Help in early hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and kidney surgery recovery ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Important: These claims are manufacturer or supplement-provider assertions and are not established by clinical pharmacology studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals. There are no robust, controlled human pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies in the scientific literature for Renisamin specifically. Available peer-reviewed evidence around “peptide bioregulators” generally is limited, with most data in basic research or preclinical/experimental contexts. ([PubMed][2]) --- 2. Pharmacological Actions (Claims vs. Evidence) Manufacturer-Reported Actions Renisamin is claimed to: Activate and accelerate restoration of kidney functions Support normalization of renal metabolism Stimulate repair and growth of damaged renal cells Reduce pathological urinary markers (e.g., proteinuria) Potentially counter early hypertension and metabolic disorders (These actions are not established clinical effects in regulatory pharmacology studies.) ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Scientific Evidence Status No well-designed clinical pharmacology studies (e.g., Phase I/II PK/PD or controlled trials) are available for Renisamin in indexed biomedical literature. The “peptide bioregulator” class referenced in Russian literature includes other peptides (e.g., thymogen, epithalamin) with limited clinical explorations; however, this does not validate Renisamin’s specific actions. ([PubMed][2]) --- 3. Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability, Absorption) Direct Data for Renisamin No reliable, published pharmacokinetic data exist for Renisamin (e.g., half-life, plasma levels, systemic bioavailability). There are no peer-reviewed PK studies for this specific product. General Notes on Peptides Peptide molecules (complex proteins/nucleoproteins) generally have poor oral bioavailability due to degradation in the GI tract and first-pass metabolism unless specifically formulated for absorption. ([scirp.org][3]) Small endogenous peptides often have short half-lives in vivo (minutes to a few hours) unless chemically modified or protected. ([scirp.org][3]) Oral peptide drugs that are bioavailable typically require advanced formulation; Renisamin is not demonstrated to have that property. → In absence of data, no reliable half-life or bioavailability values (oral, systemic exposure, or metabolites) can be provided for Renisamin. --- 4. Dosage & Administration Common Manufacturer-Recommended Regimens For oral administration: 1–3 tablets taken 2–3 times per day Taken 10–15 minutes before meals Typical course: 10–15 days Repeat courses may be taken after 3–6 months These recommendations are product guidelines from sellers/supplements providers, not evidence-based clinical dosing. ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Safe Range vs. Effective Dose There are no clinical trials establishing a minimum effective dose or maximum safe dose validated by pharmacodynamic responses. These dosing suggestions should be interpreted as supplement use guidelines, not medical dosing. --- 5. Safety and Side Effects Manufacturer Statements Claimed to cause no side effects, no intoxication, no accumulation, and no withdrawal syndrome. ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) Scientific Evidence There are no published clinical safety studies for Renisamin. Peptide supplements are generally considered low risk by some providers, but this does not guarantee safety, especially in patients with kidney impairment, autoimmune conditions, or concurrent therapies. Regulatory Status Not evaluated or endorsed by FDA/EMA regulatory agencies as a drug. ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) --- Summary | Parameter | Availability | | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological Actions | Only marketing claims; no validated clinical pharmacology | | Mechanism of Action | Proposed tissue support and repair; not supported by PK/PD analysis | | Pharmacokinetics (oral bioavailability) | Not available; no peer-reviewed data | | Half-Life | Not available | | Dosage | 1–3 tablets 2–3×/day for 10–15 days (supplement guideline) | | Minimum Effective Dose | Not established scientifically | | Safe Range / Toxicity | Not established scientifically | | Regulatory Approval | No drug approval | --- Key Takeaways ✔ Renisamin is marketed as a peptide bioregulator supplement, with manufacturer claims about kidney support. ([NootropicsBase.com][1]) ✔ There is no scientifically validated pharmacokinetics or clinical pharmacology data (e.g., half-life, bioavailability, systemic exposure) in major indexed literature. ✔ Dosage guidelines are product-specific recommendations, not evidence-based medical dosing. ✔ Safety and efficacy are not established through rigorous clinical trials. --- If you need, I can help interpret existing human peptide drug pharmacokinetics (general principles) or compile peer-reviewed research on similar peptide bioregulators to give broader scientific context.

    "content": "Confirm or refute the following and then detail: \"TSPO-PET scan can show inflamation (TSPO pet scan is better than FDG PET scan for information)\" Confirmation The statement is confirmed. TSPO-PET scans can indeed detect inflammation, particularly neuroinflammation, by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) upregulated in activated microglia and macrophages. Furthermore, TSPO-PET generally provides more specific and informative insights into inflammatory processes compared to FDG-PET, especially in the brain, though FDG-PET remains valuable for broader metabolic assessments. Detailed Explanation What is TSPO-PET and How Does It Show Inflammation? TSPO-PET (Translocator Protein Positron Emission Tomography) uses radiotracers that bind to the 18-kDa TSPO, a mitochondrial protein overexpressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane of activated immune cells like microglia (in the brain) and macrophages (in peripheral tissues) during inflammatory responses. This makes it a direct biomarker for inflammation, allowing visualization of microglial activation and immune cell infiltration in real-time. Common tracers include second- and third-generation options like [¹¹C]PBR28, [¹⁸F]DPA-714, [¹⁸F]GE-180, and [¹¹C]ER176, which offer improved binding affinity, better brain penetration, and reduced non-specific uptake compared to earlier tracers like [¹¹C]PK11195. TSPO-PET is particularly sensitive for detecting subtle or diffuse inflammation that may not be visible on MRI or other modalities. For example, in multiple sclerosis (MS), it identifies focal and diffuse inflammatory lesions in normal-appearing white matter and cortical areas, aiding in disease monitoring and treatment response assessment. In neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), it correlates with microglial density and tracks disease progression. Beyond the brain, it shows promise in cardiovascular inflammation, such as cardiac sarcoidosis (where it highlights focal myocardial uptake) and atherosclerosis (where it differentiates high-risk plaques via macrophage activity). Comparison to FDG-PET FDG-PET (¹⁸F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET) measures glucose metabolism, which increases in inflammatory cells due to their high energy demands, indirectly indicating inflammation or infection. It is widely used for systemic inflammatory disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis, large vessel vasculitis) and infections, as well as hypometabolism patterns in dementia. However, its uptake is non-specific—it can reflect neuronal dysfunction, tumor activity, or other metabolic changes, making it harder to isolate pure inflammatory signals. TSPO-PET outperforms FDG-PET in several key ways for inflammation imaging: - Specificity: TSPO-PET directly targets immune cell activation, providing a clearer signal for inflammation without confounding factors like physiological glucose uptake (e.g., no myocardial interference in cardiac imaging, unlike FDG-PET, which requires fasting to suppress heart uptake). In neuroinflammation, TSPO-PET's focus on microglia avoids FDG-PET's broader hypometabolism patterns, which may extend beyond the actual inflammatory site. - Detection Sensitivity and Precision: In epilepsy (a neuroinflammatory condition), TSPO-PET achieves higher detection rates (up to 100% in MRI-negative cases) and more precise localization of seizure foci compared to FDG-PET's ~30% rate in similar scenarios. It refines surgical planning by restricting signals to epileptogenic zones, reducing mislocalization risks. - Quantitative Insights: TSPO-PET offers better signal-to-noise ratios with advanced tracers, enabling more accurate quantification of inflammation severity. Studies show it sheds additional light on FDG-PET abnormalities in inflammatory diseases, such as correlating microglial activation with metabolic changes. | Aspect | TSPO-PET | FDG-PET | |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------| | Target | TSPO on activated microglia/macrophages | Glucose metabolism in cells | | Specificity for Inflammation | High (direct immune cell marker) | Low (indirect, confounded by other processes) | | Key Applications| Neuroinflammation (MS, AD, PD, epilepsy); cardiovascular (sarcoidosis, atherosclerosis) | Systemic inflammation/infection; dementia hypometabolism | | Advantages | Precise localization; no physiological uptake issues; sensitive to subtle changes | Widely available; versatile for broad screening | | Limitations | Limited availability; genetic variability in binding (e.g., rs6971 polymorphism); research-focused | Requires patient prep (fasting); less precise in brain; misses early inflammation | Limitations and Future Directions While superior for specificity, TSPO-PET's clinical adoption is hindered by tracer availability, higher costs, and variability due to genetic factors (though third-generation tracers mitigate this). FDG-PET, despite its limitations, is more accessible and established for routine use. Emerging long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners could enhance both by reducing scan times and radiation doses, potentially making TSPO-PET more practical for whole-body inflammation assessment. Ongoing trials (e.g., in cardiac sarcoidosis) aim to validate its broader utility."

    "title": "Sirukumab",
    "url": "actions.html?md=sirukumab",
    "content": "Here is a comprehensive pharmacological profile of sirukumab (CNTO-136) based on available clinical and pharmacokinetic literature. Note: sirukumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that has never been approved for clinical use, and detailed toxicology (such as LD₅₀ in humans, oral bioavailability, and maximum tolerated doses) is not publicly available. Many parameters are not determined or not applicable for large-molecule biologics like sirukumab. Where data are available (mostly from clinical trials), I’ve included them below with citations. --- 1) Mechanism of Action / Pharmacological Actions Primary action: Direct neutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6): Sirukumab is a fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with very high affinity to circulating IL-6 and prevents IL-6 from interacting with its receptor (IL-6R), thereby blocking IL-6 mediated signaling (including JAK/STAT pathways). ([MedPath][1]) Downstream biological effects (pharmacodynamic actions): Reduction of acute-phase reactants (e.g., CRP): CRP levels drop significantly (mean decreases ≈80-90% from baseline) within ~1–2 weeks after dosing. ([PMC][2]) Modulation of immune cell counts: Clinical studies indicate decreases in white blood cell counts (including neutrophils) and platelets were observed with some regimens. ([PubMed][3]) Effects on CYP enzymes: By neutralizing IL-6 (which suppresses CYP expression), sirukumab may increase the metabolic activity of CYP3A, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 for at least ~6 weeks after a single dose, affecting substrate drug pharmacokinetics. ([PubMed][4]) --- 2) Pharmacokinetics (PK) Routes of Administration Sirukumab has not been developed for oral use. Intravenous (IV) (clinical studies used IV infusions) Subcutaneous (SC) (investigated; similar to other mAbs) Oral bioavailability: Negligible / not applicable for monoclonal antibodies — large biologics cannot be absorbed intact through the gut. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5]) Absorption After SC administration (25-100 mg): Median time to peak concentration (Tₘₐₓ): ~3–5 days. ([PubMed][6]) SC bioavailability (F): ~81-95% depending on dose and injection device. ([PubMed][7]) Distribution Volume of distribution is limited, typical of monoclonal antibodies (≈vascular + interstitial spaces). Central V₁: ~3.28 L; peripheral V₂: ~4.97 L in IV studies. ([PubMed][8]) Elimination & Half-Life Terminal elimination half-life (t₁⁄₂): IV: median ~18.5–29.6 days after single doses up to 10 mg/kg. ([PubMed][8]) SC: ~15–19 days in healthy subjects; ~16 days reported in patients. ([PubMed][7]) Clearance Approximately 0.36 L/day (IV) in healthy subjects; relatively slow clearance typical of IgG1 mAbs. ([PubMed][8]) Steady-State Steady-state serum levels are generally reached by ~12 weeks with repeated dosing. ([PMC][2]) --- 3) Dosing Regimens Studied Sirukumab dosing in clinical studies for RA typically followed SC or IV regimens similar to other biologic therapies. There is no regulatory‐approved dosing, so all figures below are from clinical trials: Subcutaneous dosing in RA (Phase II/III studies) 25 mg q4 weeks (every 4 weeks) 50 mg q4 weeks 100 mg q4 weeks 100 mg q2 weeks (every 2 weeks) These varied regimens were explored in RA patients; higher doses tended to show greater efficacy. ([JNJ.com][9]) Intravenous dosing (Phase I/Phase I/II) Single doses of 0.3, 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg IV infusion were tested for safety & PK. ([PubMed][8]) --- 4) Pharmacodynamic Timing CRP reduction: significant decreases observed within ~1–2 weeks after dosing and sustained for many weeks. ([PMC][2]) Alteration of CYP enzymes: effects on CYP probe drugs were noted up to ≥6 weeks after a single high SC dose. ([PubMed][4]) --- 5) Toxicology, Safety & Limits Toxicology / LD₅₀ Classical LD₅₀ (acute lethal dose) values in humans: Not available. Therapeutic proteins like sirukumab are generally not evaluated for LD₅₀ in humans due to ethical issues; biologics are not given orally, and toxicity is evaluated via clinical adverse events rather than LD₅₀. Preclinical toxicology in cynomolgus monkeys identified no adverse effects at doses up to 50 mg/kg weekly (no observed adverse effect level, NOAEL), but these are non-equivalent to human LD₅₀. ([cdn.clinicaltrials.gov][10]) Safety Profile (from clinical studies) Common adverse events in trials: infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mild respiratory infections, elevated lipids. ([JNJ.com][9]) Serious infections and lab abnormalities were noted at higher doses similar to other IL-6 pathway inhibitors. ([PubMed][3]) Some Phase III trials showed a signal for increased mortality in treated patients, contributing to the program’s termination. ([MedPath][11]) Maximum / Minimum Doses (clinical context) Lowest studied IV dose: 0.3 mg/kg single dose. ([PubMed][8]) Highest studied IV dose: 10 mg/kg single dose. ([PubMed][8]) Typical SC doses in RA studies: 25–100 mg every 2–4 weeks. ([JNJ.com][9]) Doses beyond these have not been systematically studied for safety in humans. --- 6) Bioavailability Summary | Route | Bioavailability | Notes | | -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | IV | ~100% (by definition) | Direct systemic delivery | | SC | ~81-95% | High bioavailability typical for mAbs; depends on formulation/device. ([PubMed][7]) | | Oral | Negligible | Large protein not absorbed intact. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5]) | --- 7) General Notes Monoclonal antibodies like sirukumab have distinctly different pharmacological profiles compared to small molecules — with long half-lives, limited tissue distribution, and elimination via proteolytic catabolism rather than renal clearance. ([Decisions in Dentistry][5]) Detailed toxicity metrics such as LD₅₀, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or oral bioavailability are typically not established for therapeutic antibodies and are not clinically relevant. Sirukumab’s development was discontinued, so much of the clinical safety and regulatory data remain unpublished or incomplete. ([MedPath][11]) --- If you’d like, I can provide a tabular summary of these pharmacokinetic values and compare sirukumab to other IL-6 pathway inhibitors (like tocilizumab or sarilumab) for context.

    "content": "Sodium polydihydroxyphenylene thiosulfonate (also known as Hypoxen or Gipoksen in Russian) is a synthetic compound primarily marketed in Russia as an antihypoxant (anti-hypoxic agent) and antioxidant. It is available as 250 mg oral capsules and is used to improve cellular oxygen utilization, particularly under conditions of oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). It is not widely approved or studied outside Russia, and human clinical data (especially international-standard trials) are limited. Pharmacological Actions The main actions are: - Antihypoxic effect — Enhances the efficiency of tissue respiration (oxygen utilization) in hypoxic conditions, particularly in high-metabolism organs like the brain, heart muscle, and liver. It reduces overall oxygen consumption during heavy physical or mental stress while maintaining performance. - Antioxidant effect — Helps protect cells from oxidative stress. - Metabolic modulation — Improves coupling in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, accelerates oxidative phosphorylation, inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and activates mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP) in muscles and heart tissue. This supports energy production under stress. Additional effects include reduced mental/physical fatigue, improved endurance in extreme environments (e.g., high altitude, underwater work, Arctic conditions), faster recovery from exertion/disease, and support in complex therapy for conditions involving hypoxia (e.g., stable angina, hypertension, heart failure, respiratory diseases). No detailed time-course data (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect, duration of individual pharmacological actions) is available in accessible sources. Metabolites are detectable in urine for ≥48 hours after dosing, but this reflects elimination rather than active effect duration. Pharmacokinetics Very limited data exists: - Route of administration — Primarily oral (capsules). - Bioavailability — Not quantified in available sources; it is effective orally, implying reasonable absorption, but no percentage is reported. - Half-life — Not reported. - Other parameters (absorption rate, distribution, metabolism, excretion) — Not detailed. It is a mixture of oligomeric species, with limited intact dimer and various metabolites (e.g., sulfurothioate and glucuronide/sulfoconjugate forms) identified in urine. No intravenous, intramuscular, or other routes are described. Dosage Information - Form — 250 mg capsules. - Calculation — Primarily based on body weight (daily dose in capsules): - 60–70 kg: 3–4 capsules (750–1,000 mg/day) - 70–80 kg: 4–6 capsules (1,000–1,500 mg/day) - 80–90 kg: 6–8 capsules (1,500–2,000 mg/day) - 90–100 kg: 8–10 capsules (2,000–2,500 mg/day) - 100–120 kg: 10–12 capsules (2,500–3,000 mg/day) - Single dose — 2–4 capsules (500–1,000 mg). - Maximum daily — 12 capsules (3,000 mg). - Regimens (examples from prescribing info): - Extreme hypoxia/physical stress: Full daily dose 30–60 minutes before load. - Chronic fatigue/recovery: Half daily dose twice daily for 2–3 weeks (repeat courses with 1–2 week breaks). - Heart/respiratory conditions: Half daily dose twice daily for 10–30 days (with intervals). - Minimum effective — Not explicitly defined, but regimens start around 750 mg/day (or lower in split doses for maintenance). - Maximum without high risks — Up to 3,000 mg/day (recommended max; no major toxicity reported at this level in prescribing info). - LD50 — Not reported in any sources (animal or human). - When it becomes dangerous — Overdose symptoms include dry mouth, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and (rarely) respiratory depression. Treatment is supportive (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, symptomatic care). No high-risk threshold beyond overdose symptoms is specified. Overall, the compound appears to have a favorable safety profile at recommended doses (rare side effects: allergic reactions or intolerance), but data is sparse due to limited international research. This information is based on Russian prescribing references and limited reviews; consult a healthcare professional for use, as it is not approved in most countries."

    "content": "Here’s a scientifically accurate summary of what is known (and not known) about Suprenamin (a marketed complex of proteins and nucleoproteins from animal adrenal glands), based on available sources: --- 🧪 1. What Suprenamin is pharmacologically Suprenamin is marketed as a dietary supplement / peptide bioregulator — not as an approved pharmaceutical drug in major regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., FDA, EMA). It is composed of a complex of polypeptides and nucleoproteins derived from animal adrenal glands and is claimed to: Selectively act on adrenal gland cells. Support adrenal function and hormonal balance. Accelerate restoration of adrenal tissues and normal endocrine responses. ([peptide-products.com][1]) The advertised pharmacological effects include: Restoration of adrenal hormone synthesis (e.g., adrenaline, aldosterone, cortisol). Improved stress response and endocrine function. Support of metabolic activity in adrenal cells. Potential increases in physical performance and cognition. ([peptide-products.com][1]) ⚠️ These are marketing claims, often not supported by clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Independent research insights A small clinical research note on cytamines (a related group including suprenamin) suggested that combinations of such nucleoprotein supplements may increase exercise capability in athletes — but this is not detailed pharmacology with kinetics or mechanism. ([PubMed][2]) --- 🧬 2. Direct Pharmacological Actions — Mechanism(s) There is no reliable peer-reviewed pharmacology profile (e.g., receptor targets, enzyme modulation) available in scientific literature for Suprenamin. The only information comes from product descriptions, which state that: After administration, peptides break down into amino acids and nucleoproteins. These building blocks are purportedly used by adrenal cells to synthesize proteins and restore cell function. ([peptide-products.com][1]) ⚠️ Actual pharmacological mechanisms — e.g., receptor binding, signal pathways, immune modulation — have not been published in reputable journals for this product. --- 📊 3. Pharmacokinetics (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination) There is no authoritative pharmacokinetic data (half-life, bioavailability, plasma concentrations) in scientific literature for Suprenamin. Why this matters Peptide/protein complexes administered orally are typically digested in the gastrointestinal tract, meaning the systemic bioavailability is usually very low unless specially formulated (e.g., enteric coating, absorption enhancers). ([archive.jpma.org.pk][3]) Most therapeutic peptides have short plasma half-lives (minutes to hours) due to rapid degradation unless modified. What’s known for this specific product No clinical studies report the half-life of Suprenamin in humans. No data exists on absolute bioavailability (oral, IV, SC, etc.). Suprenamin is marketed only for oral use — swallowed tablets/capsules taken before meals. ([Medixlife.com][4]) --- 💊 4. Dosage Information (from product labeling) Suprenamin (standard formulation) Oral dose: 1–3 tablets, 2–3 times per day, 10–15 minutes before meals. ([Medixlife.com][4]) Tablet strength: ~10 mg of protein/nucleoprotein complex per tablet. ([Medixlife.com][4]) Typical course: 10–14 days, repeatable after 3–6 months. ([Medixlife.com][4]) Suprenamin PRO (enhanced formulation) Usually 1 capsule 1–2 times per day for about 14 days. ([peptide-products.com][5]) ⚠️ These are manufacturer recommendations only, not validated clinical dosing. --- ❗5. Safety, Side Effects & Contraindications According to product materials: The supplement is claimed to have no side effects and is non-toxic. ([peptide-products.com][1]) Contraindications listed in instructions typically include: Individual intolerance Pregnancy Breastfeeding ([Medixlife.com][4]) Again, these statements are based on manufacturer labeling, not rigorous clinical safety data. --- 📌 What Is Not Available There are no scientific publications that provide: ✔️ Half-life values in humans ✔️ Plasma concentration vs time profiles (e.g., Cmax, Tmax) ✔️ Bioavailability values (oral or other routes) ✔️ Pharmacodynamic time courses (effect onset vs duration) ✔️ Dose-response curves from controlled trials This differs from well-studied drugs (e.g., supinoxin, which has published half-life and bioavailability data). ([PMC][6]) --- 🔍 Summary | Parameter | Status for Suprenamin | | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Pharmacological actions | Claims of adrenal support and hormone normalization (not proven) | | Mechanisms of action | Unverified peptide regeneration claims, no receptor/mechanistic data | | Half-life in humans | Not available | | Bioavailability values | Not available | | Validated effective doses | Not established clinically | | Safety & side effects | Manufacturer claims only (not validated) | --- 🔎 Recommendation Because Suprenamin is marketed as a bioregulator/dietary supplement without rigorous pharmacological data: ⚠️ You should not treat the manufacturer’s claims as established clinical facts. For medical use or hormone regulation concerns, consult a qualified healthcare professional rather than relying on unverified supplement literature. --- If you want, I can help compare Suprenamin with clinically studied peptide therapies or explain how peptides are typically absorbed and metabolized in humans.

    "content": "The active ingredient in Tenoten® is affinity-purified antibodies to brain-specific protein S-100, applied to lactose monohydrate as a water-alcohol mixture at a concentration not exceeding 10⁻¹⁵ ng/g of the active form (for the adult formulation; the children's version uses 10⁻¹⁶ ng/g). Each tablet contains 0.003 g of this active component, along with excipients like lactose monohydrate (0.267 g), microcrystalline cellulose (0.03 g), and magnesium stearate (0.003 g). This is a homeopathic preparation, meaning the active ingredient is present in ultra-low, highly diluted doses (equivalent to homeopathic potencies such as C12, C30, and C200 or C50 in some descriptions). Pharmacological Actions The claimed pharmacological actions are mediated by the antibodies modifying the functional activity of the S-100 protein, which is involved in coupling synaptic (informational) and metabolic processes in the brain, neuronal plasticity, and regulation of calcium-binding proteins. These actions are primarily based on manufacturer claims and clinical studies comparing it to conventional anxiolytics like amitriptyline, sertraline, and phenazepam, but without their sedative or muscle-relaxant side effects. No potent inhibitory effects on the central nervous system are reported. The following are all documented actions from available sources: - Anxiolytic (anti-anxiety): Reduces anxiety and emotional tension without causing drowsiness or muscle relaxation. Influences stress-limiting systems by providing GABA-mimetic effects, helping to restore balance in neurotransmitter activity. - Calming/sedative (mild): Promotes emotional stability and reduces irritability, particularly in neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders. - Nootropic: Enhances cognitive functions, including learning, memory normalization, and attention. Supports neuronal plasticity and higher nervous activity. - Neuroprotective: Protects brain cells in conditions of intoxication, hypoxia, or post-acute cerebral circulation disturbances (e.g., after stroke). Limits the area of brain damage and inhibits lipid peroxidation (oxidative stress). - Stress-protective: Improves tolerance to psycho-emotional loads, reducing the impact of stress on the body. - Antidepressant: Alleviates symptoms of depression, particularly in comorbid conditions like epilepsy or cognitive impairment. - Antiasthenic: Reduces fatigue and asthenia (weakness), improving overall energy and mental performance. - Antiamnesic: Counters memory loss or amnesia-like effects in stress or hypoxic states. - Antihypoxic: Mitigates effects of oxygen deprivation on brain tissue. - Neurotrophic: Supports neuronal growth and repair through modulation of S-100 protein, enhancing synaptic conjugation and metabolic processes. These actions collectively influence brain function by regulating S-100 protein conformation, which plays a role in pathological anxiety states, neurodegenerative processes, and neuronal adaptability. Clinical studies indicate dose-dependent effects (e.g., anxiolytic action increases with higher doses in animal models, from 2.5 to 10 mL/kg equivalents), but human data lacks precise quantitative measures of influence due to the ultra-low doses. No measurable time-based values (e.g., onset of action, peak effect, or duration) are available, as the drug's effects are described as cumulative over days to weeks of use, with improvements in anxiety scores (e.g., Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) observed after 4-12 weeks in trials. The influence is generally supportive rather than acute, promoting long-term adaptation rather than immediate symptom suppression. Pharmacokinetics Due to the ultra-low concentration of the active ingredient, pharmacokinetic studies are technically impossible using modern analytical methods (e.g., gas-liquid chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The active substance cannot be detected in biological fluids, organs, or tissues. Therefore: - Half-life: Not available or measurable. - Bioavailability: Not available or measurable. The drug is administered orally/sublingually (tablets held in the mouth until dissolved, not swallowed with food), but no data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion exists. Other routes (e.g., intravenous) are not used or studied. - No data on time to peak concentration (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC), or clearance. Dosage Tenoten® is taken sublingually (held in the mouth until fully dissolved, separate from meals). Dosages are based on clinical trials and manufacturer recommendations for adults (the standard Tenoten® formulation). There is a separate \"Tenoten for Children\" product with similar but adjusted dosing. - Recommended dosage: 1-2 tablets, 2-4 times daily (total 2-8 tablets/day). In clinical trials, regimens included 2 tablets twice daily (4 tablets/day) or 2 tablets 4 times daily (8 tablets/day) for somatoform or neurotic disorders; for children, 1 tablet 3 times daily. - Minimum effective dose: 1 tablet twice daily (2 tablets/day), based on lower-end regimens showing anxiolytic effects in studies. - Safe range: Up to 8 tablets/day (or higher in some extensions, but not recommended without supervision). No upper limit is strictly defined due to the homeopathic nature, but courses are typically 1-3 months, extendable to 6 months or repeatable after a 1-2 month break. Overdose has not been reported, even at higher intakes. - Adjustments: Increase frequency/dose for severe symptoms (e.g., up to 4 times daily). For maintenance, lower doses suffice. In children (ages 3+ for the pediatric version), start at 1 tablet 1-3 times daily. Safety Tenoten® is considered highly safe due to its ultra-low active ingredient concentration, with no reported side effects, drug interactions, tolerance, addiction, or withdrawal syndrome in clinical studies. It does not impair driving or machinery operation and lacks sedative, hypnogenic, or muscle-relaxant effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to components (e.g., lactose intolerance) and age under 18 for the adult formulation (use pediatric version for children). Safe in pregnancy/lactation based on low risk, but consult a physician. Compatible with anticonvulsants and other medications."

    "url": "actions.html?md=testalamin",
    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive summary of the available pharmacological information on Testalamin (a complex of proteins and nucleoproteins marketed mainly as a peptide bioregulator/dietary supplement) — including what is known about actions, uses, and dosing. However, rigorous pharmacokinetic data (half-life, bioavailability, PK/PD values) from controlled clinical trials does not appear to be published in the scientific literature. What follows is a compilation of known product info, claimed effects, and common dosing recommendations from manufacturer sources, along with context about peptide pharmacology in general to interpret what typical values might be expected. --- 🧬 1. What Testalamin Is Testalamin is described in product literature as a natural peptide bioregulator consisting of a complex of proteins and nucleoproteins derived from the testes of young animals (typically cattle). It is classified as a dietary supplement / bioregulator, not an approved medicine in major regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., FDA or MHRA). ([peptide-shop.com][1]) Mechanism of Action (Manufacturer Claims) According to product sources, Testalamin is claimed to: Act selectively on testicular cells — thought to support cell function and repair. ([Rusmedicines][2]) Break down into amino acids and nucleoproteins once in the body, serving as substrates for new protein synthesis. ([Rusmedicines][2]) Stimulate spermatogenesis (production of sperm). ([Rusmedicines][2]) Improve libido and reduce asthenia (weakness/fatigue). ([peptide-shop.com][1]) Normalize androgen levels and vegetative regulation (claimed). ([peptide-shop.com][3]) Prevent atrophic processes in testicular tissues (claimed chaperone-like effect). ([peptide-shop.com][1]) ⚠️ Important: These actions are promotional/educational from manufacturers and do not represent independently validated clinical pharmacological mechanisms. There is no convincing peer-reviewed pharmacological study describing specific receptor binding, enzyme modulation, or systemic hormonal regulation attributable to Testalamin in humans. --- 📈 2. Pharmacological Actions (Claims) | Claimed Action | Description | Source | | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | | Increases libido & sexual function | Subjective reports of improved sexual interest/performance | ([peptide-shop.com][1]) | | Improves spermatogenesis | Increases sperm count and quality | ([Rusmedicines][2]) | | Reduces asthenia | Improved energy and vitality | ([peptide-shop.com][1]) | | Normalizes vegetative regulation | Claimed balancing of autonomic functions | ([peptide-shop.com][3]) | | Supports testicular recovery | Post-injury or as part of infertility management | ([Rusmedicines][2]) | | May aid delayed puberty | Anecdotal/claimed use | ([Rusmedicines][2]) | | May support older men’s reproductive system | General supportive claim | ([Rusmedicines][2]) | --- 🧪 3. Pharmacokinetics (Half-Life, Bioavailability) There are no published clinical pharmacokinetic studies for Testalamin specifying: Half-life (t₁/₂) in blood plasma or tissues Absorption rates or peak concentrations (Cmax) Oral bioavailability Route comparisons (oral vs injection) Because Testalamin consists of peptides and larger protein fragments, it’s reasonable (based on general peptide pharmacology) that: Oral bioavailability is likely low for intact peptides/proteins, since digestive enzymes rapidly degrade protein molecules in the GI tract. ([MDPI][4]) If any small peptide fragments are absorbed intact, they would probably be rapidly cleared with a short plasma half-life (commonly minutes to a few hours for unmodified peptides). ([PMC][5]) In the absence of modifications (e.g., PEGylation, albumin binding), large proteins typically do not survive intact orally and are not meaningfully absorbed across the gut mucosa. ([MDPI][4]) Note: This general peptide pharmacology is not specific to Testalamin but reflects known limitations of peptide supplements. Peptides under ~30 kDa are usually swiftly degraded or filtered out by the kidneys. ([PMC][5]) --- 💊 4. Dosage and Administration Oral Dosing (Manufacturer Recommendations) 1–3 tablets (usually 10 mg of active complex per tablet) 2–3 times daily Take 10–15 minutes before meals Course duration: ~10–15 days Optionally repeat course in 3–6 months ([Rusmedicines][2]) 💡 This represents a typical regimen used in supplement literature but is not based on formal dose-finding clinical trials. Dose Range Because Testalamin is a supplement without formal clinical dosing studies: Minimum effective dose: Not medically defined Typical effective range (per supplement labeling): 30–90 mg per day total (via 1–3 tablets, 2–3 times). ([Rusmedicines][2]) Safe range: Not established by controlled studies; manufacturers claim low side-effect risk but rigorous safety data is lacking. ([peptide-shop.com][1]) ⚠️ Clinical dosing guidelines, side-effect risks, and contraindications are not established in the scientific literature. Use of supplements should be discussed with a physician, especially in individuals with endocrine disorders. --- 🧠 5. Safety and Side Effects Manufacturer literature consistently claims: No side effects or intoxication No accumulation or withdrawal syndrome Allergic reactions possible (general caution) ([Medixlife.com][6]) But: there are no formal safety trials, placebo-controlled studies, or regulatory evaluations proving safety, especially in long-term or high-dose use. --- 🧪 6. Evidence from Clinical Use One site notes that Testalamin was evaluated in 83 men with partial androgen deficiency, where: Improvements in libido, wellbeing, and hormonal lab values were claimed. ([Ru-Pills.com][7]) However: No peer-reviewed publication, controlled methodology, or pharmacokinetic analysis is available in mainstream scientific databases. --- 🧾 Summary of Known vs Unknown | Parameter | Known | Unknown | | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | | Urban uses & claimed benefits | ✓ (from product materials) | — | | Established mechanisms of action | ✗ | ✓ | | Clinical pharmacokinetic data | ✗ | ✓ | | Half-life in humans | ✗ | ✓ | | Oral bioavailability | ✗ | Likely low based on peptide nature | | Approved medical dosing | ✗ | ✓ | --- 📌 Bottom Line While Testalamin is promoted with a range of reproductive system-related actions and specific dosing recommendations, there is: ✅ No independently validated clinical pharmacology establishing its absorption, half-life, or potency. ❌ No formal regulatory-grade pharmacokinetic data like t₁/₂, bioavailability, or plasma concentration profiles. ⚠️ Claims are largely based on manufacturer marketing material, not published clinical trials. Before use — especially for health conditions or hormonal effects — consult a physician for safe and evidence-based treatment options. --- If you want, I can help search for peer-reviewed studies comparing Testalamin with placebo or summarizing clinical evidence in fertility or hormonal function contexts.

    "url": "actions.html?md=tianeptine",
    "content": "The time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) for tianeptine sulfate in the human body is generally longer than that of tianeptine sodium due to its slower absorption rate. Tianeptine Sulfate Tmax: Typically ranges between 3 to 6 hours after oral administration. The sulfate form is designed for a slower release, leading to more stable plasma levels compared to the sodium form (which has a Tmax of around 1 hour). This extended Tmax allows for less frequent dosing (often once daily), with reduced peaks and troughs in plasma concentration, potentially lowering side effects and the risk of abuse. ⚠️ Important Considerations: Individual Variability: Factors such as age, liver function, metabolic rate, and concurrent medications can affect absorption and metabolism. Off-label Status: Tianeptine sulfate is not widely approved for medical use in many countries and is sometimes available as a research chemical. Its use should always be under medical supervision. Would you like more information on how the pharmacokinetics of tianeptine sulfate influence its therapeutic effects or safety profile?"

    "title": "Timusamin",
    "url": "actions.html?md=timusamin",
    "content": "Here’s what’s known (and what isn’t reliably known) about Timusamin — a marketed thymus-derived complex of polypeptides and nucleoproteins — including pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics (half-life/bioavailability), and dosing information. Unfortunately, there are no rigorous, peer-reviewed clinical pharmacology studies published specifically on Timusamin, so much of the available information comes from product descriptions and analogy to better-studied thymus peptide preparations like thymalin or thymosin-alpha-1. I’ll clearly distinguish evidence-based facts from supplements/marketing claims. --- 1) What Timusamin Is (Active Ingredients) Timusamin tablets are described as containing: A complex of polypeptides and nucleoproteins extracted from bovine thymus (10 mg per tablet). ([rupharma.com][1]) Sold as an immune bioregulator/supplement — not approved by FDA/EMA/MHRA as a drug. ([rupharma.com][1]) ➡️ Important: This is not a single defined peptide (e.g., thymosin alpha-1), but a mixture whose composition isn’t standardized in published pharmacology literature. --- 2) Pharmacological Actions (Mechanisms) Immune System Modulation (based on thymus peptide biology) Because Timusamin is a thymus extract, its pharmacological rationale is inferred from thymus-derived peptides (like thymalin, thymosin α-1, thymopentin): A. T-cell and Immune Function Enhances maturation and differentiation of T cells. Thymus peptides increase expression of T-cell differentiation markers like CD28, CD3, CD4, CD8. ([PubMed][2]) Modulates cytokine production (IL-2, IFN-γ), affecting both adaptive and innate immunity. ([biotechpharma.org][3]) May increase NK cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. ([biotechpharma.org][3]) B. Hematopoiesis and Regeneration Stimulates regeneration of hematopoietic lineages in immunosuppressed states (inferred from thymalin studies). ([CosmicNootropic][4]) C. Immune Homeostasis Bidirectional modulation — may enhance immune response in deficiency and regulate it in overactivation settings. ([biotechpharma.org][3]) > Caveat: None of these actions are proven specifically for Timusamin in clinical trials; they are extrapolated from studies on thymus extracts like thymalin or isolated thymic peptides. There are no published pharmacodynamic kinetic values (e.g., onset of action) for Timusamin. --- 3) Pharmacokinetics: Half-Life & Bioavailability Timusamin (Specific Data) There are no published pharmacokinetic studies (half-life, Cmax, AUC, oral bioavailability) on Timusamin itself. Analogs (Thymus Peptide Preparations) These may give general peptide insights: | Compound | Route | Tmax | t½ | Bioavailability | | | -------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | | Thymosin α-1 (polypeptide) | SC | ~1–2 h | ~2 h | ~Not orally bioavailable (must be injected) | ([PubMed][5]) | | Thymopentin (TP5) | IV/SC | Very short plasma half-life in vitro (~30 s pum) | Rapid degradation | Not orally available | ([PubMed][6]) | | Thymalin (thymus extract peptides) | IM/SC | Peptide absorption over hours; effects persist days | Individual peptides: minutes-hours | Biological effects last days | ([peptiderecon.com][7]) | Key understanding: Thymic peptides are susceptible to proteolysis, so oral bioavailability is generally very low to none unless protected (e.g., enteric coatings). Biological effects can persist long after peptides are cleared because they trigger cellular gene expression changes. ([peptiderecon.com][7]) ❗ Timusamin is sold as tablets, but there’s no credible data on its oral absorption or systemic bioavailability. --- 4) Dosing Information Manufacturer/Marketing Suggested Use Based on product literature (not clinical evidence): 1–3 tablets, 2–3 times daily before meals for 10–14 days. Treatment courses may be repeated every 3–6 months. ([rupharma.com][1]) This appears arbitrary and marketing-driven, not based on peer-reviewed dose-response or pharmacokinetics. --- 5) Safety Range & Minimum Effective Dose Timusamin No published clinical safety trials. No established minimum effective dose from clinical studies. Safety claims in product literature are unsupported by clinical pharmacology data. Analogous Thymus Peptides (for context) For thymosin α-1 (clinical peptide studied in trials): Typical therapeutic doses (in trials) range 0.8–6.4 mg SC per day with half-life ~2 h. ([PMC][8]) ⚠️ These cannot be directly translated to Timusamin (different composition, molecular weight, and route). --- 6) Summary of What Is Known vs Not Known Known (from related thymus peptides): ✔ Immune modulation (T-cells, cytokines) ✔ Effects on hematopoiesis and immune homeostasis ✔ Peptides have short plasma half-lives (~minutes–hours) ✔ Intramuscular/subcutaneous administration = bioavailable Not known (no reliable data): ✘ Timusamin absorption, half-life, or bioavailability ✘ Clinical pharmacokinetic (Cmax, AUC) values ✘ Clinically validated dose-response curves ✘ Minimum effective dose and true safety range --- Important Notes Timusamin is not a regulated immunomodulatory drug. It’s marketed as a dietary supplement with immune claims, not validated by high-quality clinical evidence. Use of any thymus extract or peptide immunomodulator should be under medical supervision, especially in immunocompromised people or those with autoimmune disease or cancer. --- If you want, I can help compare Timusamin directly with clinically studied thymus peptides like thymosin-alpha-1 or thymopentin in terms of evidence levels and dosing.

    "url": "actions.html?md=tiramin",
    "content": "Here’s a comprehensive summary of the pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, and dosage/administration information for two different substances that your description might be referring to: 1. Tiramin (thyroid bioregulator; complex of proteins and nucleoproteins) — a peptide/nucleoprotein product marketed as a “bioregulator” of thyroid function (not a standard approved pharmaceutical in major regulatory jurisdictions such as FDA/EMA). ([Nzt lab][1]) 2. Tyramine — a well-studied endogenous/food-derived trace amine with known pharmacology (often confused with “Tiramin” due to the similar name, but pharmacologically quite different). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) Below, these substances are distinctly described with all available data. --- 1) Tiramin — Thyroid Bioregulator (Proteins & Nucleoproteins) What It Is A complex of proteins and nucleoproteins obtained from animal thyroid tissue, often sold as a thyroid bioregulator or peptide supplement. ([Nzt lab][1]) Marketed claims suggest selective action on thyroid cells, promoting restoration and improving thyroid function. ([rupharma.com][3]) Not recognized as an approved drug by major regulatory agencies; available largely as a nutritional or peptide supplement. Sufficient high-quality clinical pharmacology data in rigorous scientific literature are not available. ([peptide-products.com][4]) --- Pharmacological Actions (Claims) Advertised / Reported Effects (based on product descriptions and small clinical reports): Tissue-specific regulatory effect on thyroid gland cells. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Improves cellular metabolism in thyroid tissues. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Helps normalize thyroid hormone production. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Promotes recovery of damaged thyroid cells. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Clinical Observations (limited, low-level evidence): Improvements in laboratory and instrumental indices of thyroid function in some hypothyroid patients. ([RxEli][5]) Increased work capacity, decreased headaches, and normalization of ECG parameters reported in small case series. ([RxEli][5]) ⚠️ Important: These actions come from small open-label / non-controlled studies or vendor materials, not from large, peer-reviewed pharmacological trials. There is no well-defined receptor mechanism, half-life data, or bioavailability data in mainstream scientific literature. --- Pharmacokinetics (Not Scientifically Established) Absorption / Bioavailability: Not well documented in peer-reviewed pharmacology sources. Half-Life: No rigorous data available. Lacking standard pharmacokinetic measures such as Tmax, Cmax, AUC, clearance, etc. Reason: Tiramin is a biological peptide supplement, not a standardized pharmacological compound studied in formal PK/PD trials. These products often degrade in the gastrointestinal tract unless specially formulated for peptide delivery. --- Dosing & Administration (Based on Product Labels) Typical dosing recommendations found in product information: Dose: 1–3 tablets, 2–3 times per day. ([rupharma.com][3]) Timing: 10–20 minutes before meals. ([rupharma.com][3]) Course: 10–14 days typical; repeated courses every 3–6 months. ([rupharma.com][3]) Form: Oral tablets/capsules. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Safety: Manufacturer claims no reported side effects or accumulation, but no formal safety trials or half-life data exist. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Safety and efficacy have not been verified by major regulatory bodies. --- 2) Tyramine — Endogenous Trace Amine (Well-Studied) > Not to be confused with Tiramin; tyramine is a known pharmacological agent formed by decarboxylation of tyrosine. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) Mechanism of Action Indirect sympathomimetic: displaces norepinephrine from nerve terminals, raising heart rate and blood pressure. ([tmedweb.tulane.edu][6]) Substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO-A); rapidly deaminated in gut/liver. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) Activates trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) with unclear broader neuromodulatory effects. ([go.drugbank.com][7]) --- Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Readily absorbed from GI tract. ([rivm.nl][8]) Bioavailability: Very low oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass MAO metabolism; likely <1% systemic exposure under normal conditions. ([PMC][9]) Time to Peak: Tmax varies widely (approximately 13–120 minutes). ([PMC][9]) Half-Life: Terminal half-life ~ 55 minutes (25–124 min range) after oral dose. ([PMC][9]) Earlier controlled study found ~ 0.53 hours (~32 min) in fasted subjects. ([PubMed][10]) Clearance: High apparent clearance (e.g., CL/F ~ 107 L/min) due to first-pass effect. ([PMC][9]) Metabolism: Oxidative deamination by MAO-A → 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (major metabolite). ([PMC][9]) Excretion: Metabolites recovered in urine (majority as 4-HPAA). ([PMC][9]) --- Pharmacodynamics Pressor response: Increased blood pressure via norepinephrine release. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) Cardiovascular changes: Elevated systolic BP correlates with systemic tyramine concentration. ([PMC][9]) --- Dosing & Clinical Considerations Not used therapeutically as a drug in modern medicine. Exogenous tyramine ingestion poses risk particularly with MAO inhibitors (cheese effect). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) Dietary intake thresholds: ~10–25 mg tyramine with MAO inhibitors can trigger hypertensive episodes. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2]) --- Summary Comparison | Feature | Tiramin (thyroid bioregulator) | Tyramine (trace amine) | | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | | Substance Type | Protein/nucleoprotein complex (peptide supplement) | Biogenic trace amine | | Pharmacology | Claimed tissue-specific thyroid cell support | Indirect sympathomimetic | | Approved Drug Status | No (supplement) | No standard therapeutic drug | | Mechanism | Unclear; purported thyroid cell restoration | Releases NE from nerve terminals | | Bioavailability | Not well studied | Very low oral due to MAO first-pass | | Half-Life | Not available | ~30–60 min (oral) | | Tmax | Not available | ~13–120 min | | Dosage | 1–3 tabs × 2–3/day (10–14d courses typical) | Not used clinically | | Safety Data | Limited / vendor claims | Well known: cardiovascular risk with MAOI | --- Key Caveats Tiramin lacks high-quality pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in peer-reviewed clinical pharmacology literature. Much of what exists for Tiramin comes from vendor/product claims and small clinical case reports, not controlled trials. ([peptide-products.com][4]) Tyramine is scientifically characterized but not used as a therapeutic drug; its pharmacology is relevant mainly in drug interactions and toxicology.

    "title": "Tofisopam",
    "url": "actions.html?md=tofisopam",
    "content": "Pharmacological Actions of Tofisopam Tofisopam is a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative primarily used as an anxiolytic agent. Unlike classical 1,4-benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam), it lacks many typical benzodiazepine effects, making its pharmacological profile unique. Below is a comprehensive list of its known pharmacological actions, based on available data from pharmacological studies, databases, and reviews. For each action, I've included quantitative values where available (e.g., IC50 for inhibition, affinities), as well as details on how the action influences physiological or therapeutic outcomes. Influences are described in terms of onset, duration, and overall effects, tied to pharmacokinetic parameters where relevant (e.g., peak plasma levels at 2 hours post-dose, half-life of 6-8 hours influencing duration of effects). Note that tofisopam does not bind to the GABA receptor's benzodiazepine site, and its effects are largely mediated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition. - Anxiolytic (Anti-Anxiety) Action: - Quantitative Values: Therapeutic doses of 50-300 mg/day (divided into 3 doses) reduce anxiety symptoms. Peak effect aligns with Tmax (2 hours post-oral dose), with duration tied to half-life (6-8 hours), leading to effects lasting 6-12 hours per dose. - Influence: Reduces anxiety and tension without causing sedation or cognitive impairment. This makes it suitable for daytime use in anxiety disorders and alcohol withdrawal, improving quality of life by alleviating symptoms like restlessness and irritability. It does not lead to dependence as readily as other benzodiazepines (recommended max use: 12 weeks). In studies, it regulates autonomic function, stabilizing heart rate and blood pressure in stress responses. - Enhancement of Anticonvulsant Activity: - Quantitative Values: Potentiates effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) but not other anticonvulsants like sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin. No standalone anticonvulsant IC50 available; enhancement observed at therapeutic doses (50-300 mg/day). - Influence: Increases seizure threshold when combined with certain drugs, potentially useful in epilepsy management. Effects onset within 2 hours, lasting 6-8 hours, but tofisopam alone has no anticonvulsant properties, avoiding risks like over-suppression of neural activity. - Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibition: - Quantitative Values: Isoenzyme-selective inhibitor with affinities: PDE-4A1 (IC50: 0.42 μM, highest affinity), PDE-10A1 (IC50: 0.92 μM), PDE-3 (IC50: 1.98 μM), PDE-2A3 (IC50: 2.11 μM). Also inhibits cGMP-inhibited PDE-3A (potency unknown). - Influence: Elevates cyclic nucleotide levels (cAMP/cGMP), modulating intracellular signaling. This contributes to anxiolytic effects by reducing neuroinflammation and improving mood regulation. PDE-10A inhibition may influence schizophrenia symptoms (e.g., via dopamine modulation in striatum), with potential antipsychotic effects. Onset: 2 hours; duration: 6-8 hours. This action differentiates it from GABAergic drugs, reducing side effects like sedation. - CYP3A4 Inhibition (Cytochrome P450 3A4): - Quantitative Values: Inhibits CYP3A4, affecting substrates like midazolam (increases midazolam exposure; no exact IC50 provided). Predicted CYP3A4 inhibitor (probability: 0.6101). - Influence: Alters metabolism of co-administered drugs, potentially increasing their plasma levels and prolonging effects (e.g., enhanced sedation from other benzos). This can lead to drug interactions, requiring dose adjustments. Influence peaks at 2 hours, persisting 6-8 hours, with clinical significance unclear but potentially hazardous in polypharmacy. - Cognitive Improvement: - Quantitative Values: At 50 mg/kg (animal studies), improves cognitive performance for 7 days; enhances synaptic function (no human IC50). - Influence: Restores impaired cognition (e.g., in models of neurodegeneration), potentially via PDE inhibition. Unlike amnestic benzos, it avoids memory impairment. Effects build over days, with daily dosing sustaining benefits for anxiety-related cognitive deficits. - Antidepressive Action: - Quantitative Values: Classified as an antidepressive agent (MeSH); effective in anxiety with comorbid depression at 50-300 mg/day. - Influence: Alleviates fatigue and depressive symptoms associated with anxiety, improving mood without sedative burden. Onset: 2 hours; duration: 6-8 hours per dose. - Autonomic Regulation: - Quantitative Values: No specific IC50; observed at therapeutic doses. - Influence: Stabilizes autonomic nervous system, reducing symptoms like palpitations in anxiety. Paradoxical excitation possible (e.g., excitement, delirium), but rare. - Other Minor Actions: - No sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, amnestic, or motor-impairing effects (unlike 1,4-benzodiazepines). - Potential for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment via D-enantiomer (dextofisopam), with moderate efficacy in trials. - Predicted hERG inhibition: Weak (predictor I: 0.989; predictor II: non-inhibitor 0.8089), low cardiac risk. These actions are influenced by pharmacokinetics: Rapid absorption (Tmax 2 hours) leads to quick onset, while hepatic metabolism and 6-8 hour half-life allow for thrice-daily dosing without accumulation in short-term use. Half-Life - Elimination half-life: 6-8 hours (primary value from multiple sources; one source lists 3 hours, but 6-8 hours is more consistently reported). Bioavailabilities - Oral Bioavailability: Predicted as high (probability 1.0 based on computational models; no exact percentage available, but oral is the primary route with good absorption, reaching peak levels in 2 hours). No data on absolute bioavailability, but human intestinal absorption predicted as high (probability 1.0). - No data on other routes (e.g., IV, IM); tofisopam is primarily administered orally, with no significant differences reported for formulations. Dosages - Standard Therapeutic Dosage: 50-300 mg/day, divided into 3 doses (e.g., 50-100 mg three times daily) for anxiety and alcohol withdrawal. - Minimum Effective Dosage: Approximately 50 mg/day (lowest recommended starting dose; effective for mild anxiety). - Safe Range: 50-300 mg/day (prescription guideline; maximum 12 weeks to minimize dependence risk). - Maximum Without High Risks: 300 mg/day (upper limit of recommended range; exceeding this increases risk of paradoxical effects like excitation or interactions, but therapeutic index is high). - When It Starts to Become Too Dangerous: Doses exceeding 300 mg/day or chronic use beyond 12 weeks increase risks of dependence, withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, seizures), and interactions. Overdose symptoms (somnolence, coma) typically start at very large ingestions (e.g., >10x therapeutic dose), but deaths are rare alone due to high safety margin. Danger escalates with co-ingestion of CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol), leading to respiratory depression. Elderly/children are more susceptible at lower multiples (e.g., 2-5x dose). Toxicity and LD50 - LD50 Values (from animal studies): - Oral (rat): 825 mg/kg. - Intraperitoneal (rat): 1270 mg/kg. - Subcutaneous (rat): >10,000 mg/kg. - Intravenous (rat): 103 mg/kg. - Predicted rat acute toxicity: 2.6346 mol/kg (computational). - General Toxicity Profile: High therapeutic index; low mortality alone. Overdose causes rapid somnolence (onset faster with larger doses), progressing to Grade I/II coma. Rare respiratory depression or death without co-ingestants. Predicted non-carcinogenic (0.7679 probability), non-AMES toxic (0.6138), not readily biodegradable. GHS: Harmful if swallowed (H302); very toxic to aquatic life (H400). No human LD50 available, but extrapolated safety suggests doses >1 g could be dangerous in humans, with symptoms like ataxia, hypothermia, and amnesia.

    "url": "actions.html?md=uridine",
    "content": "Yes, uridine is related to the immune system and can play roles in conditions involving immunodeficiency. As a nucleoside and building block of RNA, uridine contributes to cellular energy metabolism and signaling pathways that support immune cell function. For instance, it can serve as an energy source for immune cells, helping to sustain their proliferative and responsive capacities during immune activation. Uridine also modulates overall immune function, potentially enhancing immunity through its involvement in nucleotide synthesis and related biochemical processes. Regarding immunodeficiency, uridine has been explored in therapeutic contexts for certain disorders. In congenital disorders of glycosylation like PGM3-CDG, which often present with immunodeficiency (e.g., increased infection susceptibility due to impaired immune cell development and function), uridine supplementation is used as a potential treatment to address glycosylation defects and support immune health. Additionally, in the context of HIV/AIDS management, uridine supplements have been studied for mitigating mitochondrial toxicity from antiretroviral drugs, which can indirectly affect immune recovery, though this is more about protecting cellular health rather than directly treating core immunodeficiency. Beyond these, modifications of uridine (such as pseudouridine or N1-methylpseudouridine) in mRNA vaccines and therapies are designed to evade or modulate innate immune detection, reducing unwanted inflammatory responses while allowing for effective therapeutic delivery. Unmodified uridine in RNA can trigger stronger antiviral and proinflammatory immune responses, which has implications for both immunity and potential immunodeficiencies in synthetic biology applications. However, these relationships are context-dependent, and uridine's effects can vary based on dosage, form, and specific health conditions—consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice."

Unfortunately, there is no high-quality clinical or pharmacokinetic data in the medical literature or official drug registries detailing precise pharmacological mechanisms, half-life, bioavailability, or safety/efficacy parameters. What does exist about Vasalamin comes from supplement vendors or product descriptions, not from peer-reviewed pharmacology or regulatory assessments. I’ve clearly separated the actual evidence from marketing claims below. --- 🧬 What Vasalamin is Vasalamin is described commercially as: • A complex of proteins and nucleoproteins derived from the blood vessels of animals (cattle/pigs). ([RUPharma][1]) • Mainly sold as oral tablets or capsules (≈155 mg/tablet; ≈10 mg peptide/protein complex per tablet). ([Peptide Shop][2]) ⚠️ Important: Vasalamin is not an approved pharmaceutical medication in regulated markets (e.g., EMA, FDA, MHRA) and does not have recognized pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles in scientific publications. Regulatory evaluation (safety, efficacy, PK/PD) by major agencies is not available. ([RUPharma][1]) --- 🧪 Pharmacological actions (claimed by sellers, not clinically proven) These are marketing claims from supplement product descriptions — not validated pharmacodynamics from human studies: 💡 Claimed actions 1. Selective support of vascular cells: Peptides purportedly help vascular cells synthesize essential proteins and restore damaged cells. ([RUPharma][1]) 2. Improving microcirculation (including brain). ([COSMOLL.ORG][3]) 3. Decreases atherosclerotic lesions of arteries (intra- and extracranial, peripheral). ([peptide-products.com][4]) 4. Increases capillary wall strength, reduces micro-hemorrhages. ([peptide-products.com][4]) 5. Decreases atherogenic lipoprotein fractions (claimed). ([peptide-products.com][4]) 6. Restores venous blood flow and reduces microcirculatory disturbances. ([peptide-products.com][4]) 👉 These descriptions use general physiological language (e.g., “restores vascular function”) but do not detail specific receptor targets, molecular mechanisms, or validated pharmacodynamics. Scholarly pharmacology databases do not contain peer-reviewed characterizations of Vasalamin’s pharmacological actions. --- 🧪 Pharmacokinetics (Half-life & Bioavailability) 🔬 Half-Life There is no published pharmacokinetic data showing: plasma half-life (t½) time to peak concentration (Tmax) elimination kinetics for Vasalamin. ⛔ While peptide drugs often have short systemic half-lives due to rapid enzymatic degradation (~minutes to hours) and poor oral absorption, this is a general property of peptides — not specific measured data for Vasalamin. ([PMC][5]) 🧪 Bioavailability Oral bioavailability is unknown — commercial descriptions imply oral tablets are effective, but no clinical studies report systemic absorption or pharmacokinetics. ([RUPharma][1]) General peptide science shows that oral bioavailability of peptides is usually very low (<2%) due to proteolytic degradation and poor intestinal absorption. ([PMC][5]) 👉 Without formal studies, any numeric claim for Vasalamin’s systemic exposure cannot be provided. --- 💊 Dosage Available product literature (not clinical guidelines): 📌 Oral (tablet/capsule) 1–3 tablets, 2–3 times per day, 10–15 min before meals. ([RUPharma][1]) Typical course duration: 10–15 days. ([RUPharma][1]) Repeat courses suggested every 3–6 months. ([RUPharma][1]) 💡 One tablet typically contains ~0.01 g (10 mg) of active peptide/protein complex. ([Peptide Shop][2]) ⚠️ These are manufacturer recommendations, not validated clinical doses. No minimum effective dose, therapeutic index, or formal safe range have been established in controlled human studies. --- ⚠️ Safety Profile & Side Effects There are no authoritative clinical safety studies on Vasalamin. Vendor materials often state “no side effects or accumulation,” but this is unverified marketing language. ([RUPharma][1]) Without regulatory or clinical data, you cannot assume safety — especially in people with: cardiovascular disease pregnancy chronic illness concurrent medications Always consult a healthcare provider before use. --- 🧠 Current Scientific Evidence Status ✔ There are no peer-reviewed human pharmacokinetic studies on Vasalamin. ✔ There are no controlled clinical trials supporting its efficacy. ✔ There is no standardized pharmacodynamic characterization in pharmacology references. The existing product claims come from supplement vendors and are marketing statements, not evidence-based pharmacology. --- 📌 Summary Table (what exists vs what does not) | Category | Known (Evidence) | Not Proven/Unknown | | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | | Mechanism of action | Claimed vascular support (marketing) | Verified molecular targets | | Pharmacokinetics | None published | Half-life, Tmax, AUC | | Bioavailability | Oral formulation exists | Actual systemic bioavailability | | Dosing | Manufacturer suggestions | Clinical dose-response curve | | Safety | No formal data | Adverse effects, toxicity profile | | Regulatory approval | None | EMA/FDA/MHRA approval | --- 🧠 General Note on Peptide/Protein Drugs Most peptide-based drugs have: poor oral absorption and low bioavailability unless specially formulated. ([PMC][5]) rapid degradation by gastrointestinal and systemic proteases. ([PMC][5]) Without modification (e.g., PEGylation, carriers), peptides typically have very short half-lives. ([PMC][5]) This general science explains why precise PK data for Vasalamin is likely absent — most peptide complexes are not orally bioavailable without specialized formulation. --- 🧠 Bottom Line No reliable pharmacological measurements exist for Vasalamin. All claims about actions, half-life, bioavailability, dose ranges, and safety are marketing material, not validated pharmacology. --- If you want, I can help you find any published clinical studies (if they exist) or explain why peptides generally have low oral bioavailability and short half-lives.

Most claims about its effects come from product descriptions rather than peer-reviewed studies. ([peptide-products.com][1]) --- 🧬 1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Ventramin is sold as a peptide and nucleoprotein complex extracted from the gastric mucosa of young animals (e.g., cattle). Claimed to be selective for gastric mucosal cells, supporting restoration and function after damage. ([peptide-products.com][1]) After oral ingestion, the peptides are said to break down into amino acids and nucleoproteins for cellular use.

    "content": "Vincamine, a natural alkaloid derived from the periwinkle plant, is primarily known for its vasodilatory and antioxidant effects, often used to support cerebral circulation and cognitive function. However, research indicates it can indeed relate to the immune system through its anti-inflammatory properties and modulation of immune-related signaling pathways. Relation to the Immune System Vincamine has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in various experimental models. For instance, it suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in human corneal epithelial cells by activating thioredoxin reductase and inhibiting pathways like NF-κB. Similarly, it protects against LPS-induced acute lung injury by modulating the Nrf2/NF-κB signaling cascade, reducing inflammatory cytokine production. NF-κB is a key regulator of immune responses, including inflammation and cytokine release, so vincamine's inhibition of this pathway suggests it can dampen overactive immune reactions. Additionally, vincamine activates Nrf2, a transcription factor that enhances antioxidant defenses and can influence immune cell function. In contexts like renal injury from methotrexate or cisplatin, vincamine upregulates Nrf2/HO-1 expression, which suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation while hindering inflammatory cascades involving TLR4 (a receptor involved in innate immunity). These actions position vincamine as a modulator of immune-mediated inflammation, potentially beneficial in conditions involving excessive immune activation, such as autoimmune disorders or inflammatory diseases. Vinpocetine, a semi-synthetic derivative of vincamine, shows similar effects, including mitigation of atopic dermatitis by reducing serum IgE levels, inflammatory cell infiltration, and epidermal hyperplasia. It also exerts neuroprotective anti-inflammatory effects in models of atherosclerosis and ischemia, partly by influencing adaptive immune responses. Given the close structural and pharmacological similarity, these findings extend to vincamine's potential immune-modulating role. Relation to Immunodeficiency There is no direct evidence linking vincamine to immunodeficiency, such as causing a weakened immune system (e.g., similar to immunosuppressive drugs used in organ transplants or conditions like HIV). However, in the context of cancer research, Nrf2 activation by vincamine in tumor-associated macrophages may promote anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities within the tumor microenvironment, potentially contributing to tumor resistance to therapies. This is not equivalent to systemic immunodeficiency but rather a localized immune modulation that could hinder anti-tumor immunity. Toxicity studies on vincamine note minimal short-term toxic effects, with some observed changes related to the immune system, but these are not detailed as causing immunodeficiency. Overall, vincamine's effects appear more aligned with balancing immune responses rather than broadly suppressing them to induce immunodeficiency. If you're considering vincamine for any health purpose, consult a healthcare professional, as its effects can vary based on dosage and individual factors."

    "title": "Vortioxetine",
    "url": "actions.html?md=vortioxetine",
    "content": "Vortioxetine (Brintellix/Trintellix) -- Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosage =============================================================================== Pharmacological Actions (Mechanism of Action) --------------------------------------------- Vortioxetine is a multimodal serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS). It strongly inhibits the serotonin transporter (SERT) (Ki≈1.6 nM; IC₅₀≈5.4 nM), greatly increasing synaptic 5-HT. It also directly modulates several 5-HT receptors: - 5-HT₃ antagonist: Ki≈3.7 nM. This blockade may reduce GI side effects and nausea and contribute to vortioxetine's antidepressant effect. - 5-HT₁A agonist: Ki≈15 nM. Agonism at 5-HT₁A (an autoreceptor and postsynaptic receptor) can enhance serotonergic neurotransmission. - 5-HT₁B partial agonist: Ki≈33 nM. Partial agonism at 5-HT₁B may modulate serotonin release. - 5-HT₁D antagonist: Ki≈54 nM. Blocking 5-HT₁D (an autoreceptor) may prevent negative feedback inhibition of 5-HT release. - 5-HT₇ antagonist: Ki≈19 nM. Antagonism at 5-HT₇ has been linked to pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects. At higher (weak) affinity, vortioxetine has negligible activity at other monoamine transporters: NET Ki≈113 nM and DAT Ki>1000 nM, so it is not considered an SNRI or NDRI. (Some reports list minor β₁-adrenergic or NET binding, but these are weak and clinically insignificant.) All these pharmacologic effects occur with the same drug concentration after dosing; in practice, vortioxetine's antidepressant action is thought to arise from the combined SERT blockade plus receptor modulation. Pharmacokinetics ---------------- - Absorption and Bioavailability: Vortioxetine is well absorbed orally with an absolute bioavailability of about 75%. Food does not appreciably affect its absorption. After an oral dose, plasma levels rise slowly: Tmax (time to peak concentration) is typically 7--11 hours. - Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is very large (~2500--3400 L), indicating extensive tissue uptake. Vortioxetine is highly protein-bound in plasma (about 98--99%), leaving ~1--2% free drug. - Metabolism: Vortioxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway is oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially CYP2D6, with contributions from CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP2C8) followed by glucuronidation. No major active metabolites contribute significantly to its pharmacologic effect. Vortioxetine itself does not induce or inhibit P450 enzymes at therapeutic levels, minimizing drug-drug interactions. - Elimination Half-Life: The terminal half-life is approximately 66 hours (mean; range ~59--69 h). This long half-life means vortioxetine accumulates with chronic dosing: steady-state is reached in about 2 weeks (≈12 days for 90% of steady-state). The accumulation ratio (steady-state AUC vs. single-dose AUC) is about 5--6. Vortioxetine pharmacokinetics are linear and dose-proportional from ~2.5 to 75 mg (single dose) and up to 60 mg (multiple doses). - Elimination: Clearance is mainly hepatic. An estimated 30--41 L/h of total clearance has been reported. Over 85% of the drug is recovered in 15 days after a radiolabeled dose (59% in urine, 26% in feces). Less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Because clearance depends heavily on CYP2D6, poor metabolizers have about twice the exposure of extensive metabolizers (and may require dose reduction). Therapeutic Dosing ------------------ - Indication: Major Depressive Disorder in adults. - Typical Dose Range: The usual starting dose is 10 mg once daily, taken orally. Depending on response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily. A 5 mg tablet is available for titration (e.g. starting at 5 mg in highly sensitive patients, then up to 10--20 mg). In clinical trials, doses of 5--20 mg/day were used; 10 mg is generally considered the minimum effective dose. (The manufacturer notes that doses above 20 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated.) - Dose Adjustments: For known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, a maximum of 10 mg/day is recommended due to higher exposure. Dose may be halved when coadministered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion) and increased (up to threefold the prior dose) with strong inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine). - Safety: In therapeutic trials (≤20 mg/day), vortioxetine was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, and sexual side effects (incidence ~4--6% at 20 mg, similar to SSRIs). Because of SERT inhibition, standard SSRI warnings apply (e.g. risk of serotonin syndrome, bleeding when combined with NSAIDs, and suicidality in youth). Overdose and Toxicity --------------------- - Acute LD50 (Animal): In rodents, the oral LD50 of vortioxetine hydrobromide is relatively high: ~300 mg/kg in mice and 500 mg/kg in rats. (Note: the base weight would be lower by ~20% on a molar basis.) These values indicate a large safety margin relative to human therapeutic doses. - Human Overdose Reports: Published case reports suggest vortioxetine is relatively non-toxic in overdose. For example, one report describes a 50-year-old man who ingested 250 mg (≈12× the 20 mg dose) and had no significant clinical effects. Another case involved a teenager who took 300 mg (30× a 10 mg dose); she experienced vomiting, abdominal pain and mild drowsiness but remained hemodynamically stable with no serotonin syndrome, and recovered with supportive care. These experiences suggest that even very large overdoses tend to produce only mild to moderate symptoms (mainly GI upset, dizziness, sedation) rather than life-threatening toxicity. - \"Too Dangerous\" Threshold: No specific human LD50 is established. The data imply that toxicity rises gradually well above therapeutic levels. Clinical trials tested single doses up to ~75 mg without serious harm, observing dose-dependent nausea and somnolence. Nonetheless, dosing above 20 mg/day is not recommended because safety beyond that is unproven. As with other SSRIs/SNRIs, serious toxicity (seizures, significant ECG changes) is more associated with multi-drug overdose; pure vortioxetine overdose cases have not shown fatal outcomes. In any overdose, standard supportive measures (gastric lavage/charcoal if early, cardiac monitoring) should be instituted. Pharmacokinetic Values Summary ------------------------------ - Bioavailability (oral): ≈75%. (No intravenous or other formulations are marketed; intravenous formulation has been used experimentally to \"load\" vortioxetine, achieving steady-state faster.) - Tmax: 7--11 hours post-dose. - Half-life: ~66 hours (59--69 h). - Distribution: Vd ~2600 L; protein binding ~98--99%. - Clearance: ~30--41 L/h. - Metabolism: Mainly hepatic (CYP2D6, others). <1% unchanged drug in urine. - Dosing: 5--20 mg/day; starting at 10 mg/day; max 20 mg/day (10 mg/day for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). - LD50 (animals): ~300 mg/kg (mouse), 500 mg/kg (rat). - Overdose: Human reports of 12--30× therapeutic dose (250--300 mg) caused only mild symptoms. These data indicate that vortioxetine has a long duration of action (due to long half-life), high oral bioavailability, and a wide margin of safety relative to its therapeutic dose. Dosing should follow guidelines (≤20 mg/day), and any overdose should be managed supportively. Sources: DrugBank, FDA/label data, clinical case reports, and pharmacokinetic studies."
